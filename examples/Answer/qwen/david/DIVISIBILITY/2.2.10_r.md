Okay, so I need to prove that for any integer n ≥ 1, the expression n(7n² + 5) is divisible by 6. That means I have to show that 6 divides this expression, or in other words, that n(7n² + 5) is a multiple of 6. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, maybe I can try expanding the expression to see if it simplifies to something that's obviously divisible by 6. Let's do that:

n(7n² + 5) = 7n³ + 5n.

So, the problem reduces to showing that 7n³ + 5n is divisible by 6. Alternatively, 7n³ + 5n ≡ 0 mod 6.

Another approach is to consider modulo 6. Since 6 is the product of 2 and 3, which are coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. That is, if I can show that 7n³ + 5n is divisible by both 2 and 3, then it must be divisible by 6. Let me check that.

First, check divisibility by 2. Let's compute 7n³ + 5n mod 2.

Note that 7 ≡ 1 mod 2 and 5 ≡ 1 mod 2. Therefore:

7n³ + 5n ≡ 1·n³ + 1·n mod 2 ≡ n³ + n mod 2.

Now, n³ + n. Let's factor that: n(n² + 1). Hmm, but maybe there's a better way. Let me check for n even or odd.

If n is even, then n ≡ 0 mod 2. Then n³ + n ≡ 0 + 0 = 0 mod 2.

If n is odd, then n ≡ 1 mod 2. Then n³ ≡ 1³ = 1 mod 2, and n ≡ 1 mod 2. So n³ + n ≡ 1 + 1 = 2 ≡ 0 mod 2.

So in either case, n³ + n is even. Therefore, 7n³ + 5n is divisible by 2. Great, that takes care of the modulo 2 part.

Now check divisibility by 3. Let's compute 7n³ + 5n mod 3.

First, 7 mod 3 is 1, since 7 = 2*3 + 1. Similarly, 5 mod 3 is 2. Therefore:

7n³ + 5n ≡ 1·n³ + 2·n mod 3 ≡ n³ + 2n mod 3.

So we need to show that n³ + 2n ≡ 0 mod 3. Let me check for n ≡ 0, 1, 2 mod 3.

Case 1: n ≡ 0 mod 3. Then n³ ≡ 0³ = 0 mod 3, and 2n ≡ 0 mod 3. So total is 0 + 0 = 0 mod 3. Good.

Case 2: n ≡ 1 mod 3. Then n³ ≡ 1³ = 1 mod 3, and 2n ≡ 2*1 = 2 mod 3. So total is 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Good.

Case 3: n ≡ 2 mod 3. Then n³ ≡ 8 ≡ 2 mod 3 (since 8 - 6 = 2). And 2n ≡ 2*2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. So total is 2 + 1 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Perfect.

Therefore, regardless of n mod 3, n³ + 2n ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, 7n³ + 5n is divisible by 3. Hence, since it's divisible by both 2 and 3, it's divisible by 6. Therefore, the original expression is of the form 6k.

Wait, but maybe I should check with some examples to make sure. Let me test n=1, 2, 3, etc.

For n=1: 1*(7*1 +5)=1*(7+5)=12, which is 6*2. Okay.

n=2: 2*(7*(4) +5)=2*(28 +5)=2*33=66, which is 6*11. Good.

n=3: 3*(7*9 +5)=3*(63 +5)=3*68=204, which is 6*34. Yep.

n=4: 4*(7*16 +5)=4*(112 +5)=4*117=468. 468 divided by 6 is 78. Correct.

n=5: 5*(7*25 +5)=5*(175 +5)=5*180=900. 900/6=150. Correct.

So examples check out. But maybe there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps by factoring or using modular arithmetic properties.

Alternatively, since we need to show that 7n³ + 5n is divisible by 6, maybe we can factor it or find some pattern. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe factor n(7n² +5). But I don't see an immediate factorization here. However, maybe considering modulo 6 directly.

But since we already did the modulo 2 and 3 approach, and that worked, maybe that's sufficient. But let me think again.

Alternatively, since 7n³ + 5n = 7n³ + 5n. Maybe we can write this as 7n³ + 5n = 7n³ + 5n. Let me see if there's a way to express this as something that's obviously divisible by 6.

Alternatively, think about parity and divisibility by 3.

But since we already have the modulo 2 and 3 approach, which works, maybe that's the way to go. But let me check if there's another way.

Alternatively, consider that 7n³ + 5n = 7n³ + 5n. Let me think about the expression modulo 6.

But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, think of 7n³ + 5n as 7n³ + 5n = 7n³ + 5n. Let me check if 7n³ ≡ -5n mod 6? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that n³ ≡ n mod 6? Wait, is that true?

Wait, for n mod 6, let's check n³ mod 6.

Let me check n from 0 to 5:

n=0: 0³=0 mod6.

n=1: 1 mod6.

n=2: 8 mod6=2.

n=3: 27 mod6=3.

n=4: 64 mod6=4.

n=5: 125 mod6=5.

So indeed, n³ ≡ n mod6. Therefore, n³ -n is divisible by 6. Therefore, n³ ≡n mod6.

Therefore, 7n³ +5n = 7n³ +5n. If n³ ≡n mod6, then 7n³ +5n ≡7n +5n=12n≡0 mod6. Because 12n is divisible by 6. Therefore, 7n³ +5n ≡0 mod6. Therefore, this shows that 7n³ +5n is divisible by 6. Therefore, the original expression is 6k.

Wait, that seems like a much simpler way. Because if n³ ≡n mod6, then 7n³ +5n ≡7n +5n=12n≡0 mod6. Therefore, the expression is divisible by 6. Therefore, that's a more straightforward approach. But how do we know that n³ ≡n mod6?

Well, as we saw earlier, for any integer n, n³ ≡n mod6. Let me verify that again.

Yes, because for any integer n, n³ -n =n(n² -1)=n(n-1)(n+1). Which is the product of three consecutive integers: (n-1), n, (n+1). Therefore, among any three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 2 and one is divisible by 3, so the product is divisible by 6. Therefore, n³ -n is divisible by 6, hence n³ ≡n mod6. Therefore, 7n³ +5n ≡7n +5n=12n≡0 mod6. Therefore, the expression is divisible by 6. Therefore, done.

So that's a more elegant way. Therefore, the key idea is that n³ ≡n mod6, which is because of the product of three consecutive integers. Therefore, this shows that 7n³ +5n ≡7n +5n=12n≡0 mod6. Therefore, the expression is divisible by 6.

Therefore, the conclusion is that n(7n² +5) is of the form 6k for any integer n≥1.

Alternatively, maybe I can also think about the original expression, n(7n² +5). Let me check if this is divisible by 2 and 3.

Divisible by 2: As before, we saw that n(7n² +5) is even. Because if n is even, then the whole expression is even. If n is odd, then 7n² is odd (since odd squared is odd, multiplied by 7 is odd), and 5 is odd, so odd + odd = even. Therefore, 7n² +5 is even when n is odd, so n(7n² +5) is odd * even = even. Therefore, divisible by 2.

Divisible by 3: Let's check. For divisibility by 3, we can consider n mod3. Let me check for n ≡0,1,2 mod3.

Case 1: n ≡0 mod3. Then n is divisible by 3, so the entire expression is divisible by 3.

Case 2: n ≡1 mod3. Then 7n² +5 ≡7*(1) +5=7+5=12≡0 mod3. Therefore, 7n² +5 is divisible by 3, so the entire expression is 1*(something divisible by 3) which is divisible by 3.

Case 3: n≡2 mod3. Then n² ≡4≡1 mod3. Therefore, 7n² +5 ≡7*1 +5=7+5=12≡0 mod3. Therefore, again, 7n² +5 is divisible by 3, so the entire expression is 2*(something divisible by 3), which is divisible by 3.

Therefore, regardless of n mod3, the expression is divisible by 3. Therefore, since it's divisible by 2 and 3, it's divisible by 6.

So both approaches confirm that the expression is divisible by 6. Therefore, the conclusion is correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is to use the fact that for any integer n, n(n² + 5/7) but that seems messy. Probably not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe using mathematical induction. Let me try that as another approach, just to verify.

Base case: n=1. 1*(7*1 +5)=12, which is 6*2. So holds.

Assume that for some k ≥1, k(7k² +5) is divisible by 6. Need to show that (k+1)(7(k+1)^2 +5) is divisible by 6.

But maybe induction is more complicated here because the expression is not linear in k. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe not necessary, since we already have two proofs. However, just for thoroughness, let me try.

But perhaps induction is not the most straightforward here, since the expression is a cubic, and the induction step would involve expanding (k+1)(7(k+1)^2 +5) and trying to relate it to k(7k² +5). But maybe it's possible.

Let me try:

Let’s denote f(n) = n(7n² +5). We need to show that f(n) is divisible by 6 for all n ≥1.

Assume f(k) is divisible by 6. Need to show f(k+1) is divisible by 6.

Compute f(k+1) = (k+1)[7(k+1)^2 +5] = (k+1)[7(k² + 2k +1) +5] = (k+1)[7k² +14k +7 +5] = (k+1)(7k² +14k +12).

Now, expand this:

= (k+1)(7k² +14k +12) = k*(7k² +14k +12) +1*(7k² +14k +12)

= 7k³ +14k² +12k +7k² +14k +12

= 7k³ + (14k² +7k²) + (12k +14k) +12

= 7k³ +21k² +26k +12.

Now, compare this to f(k) =7k³ +5k. The difference between f(k+1) and f(k) is:

[7k³ +21k² +26k +12] - [7k³ +5k] = 21k² +21k +12.

But I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express f(k+1) in terms of f(k) and something else.

Alternatively, since we know f(k) is divisible by 6, maybe we can find some relation. However, this seems messy. Maybe induction is not the best approach here. Since we already have two proofs, maybe it's better to stick with those.

Therefore, the conclusion is that n(7n² +5) is divisible by 6 for all integers n ≥1.

Alternatively, since we have two different proofs, one using modular arithmetic breaking into 2 and 3, and another using the fact that n³ ≡n mod6, which leads to the conclusion directly. Both methods confirm the result.

Therefore, the answer is established.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{6k}
</think>

To establish that the integer $ n(7n^2 + 5) $ is of the form $ 6k $ for all integers $ n \geq 1 $, we can proceed by analyzing the expression modulo 6. The goal is to show that $ n(7n^2 + 5) $ is divisible by 6, i.e., that $ n(7n^2 + 5) \equiv 0 \pmod{6} $.

---

### Step 1: Expand the Expression

We begin by expanding the expression:

$$
n(7n^2 + 5) = 7n^3 + 5n
$$

So, we are trying to show that $ 7n^3 + 5n \equiv 0 \pmod{6} $.

---

### Step 2: Use Modular Arithmetic

Note that 6 is the product of 2 and 3, which are coprime. Therefore, if we can show that $ 7n^3 + 5n \equiv 0 \pmod{2} $ and $ \pmod{3} $, then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it is divisible by 6.

#### Modulo 2:

- $ 7 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} $
- $ 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} $

So:

$$
7n^3 + 5n \equiv n^3 + n \pmod{2}
$$

Now, $ n^3 + n = n(n^2 + 1) $. If $ n $ is even, both terms are even. If $ n $ is odd, $ n^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} $, so $ n^2 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{2} $, and again the product is even. Hence, $ n^3 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{2} $, so the expression is divisible by 2.

#### Modulo 3:

- $ 7 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $
- $ 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} $

So:

$$
7n^3 + 5n \equiv n^3 + 2n \pmod{3}
$$

Now consider $ n^3 + 2n \mod 3 $ for $ n \equiv 0, 1, 2 \pmod{3} $:

- $ n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \Rightarrow n^3 + 2n \equiv 0 + 0 = 0 \pmod{3} $
- $ n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \Rightarrow 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $
- $ n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \Rightarrow 8 + 4 = 12 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $

Thus, $ n^3 + 2n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $ for all $ n $, so the expression is divisible by 3.

---

### Step 3: Combine Results

Since the expression is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6. Therefore, $ 7n^3 + 5n = n(7n^2 + 5) $ is divisible by 6 for all $ n \geq 1 $, which means it is of the form $ 6k $ for some integer $ k $.

\boxed{6k}
