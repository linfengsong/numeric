Okay, so I need to prove that for any integer a, 360 divides the product a²(a² - 1)(a² - 4). Hmm, 360 is the number we're dealing with here. Let me start by factoring 360 to understand its prime components. 

First, 360. Let me recall that 360 is 36 times 10, which is 2² * 3² * 5. Wait, let me check that again. 360 divided by 2 is 180, divided by 2 again is 90, divided by 2 again is 45. So that's 2³. Then 45 is 9*5, which is 3²*5. So altogether, 360 is 2³ * 3² * 5. So, to show that 360 divides the product, I need to show that the product is divisible by 8, 9, and 5. Because 8, 9, and 5 are pairwise coprime, so their least common multiple is 360. Therefore, if the product is divisible by each of these, then it's divisible by 360. 

So my task reduces to proving that a²(a² - 1)(a² - 4) is divisible by 8, 9, and 5. Let me tackle each prime power separately.

Starting with 5. Let me see. The product is a²(a² - 1)(a² - 4). So, we need to show that this product is divisible by 5. For that, at least one of the factors must be divisible by 5. Let me think about possible residues modulo 5. 

For any integer a, a mod 5 can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me check each case:

If a ≡ 0 mod 5, then a² ≡ 0 mod 5, so the first term is divisible by 5.

If a ≡ 1 mod 5, then a² ≡ 1 mod 5, so a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 5. Therefore, the second term is divisible by 5.

If a ≡ 2 mod 5, then a² = 4 mod 5. Then a² - 4 ≡ 0 mod 5. So third term is divisible by 5.

Similarly, if a ≡ 3 mod 5, then a² = 9 ≡ 4 mod 5. Then a² - 4 ≡ 0 mod 5. Again, third term.

If a ≡ 4 mod 5, then a² = 16 ≡ 1 mod 5. Then a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 5. Second term.

Therefore, in all cases, one of the factors is divisible by 5. Therefore, the entire product is divisible by 5. That takes care of the 5 component.

Now moving on to 8. So we need to show that the product is divisible by 8. Let me think about divisibility by 8. Since 8 is 2³, we need to have at least three factors of 2 in the product. Let me analyze the factors.

First, note that a² - 1 = (a - 1)(a + 1), and a² - 4 = (a - 2)(a + 2). So the entire product is a²*(a - 1)(a + 1)*(a - 2)(a + 2). Therefore, we can think of this as a²*(a - 2)(a - 1)(a + 1)(a + 2). 

So that's the product of five consecutive integers? Wait, not exactly. Let me check. Let me think of the numbers a - 2, a - 1, a, a + 1, a + 2. Wait, but here we have a² multiplied by those. Wait, but a² is a term. So the entire expression is a²*(a - 2)(a - 1)(a + 1)(a + 2). So that's a² multiplied by the product of four consecutive integers: (a - 2)(a - 1)(a)(a + 1)(a + 2). Wait, no, actually, it's a² multiplied by (a - 2)(a - 1)(a + 1)(a + 2). Wait, so that's not five consecutive integers. Let me check:

If we have (a - 2), (a - 1), a, (a + 1), (a + 2), that's five consecutive integers. But in our case, we have a² multiplied by (a - 2)(a - 1)(a + 1)(a + 2). So that's missing the term a. Wait, no. Wait, the original expression is a²*(a² - 1)*(a² - 4). Which is a²*(a - 1)(a + 1)*(a - 2)(a + 2). So that's a²*(a - 2)(a - 1)(a + 1)(a + 2). So that is a² multiplied by (a - 2)(a - 1)(a + 1)(a + 2). 

Alternatively, if we think of (a - 2)(a - 1)(a)(a + 1)(a + 2), that would be five consecutive integers. But here, we have a² multiplied by (a - 2)(a - 1)(a + 1)(a + 2). So that's equivalent to a²*(product of four consecutive integers: (a - 2)(a - 1)(a + 1)(a + 2)).

But maybe I can think of this as the product of five consecutive integers divided by a? Wait, not sure. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since we need to show that the product is divisible by 8, maybe we can analyze the factors of 2 in each term.

But maybe it's easier to consider cases based on the parity of a. Let me think.

Case 1: a is even. Then a is divisible by 2. So a² is divisible by 4. Also, since a is even, let's check the other terms. Let me think about the product (a - 2)(a - 1)(a + 1)(a + 2). Since a is even, then a - 2, a - 1, a + 1, a + 2. So a is even, so a - 2 and a + 2 are even numbers. Also, a - 1 and a + 1 are odd numbers. Therefore, among the four terms (a - 2), (a - 1), (a + 1), (a + 2), there are two even numbers: a - 2 and a + 2. So each of these is even. Therefore, their product is divisible by 2*2 = 4. Therefore, the entire product is a²*(something divisible by 4). Since a² is divisible by 4 (as a is even), then total is divisible by 4*4 = 16. Wait, but we need divisibility by 8. So 16 is more than 8, so that's okay. Therefore, in this case, the product is divisible by 16, hence by 8.

Case 2: a is odd. Then a is odd. Then a² is odd. Then let's look at the terms (a - 2), (a - 1), (a + 1), (a + 2). Since a is odd, a - 1 and a + 1 are even numbers. Also, a - 2 and a + 2: since a is odd, subtracting 2 (even) gives odd minus even is odd, so a - 2 is odd, and a + 2 is also odd. Therefore, among the four terms, (a - 1) and (a + 1) are even. Therefore, their product is divisible by 2*2 = 4. Therefore, the entire product is a²*(something divisible by 4). Since a² is odd, then the total is divisible by 4. But we need divisibility by 8. So 4 is not enough. Therefore, maybe there's more?

Wait, but maybe there are more factors of 2 in the product. Let me check. If a is odd, then (a - 1) and (a + 1) are consecutive even numbers. Therefore, one of them is divisible by 2 and the other is divisible by 4? Wait, consecutive even numbers differ by 2. So for example, if we have two consecutive even numbers, say 2k and 2k + 2. Then one of them is divisible by 4. Because if k is even, then 2k is divisible by 4, and if k is odd, then 2k + 2 = 2(k + 1) is divisible by 4. Therefore, in any case, among two consecutive even numbers, one is divisible by 4. Therefore, their product is divisible by 4*2 = 8? Wait, no. Wait, if one is divisible by 4 and the other is divisible by 2, then their product is divisible by 4*2 = 8. Therefore, the product (a - 1)(a + 1) is divisible by 8. Therefore, the entire product is a²*(something divisible by 8). Since a² is odd, then the total is divisible by 8. Therefore, in this case, when a is odd, the product is divisible by 8. 

Therefore, regardless of whether a is even or odd, the product is divisible by 8. Therefore, the divisibility by 8 is satisfied.

Now moving on to 9. So we need to show that the product is divisible by 9, which is 3². So we need at least two factors of 3 in the product. Let me think about how to approach this.

Again, considering the expression a²(a² - 1)(a² - 4). Let me note that a² - 1 = (a - 1)(a + 1), and a² - 4 = (a - 2)(a + 2). Therefore, the product is a²*(a - 1)(a + 1)*(a - 2)(a + 2). So that's the product of five terms: a², (a - 1), (a + 1), (a - 2), (a + 2). 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a²*(a - 2)(a - 1)(a + 1)(a + 2). So, again, similar to before, but with different terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the residues modulo 3. Let me think. For any integer a, a mod 3 can be 0, 1, or 2. Let me check each case.

Case 1: a ≡ 0 mod 3. Then a is divisible by 3, so a² is divisible by 9. Therefore, the entire product is divisible by 9.

Case 2: a ≡ 1 mod 3. Then a - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, (a - 1) is divisible by 3. Also, a + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, (a + 2) is also divisible by 3. Therefore, the product has two factors of 3: (a - 1) and (a + 2). Therefore, the product is divisible by 3² = 9.

Case 3: a ≡ 2 mod 3. Then a + 1 ≡ 2 + 1 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, (a + 1) is divisible by 3. Also, a - 2 ≡ 2 - 2 = 0 mod 3. Therefore, (a - 2) is divisible by 3. Therefore, again, two factors of 3: (a - 2) and (a + 1). Therefore, the product is divisible by 9.

Therefore, in all cases, the product is divisible by 9. Therefore, the divisibility by 9 is satisfied.

So, putting it all together: the product is divisible by 5, 8, and 9. Since 5, 8, and 9 are pairwise coprime, their least common multiple is 5*8*9 = 360. Therefore, the product is divisible by 360. Therefore, 360 divides a²(a² - 1)(a² - 4) for any integer a. 

Wait, but let me check if there are any possible overlaps or if I missed something. For example, when considering divisibility by 8, in the case when a is even, we had that the product is divisible by 16, which is more than 8, so that's fine. When a is odd, the product is divisible by 8. For divisibility by 9, in all cases, we have at least two factors of 3. For divisibility by 5, as shown earlier, in all cases, one of the factors is divisible by 5. 

But maybe I should test with some examples to make sure. Let me take a = 0. Then the product is 0²*(0 - 1)*(0 - 4) = 0. 0 is divisible by 360. Okay.

Take a = 1. Then product is 1²*(1 - 1)*(1 - 4) = 1*0*(-3) = 0. Again, 0 is divisible by 360.

Take a = 2. Then product is 4*(4 - 1)*(4 - 4) = 4*3*0 = 0. Still 0.

Take a = 3. Then product is 9*(9 - 1)*(9 - 4) = 9*8*5 = 360. Which is exactly 360. So 360 divides 360, which is true.

Take a = 4. Then product is 16*(16 - 1)*(16 - 4) = 16*15*12. Let me compute that. 16*15 = 240, 240*12 = 2880. 2880 divided by 360 is 8. So yes, divisible.

Take a = 5. Then product is 25*(25 - 1)*(25 - 4) = 25*24*21. Let me compute 25*24 = 600, 600*21 = 12600. 12600 / 360 = 35. So yes, divisible.

Take a = 6. Product is 36*(36 - 1)*(36 - 4) = 36*35*32. Let me compute 36*35 = 1260, 1260*32 = 40320. 40320 / 360 = 112. So yes, divisible.

Another test case, a = 7. Then product is 49*(49 - 1)*(49 - 4) = 49*48*45. 49*48 = 2352, 2352*45. Let me compute 2352*45. Well, 2352*45 = 2352*(40 + 5) = 2352*40 + 2352*5 = 94080 + 11760 = 105,840. Divided by 360: 105840 / 360. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 10: 10584 / 36. Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 882 / 3 = 294. So yes, 294. So divisible.

So seems like the examples check out. Therefore, my reasoning seems correct.

But let me think again about divisibility by 8. Suppose a is even. Then a is divisible by 2. Then a² is divisible by 4. Also, in the product (a - 2)(a - 1)(a + 1)(a + 2), there are two even numbers: a - 2 and a + 2. Since a is even, a - 2 and a + 2 are both even. Let me check if they are both divisible by 2, but maybe one is divisible by 4. For example, if a is even, then a = 2k. Then a - 2 = 2k - 2 = 2(k - 1), and a + 2 = 2k + 2 = 2(k + 1). So both are divisible by 2, but whether they are divisible by 4 depends on k. If k is even, then k - 1 is odd, so 2(k - 1) is 2*odd, so divisible by 2 but not 4. Similarly, k + 1 is odd, so 2(k + 1) is also 2*odd. Therefore, their product is (2*odd)*(2*odd) = 4*odd*odd, which is divisible by 4. Therefore, the product (a - 2)(a + 2) is divisible by 4. Then, since a² is divisible by 4, the total product is divisible by 4*4 = 16. Therefore, divisible by 8.

But if a is even, then a = 2k. Then the entire product is (2k)^2*(something divisible by 4). Which is 4k² * 4m = 16k²m, which is divisible by 8.

Alternatively, if a is odd, then (a - 1) and (a + 1) are consecutive even numbers. Therefore, one is divisible by 2 and the other by 4. Therefore, their product is divisible by 8. Then since a² is odd, the total product is odd * 8, which is divisible by 8. Therefore, yes, that works.

For divisibility by 9, as shown earlier, in each case, there are two factors of 3. For example, if a is divisible by 3, then a² is divisible by 9. If not, then either a - 1 or a + 2 is divisible by 3, and another term is also divisible by 3. Therefore, two factors of 3. Therefore, the product is divisible by 9.

Therefore, all the required factors are present. Therefore, the product is divisible by 8, 9, and 5, hence by 360. Therefore, the assertion is proven.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{360}
</think>

To establish the assertion that for any integer $ a $, the expression $ 360 \mid a^2(a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4) $, we proceed by analyzing the divisibility of the product by the prime power components of 360.

---

### Step 1: Factorization of 360

We begin by factoring 360 into its prime components:

$$
360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5
$$

This tells us that for the given expression to be divisible by 360, it must be divisible by $ 2^3 = 8 $, $ 3^2 = 9 $, and $ 5 $.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Expression

We are given the expression:

$$
a^2(a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)
$$

This can be factored further:

$$
a^2(a - 1)(a + 1)(a - 2)(a + 2)
$$

This is the product of five terms: $ a^2 $, $ a - 1 $, $ a + 1 $, $ a - 2 $, $ a + 2 $. These represent the square of $ a $, and four consecutive terms around $ a $, i.e., the product of five consecutive integers if we consider $ a - 2, a - 1, a, a + 1, a + 2 $, but with $ a $ appearing squared.

---

### Step 3: Check Divisibility by 5

We examine the expression modulo 5. For any integer $ a $, $ a \mod 5 $ can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

- If $ a \equiv 0 \mod 5 $, then $ a^2 \equiv 0 \mod 5 $
- If $ a \equiv 1 \mod 5 $, then $ a^2 - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 5 $
- If $ a \equiv 2 \mod 5 $, then $ a^2 - 4 \equiv 0 \mod 5 $
- If $ a \equiv 3 \mod 5 $, then $ a^2 - 4 \equiv 0 \mod 5 $
- If $ a \equiv 4 \mod 5 $, then $ a^2 - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 5 $

In all cases, one of the factors is divisible by 5, so the entire product is divisible by 5.

---

### Step 4: Check Divisibility by 8

We consider the expression:

$$
a^2(a - 1)(a + 1)(a - 2)(a + 2)
$$

Let’s analyze the powers of 2 in the product.

- If $ a $ is **even**, then $ a^2 $ is divisible by $ 4 $, and $ a - 2 $ and $ a + 2 $ are even, so their product is divisible by $ 4 $. Hence, the entire product is divisible by $ 4 \times 4 = 16 $, which is divisible by 8.
- If $ a $ is **odd**, then $ a - 1 $ and $ a + 1 $ are consecutive even numbers, one of which is divisible by 4. So their product is divisible by $ 8 $, and since $ a^2 $ is odd, the total product is still divisible by 8.

Thus, the product is always divisible by 8.

---

### Step 5: Check Divisibility by 9

We analyze the expression modulo 3. For any $ a \mod 3 $, the possible residues are 0, 1, or 2.

- If $ a \equiv 0 \mod 3 $, then $ a^2 \equiv 0 \mod 9 $, so the product is divisible by 9.
- If $ a \equiv 1 \mod 3 $, then $ a - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $, and $ a + 2 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $, so two factors are divisible by 3.
- If $ a \equiv 2 \mod 3 $, then $ a + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $, and $ a - 2 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $, so again two factors are divisible by 3.

In all cases, the product has at least two factors of 3, so it is divisible by $ 3^2 = 9 $.

---

### Step 6: Conclusion

Since the expression is divisible by 8, 9, and 5, and these are pairwise coprime, it is divisible by their least common multiple:

$$
\text{lcm}(8, 9, 5) = 360
$$

Thus, for any integer $ a $, the expression $ a^2(a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4) $ is divisible by 360.

$$
\boxed{360}
$$
