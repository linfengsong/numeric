Okay, so I need to prove two things here. First, that the sum of the squares of two odd integers can't be a perfect square. Second, that the product of four consecutive integers is 1 less than a perfect square. Let me start with part (a).

For part (a), let me recall that an odd integer can be written in the form 2k + 1, where k is an integer. So if I have two odd integers, say, a and b, then their squares would be (2k + 1)^2 and (2m + 1)^2 for some integers k and m. Let me compute their sum:

(2k + 1)^2 + (2m + 1)^2 = 4k² + 4k + 1 + 4m² + 4m + 1 = 4(k² + k + m² + m) + 2.

So the sum is 4 times something plus 2. Now, a perfect square can be congruent to 0 or 1 mod 4, right? Because squares mod 4 are either 0 or 1. Let me check:

If a number is even, it's 0 mod 2, but mod 4, even numbers can be 0 or 2. But squares: if a number is even, say 2n, then (2n)^2 = 4n², which is 0 mod 4. If a number is odd, say 2n + 1, then (2n + 1)^2 = 4n² + 4n + 1, which is 1 mod 4. Therefore, squares are either 0 or 1 mod 4.

So our sum is 4(...) + 2, which is 2 mod 4. But perfect squares can't be 2 mod 4. Therefore, the sum of two odd squares is 2 mod 4, which is not a square. Therefore, it's impossible. So that proves part (a). Wait, is that all? Let me check with some examples. For example, 1² + 1² = 2, which is not a square. 1² + 3² = 1 + 9 = 10, not a square. 3² + 3² = 18, not a square. 1² + 5² = 26, not a square. Seems like it's true. So maybe that's the proof.

But maybe I should think again. Suppose that the sum is 2 mod 4. Since squares are 0 or 1 mod 4, then 2 mod 4 can't be a square. Therefore, the conclusion follows. So that's straightforward. So part (a) seems done.

Now part (b): The product of four consecutive integers is 1 less than a perfect square. Let me think. Let me denote the four consecutive integers as n, n+1, n+2, n+3. Their product is n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3). I need to show that this product is equal to some perfect square minus 1. So, n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) + 1 is a perfect square.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to express the product in terms of squares. Let me try to compute the product. Maybe I can pair them. For example, n(n+3) and (n+1)(n+2). Let's compute:

n(n+3) = n² + 3n

(n+1)(n+2) = n² + 3n + 2

So the product is (n² + 3n)(n² + 3n + 2). Let me set m = n² + 3n. Then the product is m(m + 2) = m² + 2m. Then adding 1 gives m² + 2m + 1 = (m + 1)^2. Therefore, the product of the four consecutive integers is (m + 1)^2 - 1. Therefore, the product is 1 less than a perfect square. Therefore, that's the proof.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check with an example. Let me take n = 1: 1*2*3*4 = 24. Then 24 + 1 = 25, which is 5². Correct. Another example: n = 2: 2*3*4*5 = 120. 120 + 1 = 121 = 11². Correct. n = 0: 0*1*2*3 = 0. 0 + 1 = 1 = 1². Correct. n = -1: (-1)(0)(1)(2) = 0. 0 + 1 = 1. Correct. So seems like it works. So the key idea is to pair the terms and express the product as m(m + 2), then adding 1 gives a square. Therefore, the product is 1 less than a square.

But maybe I need to formalize this more. Let me write it again.

Let me denote the four consecutive integers as n, n+1, n+2, n+3. Then:

n(n+3) = n² + 3n

(n+1)(n+2) = n² + 3n + 2

Therefore, the product is (n² + 3n)(n² + 3n + 2) = [let me call x = n² + 3n], then x(x + 2) = x² + 2x. Then x² + 2x + 1 = (x + 1)^2. Therefore, the original product is (x + 1)^2 - 1. Therefore, the product is 1 less than a perfect square. Therefore, proved.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. For example, using the identity that for four consecutive integers, their product can be written as (n^2 + 3n + 1)^2 - 1? Wait, but according to the above, it's (x + 1)^2 - 1 where x = n² + 3n. So that would be (n² + 3n + 1)^2 - 1. Therefore, the product is equal to that. Therefore, the product is 1 less than (n² + 3n + 1)^2. So that's the perfect square.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more general formula. But regardless, the algebra seems to check out.

But let me check with n=1: n² + 3n + 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5, which squared is 25, 25 - 1 = 24, which is 1*2*3*4. Correct. For n=2: 4 + 6 + 1 = 11, 121 - 1 = 120, which is 2*3*4*5. Correct. So yes, that works.

Therefore, part (b) is proved.

Wait, but maybe I need to check for negative numbers? Let me take n=-2: the four consecutive integers would be -2, -1, 0, 1. The product is (-2)(-1)(0)(1) = 0. Then 0 + 1 = 1 = 1². Correct. Similarly, n=-3: -3, -2, -1, 0. Product is 0. 0 + 1 = 1. Correct. So even if some of the numbers are negative, the product is still 0 or positive, and adding 1 gives a square. So seems like it works.

Alternatively, maybe there's a case where the product is negative? For example, if n is negative and the four numbers include both negative and positive numbers. Wait, but if n is negative, say n=-4: -4, -3, -2, -1. The product is (-4)(-3)(-2)(-1) = 24. Then 24 + 1 = 25 = 5². Correct. So even if all four numbers are negative, the product is positive, and adding 1 gives a square. So that works.

Therefore, the proof seems solid.

So for part (a), I think the key was to note that the sum of two odd squares is 2 mod 4, which can't be a square. For part (b), pairing the terms and using algebra to show that the product plus 1 is a square.

Wait, but maybe I should check if there's a case where the product is 1 less than a square. For example, if the product is 0, then 0 + 1 = 1, which is 1². So that's covered. If the product is 24, then 25 is 5². So that's covered. So yes, seems like the proof is correct.

Therefore, I think both parts are proven.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{\text{The sum of the squares of two odd integers cannot be a perfect square.}}

(b) \boxed{\text{The product of four consecutive integers is 1 less than a perfect square.}}

To prove the two statements, we analyze them separately and provide rigorous mathematical reasoning.

### **(a) The sum of the squares of two odd integers cannot be a perfect square.**

Let the two odd integers be $ a = 2k + 1 $ and $ b = 2m + 1 $, where $ k, m \in \mathbb{Z} $.

Then, their squares are:
$$
a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1,\quad b^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1
$$

Adding these:
$$
a^2 + b^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 4(k^2 + k + m^2 + m) + 2
$$

Let’s denote $ S = 4(k^2 + k + m^2 + m) + 2 $. This expression is congruent to $ 2 \mod 4 $, since the term $ 4(\cdot) $ is divisible by 4.

Now, consider the possible values of a perfect square modulo 4:

- If a number is even, its square is $ 0 \mod 4 $.
- If a number is odd, its square is $ 1 \mod 4 $.

Therefore, a perfect square can only be $ 0 $ or $ 1 \mod 4 $, but our expression $ S $ is $ 2 \mod 4 $, which is not a possible residue for a perfect square.

Hence, the sum of the squares of two odd integers **cannot** be a perfect square.

$$
\boxed{\text{The sum of the squares of two odd integers cannot be a perfect square.}}

### **(b) The product of four consecutive integers is 1 less than a perfect square.**

Let the four consecutive integers be $ n, n+1, n+2, n+3 $. Their product is:
$$
P = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)
$$

We can group the terms as:
$$
P = [n(n+3)][(n+1)(n+2)] = (n^2 + 3n)(n^2 + 3n + 2)
$$

Let $ x = n^2 + 3n $. Then:
$$
P = x(x + 2) = x^2 + 2x
$$

Now, add 1 to this:
$$
P + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x + 1)^2
$$

Thus, the product of the four consecutive integers is:
$$
P = (x + 1)^2 - 1
$$

This shows that the product is **1 less than a perfect square**, specifically $ (x + 1)^2 $, where $ x = n^2 + 3n $.

This result holds for all integers $ n $, including negative values, as verified by testing specific cases.

$$
\boxed{\text{The product of four consecutive integers is 1 less than a perfect square.}}
