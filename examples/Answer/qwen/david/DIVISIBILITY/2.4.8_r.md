Okay, so I need to find the least common multiples (LCMs) of three pairs of numbers: (143, 227), (306, 657), and (272, 1479). Hmm, let me remember how to calculate LCMs. I think the standard method is to use the formula that involves the greatest common divisor (GCD). The formula is LCM(a, b) = |a * b| / GCD(a, b). Right? So first, I need to find the GCD of each pair and then apply that formula. Alternatively, I could factor each number into primes and then take the highest power of each prime that appears. Maybe that's another way. Let me try both methods for each pair to see which is easier.

Starting with the first pair: 143 and 227. Let me check if they have any common factors. First, maybe factor each number. Let's start with 143. Hmm, 143... Let me think. 11 times 13 is 143? Let me check: 11*13 is 143? 11*10 is 110, 11*13 is 143. Yes, that's right. So 143 factors into 11 and 13. Now 227... Hmm, is 227 a prime number? Let me check. Let's try dividing by small primes. 2? No, it's odd. 3? 2+2+7=11, which isn't divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7, so no. 7? Let's do 227 divided by 7. 7*32 is 224, so 227-224=3, so remainder 3. Not divisible by 7. 11? 11*20 is 220, 227-220=7, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*17 is 221, 227-221=6, not divisible by 13. 17? 17*13 is 221 again, 17*14 is 238, which is higher. So 227 doesn't seem to be divisible by any primes up to its square root. What's the square root of 227? Around 15. So since it's not divisible by primes up to 15, it must be prime. So 227 is a prime number. Therefore, the factors of 143 are 11 and 13, and 227 is prime. Since there are no common factors between 143 and 227, their GCD is 1. Therefore, LCM(143, 227) is (143*227)/1 = 143*227. Let me compute that. Hmm, 143*200 is 28,600, and 143*27 is... Let me compute 143*27. 143*20=2,860, 143*7=1,001. So 2,860 + 1,001 = 3,861. Therefore, total is 28,600 + 3,861 = 32,461. So LCM is 32,461. Let me check if that makes sense. Since they are co-prime, LCM is indeed their product. Okay, that seems straightforward.

Now moving on to the second pair: 306 and 657. Let me find their GCD first. Maybe factor both numbers. Starting with 306. Let me divide by 2 first: 306 / 2 = 153. Then 153 is divisible by 3: 153 / 3 = 51. Then 51 / 3 = 17. So 306 factors into 2 * 3^2 * 17. Now 657. Let me check divisibility. 6+5+7=18, which is divisible by 3, so 657 / 3 = 219. Then 219 / 3 = 73. So 657 factors into 3^2 * 73. Now, looking for common factors between 306 and 657. The prime factors of 306 are 2, 3, 17. The prime factors of 657 are 3, 73. So the common prime factor is 3. The minimum exponent for 3 in both is 2 (since 3^2 in both). Therefore, GCD is 3^2 = 9. Therefore, LCM is (306 * 657)/9. Let me compute that. Alternatively, since LCM is product divided by GCD, so let me compute 306*657 first, then divide by 9. But maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since 306 is 2 * 3^2 * 17, and 657 is 3^2 * 73. So LCM would take the highest exponents of each prime. So 2^1, 3^2, 17^1, 73^1. Therefore, LCM is 2 * 9 * 17 * 73. Let me compute that step by step. 2*9 is 18. 18*17: 18*10=180, 18*7=126, total 306. Then 306*73. Hmm, 300*73 + 6*73. 300*73 is 21,900. 6*73 is 438. Adding them together: 21,900 + 438 = 22,338. Therefore, LCM is 22,338. Let me check with the other method. 306*657 divided by 9. Let me compute 306 divided by 9 first. 306 / 9 = 34. Then 34 * 657. Let me compute that. 34*600 = 20,400. 34*57 = let's compute 34*50=1,700 and 34*7=238, so total 1,700 + 238 = 1,938. Then total is 20,400 + 1,938 = 22,338. Yep, same result. So that seems correct.

Now the third pair: 272 and 1479. Let me find their LCM. Again, first find GCD. Let me factor both numbers. Starting with 272. 272 is even, so divide by 2: 272 / 2 = 136. Again divide by 2: 136 / 2 = 68. Again by 2: 68 / 2 = 34. Again by 2: 34 / 2 = 17. So 272 factors into 2^4 * 17. Now 1479. Let me check divisibility. Let's try dividing by small primes. First, check if it's even? No. Sum of digits: 1+4+7+9=21, which is divisible by 3. So 1479 / 3 = 493. Now check 493. Let me see if 493 is divisible by 3: 4+9+3=16, not divisible by 3. Next, 5? No. 7? Let me check 493 divided by 7: 7*70=490, so 493-490=3, so remainder 3. Not divisible by 7. 11? Let me do the alternating sum: 4 - 9 + 3 = -2, not divisible by 11. 13? Let me try 13*38 is 494, which is 1 more than 493, so no. 17? Let me check 17*29 is 493? 17*20=340, 17*29=340 + 17*9= 340 + 153= 493. Yes! So 17*29=493. Therefore, 1479 factors into 3 * 17 * 29. So the prime factors of 272 are 2^4 * 17, and 1479 is 3 * 17 * 29. Therefore, common prime factor is 17. So GCD is 17. Therefore, LCM is (272 * 1479)/17. Let me compute that. Alternatively, take the LCM by taking the highest powers of primes. For 272: 2^4, 17. For 1479: 3, 17, 29. So LCM is 2^4 * 3 * 17 * 29. Let me compute that. First, 2^4 is 16. 16 * 3 is 48. 48 * 17: 48*10=480, 48*7=336, total 816. Then 816 * 29. Let me compute that. 800*29 = 23,200. 16*29 = 464. So total is 23,200 + 464 = 23,664. Alternatively, using the other method: 272 * 1479 divided by 17. Let me compute 272 / 17 first. 17*16=272, so 272 /17=16. Therefore, LCM is 16 * 1479. Let me compute 16 * 1479. 10*1479=14,790. 6*1479=8,874. Adding them together: 14,790 + 8,874. Let's do 14,790 + 8,000 = 22,790. Then + 874 = 23,664. Same result. So that's correct. Therefore, LCM(272, 1479) is 23,664.

Wait, let me just check if there's any mistake in the factorization. For 1479, we had 3*17*29. Let me verify 3*17 is 51, 51*29. 50*29=1,450, 1*29=29, so total 1,479. Yes, correct. And 272 is 16*17, which is 2^4 *17. So yes, GCD is 17. So LCM is 16*3*17*29, which is 16*3* (17*29). 17*29 is 493, so 16*3*493. 16*3 is 48, 48*493. Wait, but earlier I did 16*3*17*29 as 16*3* (17*29) which is 16*3*493. But when I did 16*1479, that's the same thing. So that's correct. So 23,664 is the LCM. Okay, seems solid.

So summarizing:

For (143, 227): LCM is 143*227 = 32,461.

For (306, 657): LCM is 22,338.

For (272, 1479): LCM is 23,664.

I think that's all. Let me just check once more for any possible miscalculations.

First pair: 143*227. Let me verify 143*227. Let me do 143*(200 + 27) = 143*200 + 143*27. 143*200 is 28,600. 143*27: 143*20=2,860; 143*7=1,001. Adding them gives 2,860 + 1,001 = 3,861. Then total is 28,600 + 3,861 = 32,461. Correct.

Second pair: 306*657 / 9. 306 / 9 = 34. 34*657. Let me compute 34*657. 34*600=20,400; 34*50=1,700; 34*7=238. So 20,400 + 1,700 = 22,100; 22,100 + 238 = 22,338. Correct.

Third pair: 272*1479 /17. 272 /17=16. 16*1479. 16*1000=16,000; 16*400=6,400; 16*79=1,264. So 16,000 + 6,400 = 22,400 + 1,264 = 23,664. Correct.

Therefore, all three LCMs are correct.

**Final Answer**
The LCMs are $\boxed{32461}$, $\boxed{22338}$, and $\boxed{23664}$.
