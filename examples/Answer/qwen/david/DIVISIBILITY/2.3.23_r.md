Okay, so I need to show that if a divides the product of b and d, then a divides the greatest common divisor of a and b multiplied by the greatest common divisor of a and c. Let me write that down to make sure I have it right.

The problem says: If a | bd, show that a | gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c).

First, let me recall what it means for a number to divide another. If a divides bd, that means there exists some integer k such that bd = a * k. But I don't know if that's immediately helpful. Maybe I need to use properties of the greatest common divisor.

I remember that the gcd of two numbers is the largest number that divides both. Also, there's the property that gcd(a, b) divides both a and b. So, if I have gcd(a, b) and gcd(a, c), then each of these divides a. Therefore, their product would also divide a? Wait, no. If two numbers divide a, their product might not necessarily divide a. For example, if a is 6, then 2 and 3 both divide 6, but 2*3=6 divides 6. But if a is 12, then 4 and 6 both divide 12, but 4*6=24 doesn't divide 12. So, in general, the product of two divisors of a doesn't necessarily divide a. Therefore, my initial thought is wrong.

So, maybe I need a different approach. The problem says that a divides bd. So, a | bd. I need to show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c). Let me think about how to relate these two statements.

Let me denote d1 = gcd(a, b) and d2 = gcd(a, c). So, the problem is to show that a divides d1*d2. Alternatively, that d1*d2 is a multiple of a. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the fact that if a divides bd, then a divides some combination of b and d. But I need to connect that with the gcds.

Let me recall that if a divides bd, then any common divisor of a and b must divide a, and since a divides bd, maybe there's some relation here. Wait, maybe I need to use the property that gcd(a, b) divides a and gcd(a, b) divides b. Similarly for gcd(a, c).

Alternatively, maybe I can write a as a product of its prime factors and see how that relates to the gcds. But that might be too complicated.

Alternatively, think about the prime factors of a. Suppose that a has prime factors p1, p2, ..., pn. Then, since a divides bd, each prime factor of a must divide bd. Therefore, each prime factor of a divides either b or d. But how does that relate to gcd(a, b) and gcd(a, c)?

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention c and d. Wait, the problem says a divides bd, and we need to show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c). Wait, but where does c come into play? The original problem didn't mention c in the premise. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the problem says: If a divides bd, show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c). Wait, but where does c come from? Is there a typo? Or is there more to the problem? Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

Original problem: If a | bd, show that a | gcd(a, b) gcd(a, c). Hmm. Wait, maybe there is a missing part? Or maybe c is related to d? Or maybe it's a different problem? Wait, maybe the problem is in a context where c is related to d? Or maybe there's a typo and it should be gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d)? But the user wrote gcd(a, c). Maybe that's a mistake? Or maybe the problem is correct as stated?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a specific context where c is related to d? But without more information, I need to work with what's given.

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo and the problem is supposed to be a | bd, show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). That would make more sense because then we can use the fact that a divides bd, so the gcd(a, b) divides a and divides b, and gcd(a, d) divides a and divides d. Then, their product would divide a? Wait, but earlier I saw that that's not necessarily true. However, if a divides bd, then maybe the product of gcd(a, b) and gcd(a, d) divides a?

Wait, but maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose a divides bd. Then, for each prime factor of a, it divides either b or d. Therefore, the gcd(a, b) would include the primes that divide both a and b, and gcd(a, d) would include the primes that divide both a and d. Therefore, the product gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) would include primes that divide a, but maybe not all of them? Wait, but if a divides bd, then for each prime in a, it divides either b or d. Therefore, if a prime divides a, it divides b or d. Therefore, if a prime divides a and b, then it divides gcd(a, b). Similarly, if it divides a and d, then it divides gcd(a, d). However, if a prime divides a, but divides neither b nor d, then that's impossible because a divides bd, so every prime in a must divide bd. Therefore, every prime in a divides either b or d. Therefore, for each prime in a, it divides either b or d. Therefore, if we take the product of gcd(a, b) and gcd(a, d), then for each prime in a, it divides either gcd(a, b) or gcd(a, d). Therefore, the product gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) would contain all the primes in a, but with exponents equal to the minimum exponents in a and b or a and d. However, since a divides bd, then for each prime in a, the exponent in a is less than or equal to the exponent in bd. Therefore, the exponents in gcd(a, b) and gcd(a, d) would be the minimum of exponents in a and b, and exponents in a and d. Therefore, the product would have exponents equal to the sum of min(exponents in a and b) + min(exponents in a and d). But since for each prime, it divides either b or d, then either min(exponents in a and b) is the exponent in a, or min(exponents in a and d) is the exponent in a. Therefore, the sum would be equal to the exponent in a. Therefore, the product gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) would have exponents equal to the exponents in a, hence equal to a. Therefore, a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). Therefore, if the problem was gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d), then that would be true. But the problem says gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c). Therefore, maybe there is a typo, or maybe c is related to d?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct as stated, and there's a different approach. Let me think again.

Suppose that a divides bd. Then, we need to show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c). Let me think about the prime factors again. Suppose that a has prime factors p1, p2,..., pn. For each prime pi in a, since a divides bd, then pi divides bd, so pi divides b or pi divides d. Now, gcd(a, b) includes primes that divide both a and b, and gcd(a, c) includes primes that divide both a and c. However, unless c is related to d, I don't see how gcd(a, c) would be connected to the divisibility by a.

Wait, but maybe there's a missing condition? For example, if c is related to d? But the problem as stated doesn't mention c. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem? Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a context where c is another variable, but the original problem is missing some information?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d), and there was a typo. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to find a way to relate c to the given condition.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a different context, such as in a ring or something else? But I think the problem is in integers.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c) given that a divides bd, and there's a relation between c and d? But without more information, it's hard to see.

Wait, maybe the problem is from a specific textbook or context where c is defined in terms of d? For example, maybe c is related to d? But since the problem is presented in isolation, I need to work with what's given.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to think differently. Let me try to approach it algebraically.

Let me denote d1 = gcd(a, b), d2 = gcd(a, c). We need to show that a divides d1*d2.

Alternatively, since d1 divides a and d2 divides a, then d1*d2 divides a^2. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, since a divides bd, then we can write that a divides bd. Let me think about the gcd(a, b). Since d1 divides a and d1 divides b, then d1 divides gcd(a, b). Similarly, d2 divides a and d2 divides c.

But how does that help?

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the property that if a divides bd, then gcd(a, b) divides a and gcd(a, d) divides a. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe think of the problem as follows: Let me write a = gcd(a, b) * k, where k is some integer. Similarly, since gcd(a, b) divides a, then a = gcd(a, b) * k. Then, since a divides bd, then gcd(a, b) * k divides b * d. Therefore, k divides (b * d)/gcd(a, b). But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b) divides a and divides b, then let me write a = gcd(a, b) * m, and b = gcd(a, b) * n, where m and n are coprime. Similarly, since a divides bd, then a divides (gcd(a, b) * n) * d. Therefore, gcd(a, b) * m divides gcd(a, b) * n * d. Therefore, m divides n * d. Since m and n are coprime, m divides d. Therefore, d = m * p for some integer p. Therefore, a = gcd(a, b) * m, and d = m * p. Therefore, then, if we look at gcd(a, c), which is gcd(gcd(a, b)*m, c). But I don't know how c is related to this. Unless c is related to d?

Alternatively, maybe there's a missing condition that c divides d or something? But without that, I don't know.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is supposed to have a different condition. Wait, maybe the problem is in a context where c is another variable, and we need to show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c) given that a divides bd. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a generalization. Suppose that a divides bd, and we want to show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c). Maybe there's a way to use the fact that if a divides bd, then a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). But since the problem says gcd(a, c), maybe there's a connection between c and d?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is mistyped and should be gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). If that's the case, then my previous reasoning would work. But since the problem says gcd(a, c), I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me recall that if a divides bd, then gcd(a, b) divides a and divides b, and gcd(a, d) divides a and divides d. But how does that relate to gcd(a, c)?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if a divides bd, then a divides b * d, so any common divisor of a and b divides a, and any common divisor of a and d divides a. However, if I take the product of gcd(a, b) and gcd(a, c), then unless c is related to d, I don't see how that product would be divisible by a.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to use the fact that if a divides bd, then gcd(a, b) divides a and divides b, and gcd(a, d) divides a and divides d. However, if we have gcd(a, c), then unless c is related to b or d, I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is missing some information. For example, maybe the original problem is in a context where c is a multiple of d or something? But without that, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to think of another way. Let me try to think of specific numbers. Let me take an example.

Let me take a = 6, b = 4, d = 3. Then a divides bd because 6 divides 4*3=12. Now, let me compute gcd(a, b) = gcd(6, 4) = 2, and gcd(a, c). Wait, but what is c? The problem doesn't specify c. So unless c is given, I can't compute it. Therefore, maybe there's a missing part in the problem? Or maybe c is a typo for d?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). Let me check with the example. If a = 6, b = 4, d = 3, then gcd(a, b) = 2, gcd(a, d) = 3, so 2*3 = 6, which is equal to a. Therefore, 6 divides 6, which is true. So that works. If I take another example where a divides bd, say a = 4, b = 2, d = 6. Then a divides 2*6=12. Then gcd(a, b) = 2, gcd(a, d) = 2, so 2*2=4, which is equal to a. So that works. Another example: a = 6, b = 3, d = 4. Then a divides 3*4=12. gcd(a, b) = 3, gcd(a, d) = 2, so 3*2=6, which is a. So that works. So in these cases, if it's gcd(a, b)*gcd(a, d), then it works.

But if I take c instead of d, then in the first example, if c is arbitrary, say c = 5, then gcd(a, c) = gcd(6, 5) = 1, so 2*1 = 2, which does not divide 6. Therefore, in that case, the statement would be false. Therefore, the problem must have a typo, and it should be gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). Therefore, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the correct statement is that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). Therefore, the problem as stated might have a typo.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, but there's another way. Wait, maybe the problem is in a context where c is related to d? For example, if c is a multiple of d or something? But without that, I can't assume.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to think of another approach. Let me try again.

Given that a divides bd, show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c).

Let me think about the prime factors again. Suppose that a has prime factors p1, p2,..., pn. For each prime pi in a, since a divides bd, pi divides bd, so pi divides b or pi divides d. Now, for the gcd(a, b), it includes primes that divide both a and b. Similarly, gcd(a, c) includes primes that divide both a and c. However, unless c is related to b or d, these primes may not overlap. However, the problem says that a divides bd, so for each prime pi in a, it divides b or d. Therefore, if pi divides a and c, then pi divides c. But how does that relate?

Wait, but if pi divides a and c, then pi divides gcd(a, c). However, if pi divides a, but pi divides neither b nor d, then pi divides c? But since a divides bd, pi divides b or d. Therefore, if pi divides a, then pi divides b or d. Therefore, if pi divides c, then pi divides c. However, there's no direct relation between c and b or d unless specified.

Therefore, unless c is related to b or d, I don't see how to connect them. Therefore, maybe the problem is missing a condition, or there is a typo.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to think of a different approach. Let me try using the property that if a divides bd, then gcd(a, b) divides a and gcd(a, d) divides a. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, let me think about the fact that if a divides bd, then gcd(a, b) divides a and divides b, and gcd(a, d) divides a and divides d. Therefore, gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) divides a^2. But we need to show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c). So unless there is a relation between c and d or b, I don't see how.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a ring where c is related to d? Or maybe the problem is from a specific context where c is defined in terms of d? Without more information, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and there's a different way to approach it. Let me try to think of the problem in terms of divisibility.

Let me suppose that a divides bd. Then, there exists an integer k such that bd = a * k. Now, I need to show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c). Let me denote d1 = gcd(a, b), d2 = gcd(a, c). Then, I need to show that a divides d1 * d2.

Since d1 divides a and d2 divides a, then d1 * d2 divides a^2. However, this doesn't directly help. But since a divides bd, maybe I can find some relation between d1 * d2 and a.

Alternatively, let me note that d1 divides a and d1 divides b. Similarly, d2 divides a and d2 divides c. Therefore, d1 * d2 divides a * c. But since a divides bd, then a divides bd, so maybe there's a way to connect this?

Alternatively, since a divides bd, then a divides b * d. Therefore, if I can show that d2 divides b * d, then since d1 divides a and d2 divides a, then d1 * d2 divides a^2, but I need a to divide d1 * d2. This seems conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the fact that if a divides bd, then gcd(a, b) divides a and gcd(a, d) divides a. But again, not helpful.

Wait, maybe the problem is correct, and there's a different approach. Let me think of the problem as follows: since a divides bd, then any common divisor of a and b must divide a, and any common divisor of a and c must divide a. But how does that help?

Alternatively, maybe think of the problem in terms of the prime factors. Suppose that a has a prime factor p. Then, since a divides bd, p divides b or p divides d. Now, if p divides gcd(a, b), then p divides b. Similarly, if p divides gcd(a, c), then p divides c. However, since p divides a, which divides bd, then p divides b or d. But if p divides c, then it's not necessarily related to b or d. Therefore, unless c is related to b or d, this doesn't help.

But the problem says that a divides bd, so for each prime in a, it divides b or d. Therefore, if a prime divides gcd(a, b), it divides b. If a prime divides gcd(a, c), it divides c. However, since a divides bd, if a prime divides a, it divides b or d. Therefore, if a prime divides both a and c, then it divides c, but since it divides a, it must divide b or d. Therefore, if a prime divides both a and c, it divides c and divides b or d. Therefore, if I take the product of gcd(a, b) and gcd(a, c), then for each prime in a, it is either in gcd(a, b) or in gcd(a, c). Wait, but how?

Wait, suppose that a prime p divides a. Then, p divides b or d. Now, if p divides gcd(a, b), then p divides b. If p divides gcd(a, c), then p divides c. But since p divides a, and a divides bd, then p divides b or d. If p divides c, then it's possible that p divides c and also divides b or d. However, unless c is related to b or d, I don't know.

But maybe the problem is that the product gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c) contains all the primes in a? No, because if a prime p divides a, it divides b or d. If it divides b, then it's in gcd(a, b). If it divides d, then it's not necessarily in gcd(a, c). Therefore, unless c is related to d, it's not necessarily in gcd(a, c). Therefore, the product might not contain all primes in a. Therefore, the product might not be divisible by a.

Therefore, this suggests that the problem as stated is incorrect, or there is a missing condition. Given that, maybe the original problem had a typo, and it should be gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). In that case, the reasoning would work as I did earlier.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and there's a different approach. Let me try to think of it as follows.

Since a divides bd, then a divides b * d. Let me write this as b * d = a * k for some integer k. Now, let me consider the gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c). Let me denote d1 = gcd(a, b), d2 = gcd(a, c). I need to show that a divides d1 * d2.

Since d1 divides a and d2 divides a, then d1 * d2 divides a^2. But how does that relate to a dividing d1 * d2? It would require that d1 * d2 is a multiple of a, i.e., that a divides d1 * d2. But how to show that?

Alternatively, since d1 divides a, let me write a = d1 * m, where m is an integer. Similarly, since d2 divides a, let me write a = d2 * n, where n is an integer. Therefore, d1 * d2 = a * m * n / (d1 * d2) ? Wait, no, this seems messy.

Alternatively, since d1 divides a, then a = d1 * m. Similarly, since d2 divides a, a = d2 * n. Therefore, d1 * d2 divides a^2. But I need a to divide d1 * d2. So, if a divides d1 * d2, then d1 * d2 = a * k for some integer k. But since a = d1 * m, then d1 * d2 = d1 * m * k => d2 = m * k. But since d2 divides a = d1 * m, then d2 divides d1 * m. But since d1 and d2 are both divisors of a, and d1 and d2 are gcds, they might not be coprime. This seems too vague.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the fact that if a divides bd, then gcd(a, b) divides a and gcd(a, d) divides a, and then use some property of gcds. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe think of the problem as follows: since a divides bd, then the gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) divides a^2, but also, since a divides bd, then gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) is a multiple of a? No, in my previous example with a = 6, b = 4, d = 3, gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) = 2 * 3 = 6 = a. So that works. If I take a = 4, b = 2, d = 6, then gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) = 2 * 2 = 4 = a. If I take a = 6, b = 3, d = 4, then gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) = 3 * 2 = 6 = a. So in all these cases, it works. So maybe the correct statement is that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d), and the problem has a typo with c instead of d. Therefore, assuming that, then the problem is correct.

Therefore, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the correct statement is that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). Therefore, given that, I can proceed to prove it.

So, assuming that the problem should be gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d), then let me try to prove it.

Let me recall that if a divides bd, then gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) is divisible by a.

To prove this, let me use the property that for any integers x, y, z, gcd(x, y) * gcd(x, z) divides x * gcd(y, z). But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me use the fact that gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) divides a * gcd(b, d). But since a divides bd, then gcd(b, d) is some divisor of bd. Not sure.

Alternatively, let me use the prime factorization approach. Let me write a as a product of primes, say a = p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ... * pn^en.

For each prime pi in a, since a divides bd, pi divides bd, so pi divides b or pi divides d. Now, gcd(a, b) includes pi^{min(ei, f_i)}, where fi is the exponent of pi in b. Similarly, gcd(a, d) includes pi^{min(ei, g_i)}, where gi is the exponent of pi in d.

Therefore, the product gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) includes pi^{min(ei, fi) + min(ei, gi)}. Since pi divides b or d, either fi >= ei or gi >= ei. Therefore, min(ei, fi) + min(ei, gi) = ei + min(0, fi - ei) + min(0, gi - ei). Wait, no. Wait, if pi divides b, then fi >= 1, but since a divides bd, pi divides b or d. So, if pi divides b, then fi >= ei (since a has pi^ei, and pi divides b, so fi >= ei? No, that's not necessarily true. Wait, if pi divides a, then pi divides b or d. But the exponent of pi in b could be less than ei, or greater than or equal to ei.

Wait, let me think. If a divides bd, then for each prime pi in a, the exponent of pi in bd is at least the exponent in a. So, if pi divides a, then in bd, the exponent of pi is at least ei. Therefore, if pi divides b, then the exponent of pi in b is at least ei? No, not necessarily. For example, a = 4 = 2^2, b = 2, d = 2. Then a divides bd = 4, and the exponent of 2 in b is 1, which is less than 2. But since pi divides b or d, in this case, pi divides both b and d. So, in general, for each prime pi in a, the exponent in b + exponent in d >= ei.

Therefore, for each prime pi in a, either the exponent in b is >= ei or the exponent in d is >= ei, or both. Therefore, in the product gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d), the exponent of pi is min(ei, exponent in b) + min(ei, exponent in d). Let me denote f = exponent of pi in b, g = exponent of pi in d. Then, f + g >= ei.

Now, min(ei, f) + min(ei, g). Let me analyze this.

Case 1: f >= ei and g >= ei. Then min(ei, f) = ei, min(ei, g) = ei. So total is ei + ei = 2ei.

Case 2: f >= ei, g < ei. Then min(ei, f) = ei, min(ei, g) = g. Total is ei + g.

But since f + g >= ei, and g < ei, then f >= ei - g. But since g < ei, ei - g > 0. But f >= ei - g, but since f >= ei, this is redundant. However, the total is ei + g. But since f + g >= ei, then g >= ei - f. But since f >= ei, ei - f <= 0, so g >= something negative, which is always true. But how does this relate to ei?

Actually, in this case, since f >= ei, and g < ei, then ei + g could be less than 2ei or more? Wait, no, since g < ei, ei + g < ei + ei = 2ei. But we need to see if this is >= ei. Well, since f + g >= ei, and f >= ei, then g >= ei - f. But since f >= ei, ei - f <= 0, so g >= something negative, which is always true. But this doesn't help.

But in this case, the exponent in the product is ei + g. Since g < ei, then ei + g < 2ei. But how does this relate to the exponent in a, which is ei? Well, we need to show that the exponent in the product is at least ei. But in this case, ei + g. Since g >= 0, then ei + g >= ei. Therefore, in this case, the exponent is at least ei.

Similarly, if g >= ei and f < ei, then the exponent is ei + f >= ei.

Case 3: f < ei and g < ei. Then, f + g >= ei. But since both f and g are less than ei, their sum is at least ei. So, min(ei, f) + min(ei, g) = f + g >= ei. Therefore, the exponent in the product is f + g >= ei.

Therefore, in all cases, the exponent of pi in the product gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) is at least ei, which means that the product is divisible by a. Therefore, a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d).

Therefore, if the problem had c instead of d, it would be a typo. But since the problem says c, maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the user made a mistake in writing it, or maybe there is a specific context where c is related to d. But without more information, I can't proceed.

However, given that in the problem statement, if we assume that it's supposed to be gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d), then the proof is as above. Therefore, I think that there is likely a typo, and the correct statement is with d instead of c.

Alternatively, maybe the original problem is correct, and I need to think of another way. Let me try to think of it as follows: since a divides bd, then a divides b * d. Therefore, any common divisor of a and b divides a, and any common divisor of a and c divides a. But how does that help?

Alternatively, since a divides bd, then the gcd(a, b) divides a, and since a divides bd, then the gcd(a, b) divides b. Therefore, gcd(a, b) divides gcd(a, b). Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that if a divides bd, then gcd(a, b) divides a and gcd(a, d) divides a. Therefore, gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) is a multiple of gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d), but I need to show that a divides this product.

But since a divides bd, and gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) is a multiple of a, as shown in the previous example, then maybe that's the case. But how to show it generally?

Alternatively, since a divides bd, then the product gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) is equal to gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). But how to relate this to a?

Alternatively, use the identity that gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) = gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). But I don't know.

Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) = gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). Since a divides bd, then this product is equal to a * something. But I need to show that.

Alternatively, use the formula that gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) = gcd(a, b, d) * something? Not sure.

Alternatively, think of the problem as follows: since a divides bd, then the gcd(a, b) divides a and divides b, and gcd(a, d) divides a and divides d. Therefore, the product gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) divides a^2. But we need to show that a divides this product. So, if we can show that the product is a multiple of a, then it's done. Which would mean that the product is a multiple of a, i.e., that the product is at least a. But this is not necessarily true. For example, take a = 6, b = 2, d = 3. Then gcd(a, b) = 2, gcd(a, d) = 3, product is 6, which is equal to a. Another example, a = 4, b = 2, d = 6. gcd(a, b) = 2, gcd(a, d) = 2, product is 4, equal to a. Another example, a = 6, b = 3, d = 4. gcd(a, b) = 3, gcd(a, d) = 2, product is 6, equal to a. But if I take a = 6, b = 2, d = 2. Then gcd(a, b) = 2, gcd(a, d) = 2, product is 4, which is less than a. Wait, but in this case, a = 6 divides bd = 2*2 = 4? No, 6 does not divide 4. Therefore, this is not a valid example. So, in cases where a divides bd, the product gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d) is equal to a. Wait, in the example where a = 6, b = 2, d = 3, which is valid because 6 divides 2*3 = 6. The product is 2*3 = 6 = a. If I take a = 6, b = 2, d = 6, then a divides bd = 2*6 = 12. Then gcd(a, b) = 2, gcd(a, d) = 6, product is 12, which is 2*a. So, it's a multiple of a. Similarly, if a = 6, b = 4, d = 3, then product is 2*3 = 6 = a. If a = 6, b = 4, d = 6, then product is 2*6 = 12 = 2*a. So, in general, it seems that the product is a multiple of a. Therefore, a divides the product.

Therefore, the statement is true if it's gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). Therefore, I think there is a typo in the problem, and the correct statement is with d instead of c. Therefore, assuming that, the proof is as above.

Therefore, given that, I think the original problem likely had a typo, and the correct statement is to show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). Therefore, the answer is that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d), and the original problem likely had a typo.

But since the problem says gcd(a, c), and assuming that it's correct, then I might have to conclude that there is an error in the problem statement. However, since the user is asking for a solution, and given that in the context of the problem, it's possible that the user meant gcd(a, d), I will proceed under that assumption and provide the proof for that case, noting the possible typo.

Therefore, the final answer is that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d), which is the corrected statement.

But since the original problem says gcd(a, c), and if we must answer based on that, then perhaps there's another way. However, given the lack of information, I think the most plausible conclusion is that there is a typo, and the correct statement involves gcd(a, d). Therefore, the answer is that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d), and the original problem likely had a typo.

However, since the user might have intended a different approach, and given that the problem is as stated, I need to check once more.

Wait, maybe the problem is correct, and the key is that a divides bd, so we can write that a divides b * d, and then since we need to show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c), maybe there's a way to relate c to b and d.

But unless c is related to d, I don't see how. Maybe c is a typo for d, or maybe there's a missing condition.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c) given that a divides bd, and c is arbitrary. But in that case, the statement is not generally true, as shown in the example where a = 6, b = 4, d = 3, c = 5, then gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, c) = 2 * 1 = 2, which does not divide 6. Therefore, the statement is false in this case, so the problem must have a typo.

Therefore, I think the correct statement is with d instead of c, and the answer is that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{a} divides the product, but since the problem asks to show that a divides the product, the answer is that it is true, and the boxed answer would be \boxed{a} divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). But since the problem says gcd(a, c), I'm not sure.

But given the original problem as stated, it's likely that there is a typo, and the correct answer is that a divides gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, d). Therefore, I will proceed with that.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{a}
</think>

To prove the statement:

> **If** $ a \mid bd $, **then** $ a \mid \gcd(a, b) \cdot \gcd(a, c) $,

we must analyze the relationship between the divisibility of $ a $ and the product $ bd $, and how that relates to the greatest common divisors (gcd) of $ a $ with $ b $ and $ c $.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Given Condition

The condition $ a \mid bd $ means that $ a $ divides the product $ bd $. In other words, there exists some integer $ k $ such that:

$$
bd = ak
$$

This tells us that all prime factors of $ a $ must appear in either $ b $ or $ d $, or both.

---

### Step 2: Understanding the Target Statement

We are to show that:

$$
a \mid \gcd(a, b) \cdot \gcd(a, c)
$$

Let us denote:

- $ d_1 = \gcd(a, b) $
- $ d_2 = \gcd(a, c) $

So we want to show that $ a \mid d_1 \cdot d_2 $.

---

### Step 3: Analyzing the Structure of $ \gcd(a, b) $ and $ \gcd(a, c) $

We know that:

- $ d_1 = \gcd(a, b) $ divides both $ a $ and $ b $, so it divides $ a $.
- $ d_2 = \gcd(a, c) $ divides both $ a $ and $ c $, so it also divides $ a $.

Therefore, $ d_1 \cdot d_2 $ divides $ a^2 $, but we need to show that it is divisible by $ a $, i.e., that $ a \mid d_1 \cdot d_2 $.

However, this is **not** necessarily true unless $ c $ is related to $ b $ or $ d $ in some way.

---

### Step 4: Re-evaluating the Problem

Let’s examine the logic of the original problem again. The statement is:

> If $ a \mid bd $, then $ a \mid \gcd(a, b) \cdot \gcd(a, c) $

This is **not** generally true unless there is a specific relationship between $ c $ and $ b $ or $ d $. In fact, as a counterexample:

- Let $ a = 6 $, $ b = 4 $, $ d = 3 $, and $ c = 5 $
- Then $ a \mid bd = 4 \cdot 3 = 12 $
- $ \gcd(a, b) = \gcd(6, 4) = 2 $
- $ \gcd(a, c) = \gcd(6, 5) = 1 $
- So $ \gcd(a, b) \cdot \gcd(a, c) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 $
- But $ a = 6 $ does **not** divide 2.

This shows that the original statement is **false** as written.

---

### Step 5: Correcting the Problem

A plausible correction is that the intended statement is:

> **If** $ a \mid bd $, **then** $ a \mid \gcd(a, b) \cdot \gcd(a, d) $

This is a well-known identity in number theory. We can prove it using the prime factorization approach or by using the property that:

- If $ a \mid bd $, then for every prime $ p $ dividing $ a $, it divides $ b $ or $ d $.
- Therefore, for each prime $ p $ dividing $ a $, it will divide $ \gcd(a, b) $ or $ \gcd(a, d) $, and thus will appear in the product $ \gcd(a, b) \cdot \gcd(a, d) $.
- Therefore, the product $ \gcd(a, b) \cdot \gcd(a, d) $ contains all the prime factors of $ a $, with exponents at least as large as those in $ a $, hence $ a \mid \gcd(a, b) \cdot \gcd(a, d) $.

---

### Final Conclusion

The original problem as stated is **not** generally true. However, if we correct the statement to involve $ \gcd(a, d) $ instead of $ \gcd(a, c) $, the result is valid. Based on the most likely intended meaning, the correct statement is:

> **If** $ a \mid bd $, **then** $ a \mid \gcd(a, b) \cdot \gcd(a, d) $

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{a}
