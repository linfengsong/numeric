Okay, so I need to prove that if a and b are relatively prime positive integers, then the Diophantine equation ax - by = c has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a Diophantine equation is. It's an equation where we're looking for integer solutions. In this case, specifically positive integers. 

First, since a and b are coprime, their greatest common divisor is 1. That probably plays a key role here. The equation is ax - by = c. So, we need to find positive integers x and y such that this equation holds. The question says there are infinitely many solutions. 

Let me think. For linear Diophantine equations, I remember that there's a theorem that says that ax + by = c has solutions if and only if gcd(a, b) divides c. Since here, a and b are coprime, gcd(a, b) is 1, so 1 divides c, which it always does. Therefore, there are solutions in integers. But the question is about positive integer solutions, and specifically infinitely many of them. 

So, maybe I need to find a particular solution first and then show that there are infinitely many solutions by varying some parameter. Let me recall that once you have one solution, you can generate all solutions by adding multiples of b to x and subtracting multiples of a from y, or something like that. Wait, the general solution for ax + by = c is x = x0 + (b/d)t, y = y0 - (a/d)t, where d is gcd(a, b), and t is an integer. Since here d = 1, it would be x = x0 + bt, y = y0 - at. But in our case, the equation is ax - by = c, so maybe I need to rearrange it. Let me write it as ax + (-b)y = c. So, similar to the standard form. 

Therefore, the general solution would be x = x0 + (-b)t, y = y0 + (-a)t? Wait, no, maybe I need to think again. Let me recall the general solution for ax + by = c. If (x0, y0) is a particular solution, then all solutions are given by x = x0 + (b/d)t, y = y0 - (a/d)t, where t is an integer. Since d = 1 here, it's x = x0 + bt, y = y0 - at. 

But in our case, the equation is ax - by = c. So, if we consider variables x and y, then it's equivalent to ax + (-b)y = c. So, the general solution would be x = x0 + (-b)t, y = y0 + (-a)t? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check. 

Suppose we have ax + by = c. Then the general solution is x = x0 + (b/d)t, y = y0 - (a/d)t. So, for our equation ax - by = c, which is ax + (-b)y = c, so here, the coefficients are a and -b. Therefore, the general solution would be x = x0 + (-b)/d * t, y = y0 + a/d * t? Wait, no, maybe I need to think about the standard method. 

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as solving for x and y. Let me try to find a particular solution first. Since a and b are coprime, there exist integers x0 and y0 such that ax0 - by0 = c. But since we need positive integers, maybe we need to find such x0 and y0 where x0 and y0 are positive? Or maybe not necessarily, but then we can adjust them. 

But the problem says that there are infinitely many solutions in positive integers. So, even if the initial solution is not in positive integers, we can find some solutions that are. But how do we ensure that there are infinitely many?

Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize the solutions. Let me try to think. Suppose we fix x and solve for y. Then, ax - by = c => by = ax - c => y = (ax - c)/b. For y to be a positive integer, ax - c must be divisible by b and the result must be positive. Similarly, if we fix y, then x = (by + c)/a, which must be a positive integer. 

But since a and b are coprime, maybe we can find x such that ax ≡ c mod b. Since a and b are coprime, a has an inverse modulo b. Therefore, there exists an integer x such that ax ≡ c mod b. Let me write that as x ≡ c * a^{-1} mod b. So, the solutions for x are of the form x = x0 + bt, where x0 is some particular solution. Then, substituting back into the equation, we can find y. 

So, if I take x = x0 + bt, then y = (a(x0 + bt) - c)/b = (ax0 - c)/b + at. Since ax0 - c must be divisible by b, because x0 was chosen such that ax0 ≡ c mod b. Therefore, (ax0 - c)/b is an integer. Let me call that y0. Therefore, the general solution is x = x0 + bt, y = y0 + at. 

Therefore, all solutions are given by x = x0 + bt, y = y0 + at for integers t. Now, we need to find t such that x and y are positive integers. 

So, if we can find t such that x0 + bt > 0 and y0 + at > 0, then we have solutions. Since we need infinitely many solutions, we need to find infinitely many t where both x and y are positive. 

But how do we ensure that? Let me think. Suppose that x0 and y0 are particular solutions. But maybe they are not positive. However, since we can choose t appropriately, perhaps for large enough t, both x and y will be positive. 

Wait, but if we take t to be positive, then x increases as t increases, and y increases as t increases. Therefore, if for some t, both x and y are positive, then for all larger t, they will be positive as well. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions. 

But wait, but what if the initial solution (x0, y0) is not positive? For example, suppose that x0 is negative and y0 is negative. Then, if we take t positive, x = x0 + bt, y = y0 + at. If we choose t large enough, then x and y will become positive. Similarly, if one of them is negative and the other is positive, then we can choose t such that both become positive. 

But how do we know that there exists such t? Well, since a and b are positive integers, and t is an integer. So, suppose that x0 + bt > 0 and y0 + at > 0. Let me think of t as a parameter. For x to be positive, t > -x0 / b. For y to be positive, t > -y0 / a. Therefore, if we take t to be greater than the maximum of (-x0 / b, -y0 / a), then both x and y will be positive. Since t is an integer, we can choose t to be sufficiently large. Therefore, there are infinitely many t such that x and y are positive. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions. 

But wait, but how do we know that there exists at least one t such that x and y are positive? Because if the original solution (x0, y0) is not positive, but we can adjust t to make them positive. But how do we know that such t exists?

Alternatively, maybe we can find a particular solution where x and y are positive. Let me think. Since the equation ax - by = c has solutions in integers, and since a and b are positive, we can find solutions where x and y are positive. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that since a and b are coprime, we can find integers x and y such that ax - by = c. Then, by adjusting t, we can find infinitely many solutions. 

But maybe I need to formalize this. Let me try to find a particular solution. Let me recall that since a and b are coprime, there exist integers x', y' such that ax' - by' = c. But how do I know that such x' and y' exist? Well, because ax + by = c has solutions for any c, since gcd(a, b) = 1. Wait, but here it's ax - by = c. So, if we think of it as ax + (-b)y = c, then since gcd(a, -b) = gcd(a, b) = 1, so yes, there are solutions. 

So, there exists integers x', y' such that ax' - by' = c. Now, if I can find such x' and y' where x' and y' are positive, then I can use the general solution. But if not, then maybe I can adjust t to make them positive. 

Alternatively, maybe I can find a solution where x is positive and y is positive. Let me think. Suppose that I have a solution (x', y'). If x' is positive and y' is positive, then we can take t = 0, and that's a solution. If not, then perhaps we can adjust t. 

But perhaps there's a better way. Let me think. Since a and b are positive, and we need x and y to be positive. Let me suppose that we have a solution (x0, y0). If x0 is positive and y0 is positive, then we can take t = 0. If x0 is negative, then we can take t such that x0 + bt is positive. Similarly for y0. 

But how do I know that there exists t such that both x0 + bt and y0 + at are positive? Well, since a and b are positive, as t increases, x increases and y increases. Therefore, if we take t large enough, both x and y will be positive. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions. 

But to make this precise, let's suppose that we have a particular solution (x0, y0). Let me assume that x0 and y0 are integers (which they are). Now, if x0 and y0 are both positive, then we can take t = 0, which gives a solution. Then, for any t ≥ 0, x = x0 + bt and y = y0 + at will also be positive. Therefore, infinitely many solutions. 

But if x0 is negative, then for t large enough, x0 + bt will be positive. Similarly, if y0 is negative, then for t large enough, y0 + at will be positive. However, we need to ensure that both x and y are positive. So, suppose that x0 is negative and y0 is positive. Then, we need to find t such that x0 + bt > 0 and y0 + at > 0. Since a and b are positive, as t increases, x increases and y increases. Therefore, there exists some t such that both are positive. Similarly, if both x0 and y0 are negative, then for t large enough, both will be positive. 

Therefore, regardless of the initial solution, there exists a t such that x and y are positive, and since t can be any integer greater than some value, there are infinitely many solutions. 

But how do I know that there is at least one such t? Let me think. Suppose that x0 is negative. Then, solving x0 + bt > 0 gives t > -x0 / b. Similarly, if y0 is negative, then t > -y0 / a. Therefore, if I take t to be the ceiling of the maximum of (-x0 / b, -y0 / a), then both x and y will be positive. Therefore, there exists at least one t. 

Therefore, once we have a particular solution, we can find t such that x and y are positive, and since t can be increased indefinitely, there are infinitely many solutions. 

But how do I know that there is at least one particular solution with x and y positive? Well, since the equation has solutions in integers, and since we can adjust t to make x and y positive, but maybe there's a case where even after adjusting t, x and y can't be positive? 

Wait, no. Because if we have a particular solution (x0, y0), then by choosing t large enough, we can make x and y positive. Therefore, there is at least one solution. Then, since t can be increased indefinitely, there are infinitely many solutions. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are infinitely many solutions in positive integers. 

But let me check with an example. Let me take a = 2, b = 3, which are coprime. Let me pick c = 1. Then, the equation is 2x - 3y = 1. Let's find solutions. 

First, find a particular solution. Let me try small numbers. Let me try y = 1: 2x - 3(1) = 1 => 2x = 4 => x = 2. So (2, 1) is a solution. Then, the general solution is x = 2 + 3t, y = 1 + 2t. Now, for t = 0, we have (2, 1). For t = 1, (5, 3). For t = 2, (8, 5), etc. All positive. 

Alternatively, if we had a different c. Let me take c = 2. Then 2x - 3y = 2. Let me find a solution. Let me try y = 0: 2x = 2 => x = 1. But y must be positive. So y = 0 is not allowed. Let me try y = 1: 2x - 3 = 2 => 2x = 5 => x = 2.5, not integer. y = 2: 2x - 6 = 2 => 2x = 8 => x = 4. So (4, 2) is a solution. Then general solution x = 4 + 3t, y = 2 + 2t. For t = 0: (4, 2). For t = 1: (7, 4), etc. All positive. 

But suppose that the initial solution is negative. Let me take c = -1. Wait, but c is supposed to be a positive integer? Wait, the problem says "positive integers" for x and y, but c is just given as a constant. Wait, the problem says "the Diophantine equation ax - by = c has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers." So, c is given, but the problem says "a and b are relatively prime positive integers", but c is not specified. Wait, but in the problem statement, is c a given positive integer? Wait, the problem says "the Diophantine equation ax - by = c has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers." So, c is fixed. But the problem didn't specify that c is positive. Wait, but the equation ax - by = c. If c is negative, then maybe there are solutions? But the problem says "in the positive integers", so x and y must be positive. 

Wait, but the problem says "prove that the Diophantine equation ax - by = c has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers." So, c is given. But since a and b are positive integers, and x and y are positive integers, then ax - by = c. If c is negative, then ax - by = c would require that ax is less than by, but since x and y are positive, maybe there are solutions. However, the problem says "relatively prime positive integers", but doesn't specify c. Wait, but the problem must be assuming that c is a positive integer? Or is it possible that c is arbitrary? 

Wait, the problem says "the Diophantine equation ax - by = c has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers." So, given that a and b are coprime positive integers, and c is some integer. But the problem is to prove that there are infinitely many solutions in positive integers. However, if c is not a multiple of gcd(a, b), which is 1, so it's always possible. But if c is negative, then maybe there are solutions. But the problem says "positive integers", so x and y must be positive. 

But the problem didn't specify that c is positive. Wait, but the problem says "the Diophantine equation ax - by = c has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers." So, perhaps c is given, but we need to assume that there exists at least one solution? Wait, but the problem says "prove that... has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers." So, maybe c is such that there are solutions. But the problem says "a and b are relatively prime positive integers", so maybe c is arbitrary? But the problem is to prove that regardless of c, there are infinitely many solutions? Or is there a condition on c? 

Wait, but the original problem says "the Diophantine equation ax - by = c has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers." So, given that a and b are coprime positive integers, and c is some integer. But if c is arbitrary, then for some c, there may not be any solutions. For example, if c is negative and a and b are positive, but x and y are positive. Let me check. Suppose c is negative. For example, take a = 2, b = 3, c = -1. Then, 2x - 3y = -1. Let me try to find positive integers x and y. Let me rearrange: 2x + 1 = 3y. Therefore, 3y must be 2x + 1. Since 2x + 1 is odd, y must be such that 3y is odd, so y must be odd. Let me try y = 1: 3(1) = 3 = 2x + 1 => 2x = 2 => x = 1. So (1, 1) is a solution. Then, general solution? Let me think. The equation is 2x - 3y = -1. So, rearranged as 2x + 1 = 3y. So, the general solution would be... Let me think. If (x, y) is a solution, then adding multiples of 3 to x and multiples of 2 to y? Wait, the general solution for ax + by = c. Wait, in this case, the equation is 2x - 3y = -1. So, if we have a particular solution (x0, y0) = (1, 1), then the general solution is x = x0 + 3t, y = y0 + 2t. Wait, because the coefficients are 2 and -3. So, the homogeneous equation is 2x - 3y = 0. The solutions to the homogeneous equation are x = 3t, y = 2t. Therefore, the general solution is x = 1 + 3t, y = 1 + 2t. 

Therefore, for t = 0: (1, 1). For t = 1: (4, 3). For t = 2: (7, 5), etc. All positive integers. Therefore, even if c is negative, there are infinitely many solutions. 

So, regardless of c, as long as a and b are coprime, there are solutions. Therefore, the problem is to prove that there are infinitely many solutions in positive integers. 

Therefore, the key idea is that once you have a particular solution (x0, y0), you can generate infinitely many solutions by adding multiples of b to x and multiples of a to y. But since a and b are positive, increasing t will make x and y larger, hence positive. Therefore, as long as there exists at least one solution, there are infinitely many. 

But how do we know that there is at least one solution? Well, since a and b are coprime, the equation ax - by = c has solutions in integers. Therefore, there exists integers x and y such that ax - by = c. Then, as we saw, by choosing t sufficiently large, we can make x and y positive. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are infinitely many solutions. 

But let me check another example. Let me take a = 3, b = 5, c = 7. Then, 3x - 5y = 7. Let me find a solution. Let me try y = 1: 3x - 5 = 7 => 3x = 12 => x = 4. So (4, 1) is a solution. Then general solution is x = 4 + 5t, y = 1 + 3t. For t = 0: (4, 1). For t = 1: (9, 4). For t = 2: (14, 7), etc. All positive. 

Another example with c = 1. Let me take a = 3, b = 5, c = 1. Then 3x - 5y = 1. Let me find a solution. Let me try y = 2: 3x - 10 = 1 => 3x = 11 => nope. y = 1: 3x - 5 = 1 => 3x = 6 => x = 2. So (2, 1) is a solution. Then general solution x = 2 + 5t, y = 1 + 3t. For t = 0: (2, 1). For t = 1: (7, 4). For t = 2: (12, 7), etc. All positive. 

So, seems like in all these cases, there are infinitely many solutions. 

But let me think of a case where maybe the initial solution is not positive, but after adjusting t, we can get positive solutions. Let me take a = 2, b = 3, c = 5. Then, 2x - 3y = 5. Let me find a solution. Let me try y = 1: 2x - 3 = 5 => 2x = 8 => x = 4. So (4, 1) is a solution. General solution x = 4 + 3t, y = 1 + 2t. So, for t = 0, 1, 2,... all positive. 

Alternatively, suppose I take a solution where x is negative. Let me take a = 2, b = 3, c = -1. Then 2x - 3y = -1. As before, (1, 1) is a solution. But suppose I take another solution. Let me take t = -1: x = 1 - 3 = -2, y = 1 - 2 = -1. So (-2, -1) is a solution. But if I take t = -1, then x and y are negative. However, if I take t = 1, then x = 4, y = 3. So, even though there is a solution with negative numbers, there are solutions with positive numbers. 

Therefore, the key point is that even if there are solutions with negative numbers, there are solutions with positive numbers, and infinitely many. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that since there exists at least one solution (due to the equation having solutions in integers), and we can generate infinitely many solutions by increasing t, which makes x and y positive. 

Therefore, the proof would be:

1. Since a and b are coprime, the equation ax - by = c has integer solutions.

2. Let (x0, y0) be a particular solution in integers.

3. The general solution is x = x0 + bt, y = y0 + at for integer t.

4. Since a and b are positive, for sufficiently large t, both x and y will be positive.

5. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions in positive integers.

But to make this rigorous, we need to ensure that there exists some t such that x and y are positive, and then that for all t beyond that, they remain positive. 

Alternatively, since the general solution is x = x0 + bt and y = y0 + at, we can find t such that x0 + bt > 0 and y0 + at > 0. 

Let me formalize this. Suppose that x0 and y0 are integers such that ax0 - by0 = c. 

Case 1: x0 > 0 and y0 > 0. Then, take t = 0, which gives a solution. Then, for any t ≥ 0, x = x0 + bt > x0 > 0 and y = y0 + at > y0 > 0. Therefore, infinitely many solutions.

Case 2: x0 ≤ 0 and y0 ≤ 0. Then, we need to find t such that x0 + bt > 0 and y0 + at > 0. Since b and a are positive, as t increases, x and y increase. Therefore, there exists some t such that both are positive. For example, take t such that t > -x0 / b and t > -y0 / a. Let t be the maximum of ceil(-x0 / b + 1) and ceil(-y0 / a + 1). Then, for t ≥ that value, x and y are positive. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions.

Case 3: One of x0 or y0 is positive, and the other is negative. Suppose x0 > 0 and y0 < 0. Then, we need to find t such that y0 + at > 0. Since a is positive, solving for t: t > -y0 / a. Since y0 is negative, -y0 is positive, so t > some positive number. Then, for t ≥ that value, y becomes positive. Also, since x = x0 + bt, which is already positive when t ≥ 0. Therefore, taking t ≥ max(0, ceil(-y0 / a + 1)), we have both x and y positive. Similarly for the other case.

Therefore, regardless of the initial solution, there exists a t such that x and y are positive, and since t can be increased indefinitely, there are infinitely many solutions.

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are infinitely many positive integer solutions.

Hence, the proof is complete.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\text{There are infinitely many solutions in positive integers.}}
</think>

To prove that the Diophantine equation  
$$
ax - by = c
$$  
has **infinitely many solutions in the positive integers**, given that $ a $ and $ b $ are relatively prime positive integers, we proceed through a structured logical argument based on the properties of linear Diophantine equations and the nature of the solutions.

---

### Step 1: Existence of Integer Solutions

Since $ a $ and $ b $ are relatively prime, their greatest common divisor is 1, i.e., $ \gcd(a, b) = 1 $. This implies that the equation  
$$
ax - by = c
$$  
has **integer solutions** for any integer $ c $, by the **Linear Diophantine Equation Theorem**. That is, there exist integers $ x_0 $ and $ y_0 $ such that  
$$
ax_0 - by_0 = c.
$$

---

### Step 2: General Form of the Solution

Once a particular solution $ (x_0, y_0) $ is found, the **general solution** to the equation can be written as:
$$
x = x_0 + bt, \quad y = y_0 + at,
$$
for all integers $ t $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are the coefficients of $ x $ and $ y $, respectively.

This is because the homogeneous equation $ ax - by = 0 $ has solutions of the form $ x = bt $, $ y = at $, and thus the general solution is obtained by adding such solutions to a particular solution.

---

### Step 3: Ensuring Positive Integer Solutions

We now want to determine whether there are **infinitely many positive integer solutions**. That is, we want $ x > 0 $ and $ y > 0 $ for infinitely many values of $ t $.

Let’s define:
- $ x = x_0 + bt $
- $ y = y_0 + at $

Since $ a $ and $ b $ are positive, increasing $ t $ increases both $ x $ and $ y $. Therefore, for sufficiently large $ t $, both $ x $ and $ y $ will be positive.

To formalize this:

- If $ x_0 > 0 $ and $ y_0 > 0 $, then $ t = 0 $ gives a valid solution, and all $ t \geq 0 $ yield positive $ x $ and $ y $.
- If $ x_0 \leq 0 $, then for sufficiently large $ t $, $ x = x_0 + bt > 0 $.
- Similarly, if $ y_0 \leq 0 $, then for sufficiently large $ t $, $ y = y_0 + at > 0 $.

Therefore, **there exists some integer $ t_0 $** such that for all $ t \geq t_0 $, both $ x $ and $ y $ are positive.

---

### Step 4: Infinitely Many Positive Solutions

Since the general solution is:
$$
x = x_0 + bt, \quad y = y_0 + at,
$$
and for each $ t \in \mathbb{Z} $, this gives a unique solution, and we have shown that **for infinitely many values of $ t $**, both $ x $ and $ y $ are positive, it follows that **there are infinitely many positive integer solutions**.

---

### Final Conclusion

Hence, we have shown that for any relatively prime positive integers $ a $ and $ b $, the equation  
$$
ax - by = c
$$  
has **infinitely many solutions in the positive integers**.

$$
\boxed{\text{There are infinitely many solutions in positive integers.}}
$$
