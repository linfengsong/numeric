Okay, so I need to prove that the difference between two consecutive cubes is never divisible by 2. Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. 

First, let me recall what consecutive cubes are. If I take two consecutive integers, say n and n+1, their cubes would be n³ and (n+1)³. The difference between them would be (n+1)³ - n³. The question is asking whether this difference is ever divisible by 2. And the claim is that it's never divisible by 2. So I need to show that (n+1)³ - n³ is always odd, meaning it's not divisible by 2.

Let me compute the difference first. Let me expand (n+1)³. I remember that (a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³. So if I let a = n and b = 1, then (n+1)³ = n³ + 3n²(1) + 3n(1)² + 1³ = n³ + 3n² + 3n + 1. 

Therefore, the difference (n+1)³ - n³ would be [n³ + 3n² + 3n + 1] - n³ = 3n² + 3n + 1. So the difference simplifies to 3n² + 3n + 1. 

Now, I need to check whether this expression is ever even. If it's never even, then it's not divisible by 2. So let me analyze the expression 3n² + 3n + 1 modulo 2. 

Alternatively, maybe I can factor it or find some pattern. Let me see. Let's note that 3n² + 3n + 1 can be written as 3(n² + n) + 1. 

But maybe looking at parity is better. Let me think about whether n is even or odd. Let me consider two cases: when n is even and when n is odd.

Case 1: n is even. Let me let n = 2k for some integer k. Then n is even. Let me substitute into the expression 3n² + 3n + 1. 

So substituting n = 2k:

3*(2k)² + 3*(2k) + 1 = 3*(4k²) + 6k + 1 = 12k² + 6k + 1. 

Now, 12k² is even, 6k is even, so adding them together gives even + even = even. Then adding 1 makes it odd. Therefore, when n is even, the difference is odd. 

Case 2: n is odd. Let me let n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Then substituting into the expression:

3*(2k + 1)² + 3*(2k + 1) + 1. Let me compute each term:

First, (2k + 1)² = 4k² + 4k + 1. Then multiplying by 3: 3*(4k² + 4k + 1) = 12k² + 12k + 3.

Then 3*(2k + 1) = 6k + 3.

Adding them together with the last +1:

12k² + 12k + 3 + 6k + 3 + 1 = 12k² + 18k + 7.

Now, let's check the parity. 12k² is even, 18k is even, so 12k² + 18k is even. Then adding 7 (which is odd) gives even + odd = odd. Therefore, when n is odd, the difference is also odd.

So in both cases, whether n is even or odd, the difference 3n² + 3n + 1 is odd. Therefore, it is never divisible by 2. Therefore, the difference of two consecutive cubes is never divisible by 2. 

Wait, but let me check with some examples to make sure. Let's take n = 1: (1+1)^3 - 1^3 = 8 - 1 = 7, which is odd. n = 2: 3³ - 2³ = 27 - 8 = 19, odd. n = 3: 4³ - 3³ = 64 - 27 = 37, odd. n = 0: 1³ - 0³ = 1 - 0 = 1, odd. Negative numbers? Let's try n = -1: 0³ - (-1)^3 = 0 - (-1) = 1, odd. n = -2: (-1)^3 - (-2)^3 = -1 - (-8) = 7, odd. So all these examples give odd numbers. So seems like the conclusion is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Let me think algebraically. The difference is 3n² + 3n + 1. Let me factor 3n(n + 1) + 1. Now, n and n+1 are consecutive integers, so one of them is even. Therefore, n(n + 1) is even. Therefore, 3n(n + 1) is 3 times an even number, which is even. Then adding 1 makes it odd. Therefore, regardless of n, 3n(n + 1) + 1 is odd. Therefore, the difference is always odd. 

Yes, that's another way to see it. Since n(n + 1) is even, multiplying by 3 keeps it even, then adding 1 makes it odd. Therefore, the difference is always odd, so not divisible by 2. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the difference of two consecutive cubes is never divisible by 2. 

But let me check if there's any possible case where it could be even. Suppose n is even: n = 2k. Then n(n + 1) = 2k*(2k + 1), which is even. Multiply by 3: 3*even = even. Add 1: even + 1 = odd. Similarly, if n is odd: n = 2k + 1. Then n + 1 = 2k + 2 = 2(k + 1), so n(n + 1) = (2k + 1)*2(k + 1), which is even. Multiply by 3: even. Add 1: odd. 

Therefore, regardless of n being even or odd, the expression is odd. Therefore, the difference is never divisible by 2. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of modulo 2. Let me compute 3n² + 3n + 1 mod 2. Since 3 ≡ 1 mod 2, so 3n² + 3n + 1 ≡ n² + n + 1 mod 2. 

So let me compute n² + n + 1 mod 2. 

If n is even, n ≡ 0 mod 2. Then n² + n + 1 ≡ 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 mod 2. 

If n is odd, n ≡ 1 mod 2. Then n² + n + 1 ≡ 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ≡ 1 mod 2. 

Therefore, regardless of n, the expression is congruent to 1 mod 2, which is odd. Therefore, the difference is always odd. 

Therefore, this proves that the difference is never divisible by 2. 

So all approaches lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, the statement is true.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}

Wait, hold on. The problem says "Establish that the difference of two consecutive cubes is never divisible by 2." But my final answer was written as \boxed{1}. That seems odd. Wait, maybe I confused the answer. Wait, the question is not asking for the difference, but to establish that it's never divisible by 2. So the answer is not a numerical value, but rather a proof. However, the user instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Maybe they expect a statement or maybe a specific value? Wait, but the problem is to establish that the difference is never divisible by 2. So perhaps the answer is that it's always odd, so the difference is 1 mod 2.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the final answer. Let me check again. The difference is 3n² + 3n + 1. For example, when n=1, difference is 7, which is 7 mod 2 = 1. When n=2, difference is 19, which is 1 mod 2. So the difference is always 1 mod 2. Therefore, the difference is always odd. Therefore, the answer is that it is always odd, which is 1 mod 2, so \boxed{1} is the remainder when divided by 2. But maybe the problem is not expecting that. However, given the user's instruction to put the final answer in a box, and given that the difference is always odd, which is 1 mod 2, maybe the answer is \boxed{1}.

However, in math problems, if you have to prove something, you don't put a box around a statement. However, given that the original problem might have been in a context where the answer is a number, but in this case, since the problem is to establish that it's never divisible by 2, perhaps the answer is simply stating that, but since the user wants a box, maybe the answer is \boxed{1} as the remainder when divided by 2. However, I think that's not the standard way.

But I need to check again. If I write \boxed{1}, does that make sense? In some contexts, yes, if the question is about the remainder when divided by 2. But the question is not asking for the remainder, it's asking to establish that it's never divisible by 2. However, since the user might have expected that, maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply stating that it's not divisible by 2, but in the absence of a specific format, maybe the answer is \boxed{1}. 

Alternatively, maybe the original problem is in Chinese or another language, and the translation is "Establish that the difference... is never divisible by 2," and the answer is 1, but I think that's not correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting me to write the difference formula, but no. Given that, I think the safest way is to state that the difference is always odd, so it is never divisible by 2. However, since the user wants a boxed answer, maybe they expect \boxed{1} as the remainder when divided by 2. Therefore, I think I should go with \boxed{1} as the final answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
</think>

To determine whether the difference between two consecutive cubes is **never divisible by 2**, we begin by expressing the difference algebraically.

Let the two consecutive integers be $ n $ and $ n+1 $. The difference between their cubes is:

$$
(n+1)^3 - n^3
$$

Expanding $ (n+1)^3 $ using the binomial theorem:

$$
(n+1)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1
$$

Subtracting $ n^3 $, we get the difference:

$$
(n+1)^3 - n^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 1
$$

---

### Step 1: Analyze the Parity of the Expression

We now examine the expression $ 3n^2 + 3n + 1 $ to determine whether it is divisible by 2.

#### Case 1: $ n $ is even

Let $ n = 2k $ for some integer $ k $. Then:

$$
3n^2 + 3n + 1 = 3(2k)^2 + 3(2k) + 1 = 12k^2 + 6k + 1
$$

All terms $ 12k^2 $ and $ 6k $ are even, and adding 1 makes the result **odd**.

#### Case 2: $ n $ is odd

Let $ n = 2k + 1 $. Then:

$$
3n^2 + 3n + 1 = 3(2k+1)^2 + 3(2k+1) + 1 = 3(4k^2 + 4k + 1) + 6k + 3 + 1
$$

Simplifying:

$$
= 12k^2 + 12k + 3 + 6k + 3 + 1 = 12k^2 + 18k + 7
$$

Again, $ 12k^2 + 18k $ is even, and adding 7 (odd) gives an **odd** result.

---

### Step 2: General Argument Using Modulo 2

We can also analyze the expression modulo 2:

$$
3n^2 + 3n + 1 \equiv n^2 + n + 1 \pmod{2}
$$

Because $ 3 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} $.

Now consider:

- If $ n \equiv 0 \pmod{2} $, then $ n^2 + n + 1 \equiv 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \pmod{2} $
- If $ n \equiv 1 \pmod{2} $, then $ n^2 + n + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} $

So in all cases, the expression is congruent to **1 modulo 2**, i.e., it is **odd**.

---

### Conclusion

Since the difference $ (n+1)^3 - n^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 1 $ is always **odd**, it is **never divisible by 2**.

Thus, the difference of two consecutive cubes is **never divisible by 2**.
