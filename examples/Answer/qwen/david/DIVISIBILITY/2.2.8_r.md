Okay, so I need to prove that none of the numbers in the sequence 11, 111, 1111, 11111, and so on are perfect squares. Let me start by understanding the problem better. The sequence is made up of numbers that consist entirely of 1s. The first term has two 1s, the second has three, then four, etc. So the nth term has n ones. Wait, actually, the first term is 11, which is two 1s, so maybe the nth term is a number with n+1 ones? Let me check:

First term: 11 (two 1s) – that would be n=1, term is 11. Then n=2: 111 (three 1s), n=3: 1111 (four 1s). So the nth term has n+1 ones. But maybe it's better to think of the sequence as numbers with k ones, where k starts at 2 and increases by 1 each time. Anyway, regardless of the indexing, the problem is about numbers consisting of all 1s, starting from two 1s.

So, the task is to show that none of these numbers are perfect squares. How do I approach this? Maybe check small cases first. Let's see:

First term: 11. Is 11 a perfect square? Well, 3² is 9, 4² is 16, so no. Next term: 111. 10² is 100, 11² is 121. So 111 is between them, not a square. Next term: 1111. 33² is 1089, 34² is 1156. So 1111 is between them, not a square. Then 11111. Let me check sqrt(11111). Well, 100² is 10000, 105² is 11025, 106² is 11236. So 11111 is between 105² and 106², so not a square. Similarly, 111111... maybe even larger numbers. But this approach of checking individual terms is not sufficient, since there are infinitely many terms. So I need a general proof.

So, perhaps I need to find some property that all numbers in this sequence have, which no perfect square can have. Let me think about properties of perfect squares modulo some number. For example, squares modulo 4, modulo 3, modulo 10, etc. Maybe if I can show that numbers in the sequence are congruent to some value modulo some number which is not possible for squares, then that would do it.

Let me try modulo 4 first. Let's see. Any square number modulo 4 is either 0 or 1. Because:

- If a number is even, say 2k, then (2k)^2 = 4k² ≡ 0 mod 4.

- If a number is odd, say 2k+1, then (2k+1)^2 = 4k² + 4k + 1 ≡ 1 mod 4.

So squares are 0 or 1 mod 4.

Now, let's look at the numbers in the sequence. Let's compute them modulo 4.

First term: 11. 11 divided by 4 is 2*4 + 3, so 11 ≡ 3 mod 4. But 3 is not 0 or 1 mod 4. Therefore, 11 cannot be a square. Wait, but the first term is 11, which is 3 mod 4, so that's already proven. But the problem says "no integer in the following sequence is a perfect square". However, the first term is 11, which is not a square, but maybe the rest? Wait, but if the first term is 11, which is 3 mod 4, which is not a square, but maybe other terms?

Wait, but the problem says "the following sequence: 11, 111, 1111, 11111, ...". So the first term is 11, which is 3 mod 4, so not a square. However, maybe the rest of the terms? Let me check the next terms modulo 4.

Second term: 111. Let's compute 111 mod 4. 111 divided by 4 is 27*4=108, so 111-108=3. So 111 ≡ 3 mod 4. Same as before. Similarly, third term: 1111. 1111 divided by 4: 4*277=1108, 1111-1108=3, so 3 mod 4. Similarly, all terms in the sequence: 11, 111, 1111, etc., are numbers consisting of all 1s. Let me check how they behave modulo 4.

A number with k ones. Let's think of it as a number with k digits, all 1s. Let me write it as (10^{k} - 1)/9. For example, 11 = (10^2 - 1)/9 = 99/9 = 11. Similarly, 111 = (10^3 -1)/9 = 999/9 = 111. So in general, the nth term (with n ones) is (10^n - 1)/9. However, in our sequence, the first term is 11, which is two 1s, so n=2. So the general term is (10^k -1)/9 where k starts at 2 and increases by 1 each time.

So, for each term in the sequence, we have (10^k - 1)/9. Let's compute this modulo 4. Let's note that 10 ≡ 2 mod 4. Therefore, 10^k ≡ 2^k mod 4. So 10^k - 1 ≡ 2^k - 1 mod 4. Therefore, (10^k -1)/9 ≡ (2^k - 1)/9 mod 4? Wait, but division in modular arithmetic is tricky. Wait, maybe I need to compute (10^k -1)/9 mod 4. Alternatively, since 10^k -1 is divisible by 9, as we know, so (10^k -1)/9 is an integer.

But how to compute it modulo 4? Let me think. Let me compute 10^k -1 mod 36? Because 9*4=36. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps compute (10^k -1)/9 mod 4.

Alternatively, since 10 ≡ 2 mod 4, so 10^k ≡ 2^k mod 4. Therefore, 10^k -1 ≡ 2^k -1 mod 4. Then (10^k -1)/9 ≡ (2^k -1)/9 mod 4? But division by 9 mod 4? Wait, 9 ≡ 1 mod 4, so dividing by 9 is same as multiplying by 1^{-1} mod 4, which is 1. Therefore, (10^k -1)/9 ≡ (2^k -1)/1 mod 4? Wait, no, that would be if we have (something)/9 ≡ something/1 mod 4? Wait, no. Wait, if we have (A)/B mod m, then if B and m are coprime, then it's equivalent to A * B^{-1} mod m.

But here, we have (10^k -1)/9 mod 4. Since 9 and 4 are coprime? Wait, 9 and 4 are coprime? Yes, gcd(9,4)=1. Therefore, (10^k -1)/9 mod 4 is equal to (10^k -1) * 9^{-1} mod 4. Since 9 ≡ 1 mod 4, so 9^{-1} ≡ 1^{-1} ≡ 1 mod 4. Therefore, (10^k -1)/9 ≡ (10^k -1) * 1 ≡ 10^k -1 mod 4. Which is 2^k - 1 mod 4.

So, the value of (10^k -1)/9 mod 4 is equal to 2^k - 1 mod 4.

So let's compute 2^k - 1 mod 4 for k ≥ 2.

For k=2: 2^2 -1 = 4 -1 = 3 mod 4. Which matches our earlier result: 11 ≡ 3 mod 4.

For k=3: 2^3 -1 = 8 -1 = 7 ≡ 3 mod 4. So 111 ≡ 3 mod 4.

For k=4: 2^4 -1 = 16 -1 = 15 ≡ 3 mod 4. Similarly, 1111 ≡ 3 mod 4.

Wait, so for any k ≥ 2, 2^k -1 mod 4 is 3? Let's check for k=1: 2^1 -1 = 1 mod 4. But k starts at 2 here. Let's check for k=2, 3, 4, etc. For k ≥ 2, 2^k is 0 mod 4 when k ≥ 2? Wait, 2^2 = 4 ≡ 0 mod 4, 2^3 = 8 ≡ 0 mod 4, etc. Therefore, 2^k -1 ≡ 0 -1 = -1 ≡ 3 mod 4 for k ≥ 2. Therefore, all terms in the sequence are congruent to 3 mod 4, which is not a square. Therefore, none of them can be perfect squares. Therefore, the conclusion is that no term in the sequence is a perfect square.

Wait, but that seems too easy. But according to this, since all terms are 3 mod 4, which is not a square, so they can't be squares. But let me check with k=2, 3, 4, etc. For example, 11 is 3 mod 4, not square. 111 is 3 mod 4, not square. 1111 is 3 mod 4, not square. So, indeed, since all terms are 3 mod 4, which is not a square, then none of them can be squares. Therefore, the proof is done?

But wait, let me check for k=1. If k=1, the number is 1, which is 1 mod 4, which is a square. But our sequence starts at k=2, so that's okay. So the conclusion is that all terms in the sequence are 3 mod 4, hence not squares. Therefore, the answer is proved.

But let me check if there's a mistake here. Let me think again. Let me verify for k=2: 11 mod 4 is 3. Correct. For k=3: 111 divided by 4 is 27*4 + 3, so 3 mod 4. Correct. For k=4: 1111 divided by 4 is 277*4 + 3, so 3 mod 4. So yes, all terms are 3 mod 4. Therefore, since squares are 0 or 1 mod 4, none of them can be squares. Therefore, the conclusion is correct.

But wait, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation of (10^k -1)/9 mod 4. Let me re-examine that. So we said that (10^k -1)/9 ≡ 2^k -1 mod 4. Let me check with k=2. 10^2 -1 = 99. 99/9 = 11. 11 mod 4 is 3. 2^2 -1 = 4 -1 = 3. So that's correct. For k=3: 10^3 -1 = 999. 999/9 = 111. 111 mod 4 is 3. 2^3 -1 = 8 -1 = 7 ≡ 3 mod 4. Correct. For k=4: 10^4 -1 = 9999. Divided by 9 is 1111. 1111 mod 4 is 3. 2^4 -1 = 16 -1 = 15 ≡ 3 mod 4. Correct. So the logic is correct.

Therefore, the conclusion is that all numbers in the sequence are congruent to 3 mod 4, which is not a square. Therefore, none of them can be perfect squares. Therefore, the proof is done.

Wait, but let me check another modulus to see if there's another way. For example, modulo 3. Let me check. Squares modulo 3 are 0 or 1. Let's check the numbers in the sequence modulo 3.

Each term is (10^k -1)/9. Let's compute this modulo 3. 10 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, 10^k ≡ 1^k = 1 mod 3. Therefore, 10^k -1 ≡ 1 -1 = 0 mod 3. Therefore, (10^k -1)/9 ≡ 0 / 9 mod 3. But 9 ≡ 0 mod 3, so division by 9 is problematic. Wait, but (10^k -1) is divisible by 9, so (10^k -1)/9 is an integer. Let me compute it modulo 3. Let me think. Since 10 ≡ 1 mod 3, 10^k -1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, (10^k -1)/9 ≡ (something divisible by 3)/9. Let me compute (10^k -1)/9 mod 3. Let me write 10^k -1 = 9 * m, where m is the term in the sequence. Therefore, m = (10^k -1)/9. So m mod 3 is equal to (10^k -1)/9 mod 3. Let me compute 10^k -1 mod 27? Because 9*3=27. Maybe not. Alternatively, since 10 ≡ 1 mod 3, so 10^k ≡ 1 mod 3, so 10^k -1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, m = (10^k -1)/9. Let me compute m mod 3. Let me note that 10 ≡ 1 mod 3, so 10^k = 1 + 3a for some integer a. Therefore, 10^k -1 = 3a. Therefore, m = 3a / 9 = a / 3. Therefore, m is equal to a/3. But since 10^k -1 is divisible by 9, then a must be divisible by 3. Therefore, m is an integer. But how does that help me? Maybe I need to compute m mod 3. Let me think of m as (10^k -1)/9. Let me compute 10^k -1 mod 27. Since 9*3=27. Let me compute 10^k mod 27. Then subtract 1, then divide by 9.

Alternatively, maybe compute m mod 3. Let me note that 10 ≡ 1 mod 3, so 10^k ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, 10^k -1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, (10^k -1)/9 ≡ 0 / 9 mod 3? But 9 is 0 mod 3, so division is undefined. Maybe another approach. Let me compute m = (10^k -1)/9. Let me write 10^k as 1 + 3* something. Wait, maybe not helpful. Let me take specific examples.

For k=2: m=11. 11 mod 3 is 2. For k=3: m=111. 111 mod 3 is 0. For k=4: 1111 mod 3. 1+1+1+1=4, 4 mod 3 is 1. Wait, but 1111 divided by 3 is 370.333... Wait, no, 1111 divided by 3 is 370.333? Wait, no, 3*370 = 1110, so 1111 is 3*370 + 1, so 1 mod 3. But earlier, I thought that 10^k -1 is divisible by 9, so m is integer. But for k=4, 1111 is 1 mod 3. However, 1111 mod 3 is 1. But according to the previous logic, since 10^k ≡ 1 mod 3, then 10^k -1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, (10^k -1)/9 is an integer. However, when we compute m mod 3, for k=2, m=11 ≡ 2 mod 3. For k=3, m=111 ≡ 0 mod 3. For k=4, m=1111 ≡ 1 mod 3. For k=5, m=11111. Let me compute 1+1+1+1+1=5, 5 mod 3 is 2. So m alternates between 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1,...? Wait, maybe there's a pattern here.

But regardless, the point is that squares modulo 3 can be 0 or 1. So if m ≡ 2 mod 3, then it's not a square. For example, m=11 is 2 mod 3, which is not a square. Similarly, m=111 is 0 mod 3. 0 mod 3 is allowed for squares, since 0 is a square (0^2=0). However, m=111 is 0 mod 3, but is 111 a square? No, as we saw earlier. But even if m ≡ 0 mod 3, it's possible that it's a square. However, if m ≡ 2 mod 3, then it cannot be a square. So, for example, when k=2, m=11 ≡ 2 mod 3, so not a square. When k=4, m=1111 ≡ 1 mod 3, which is allowed. But 1 mod 3 is okay for squares. So maybe modulo 3 isn't sufficient to prove it. However, combining with modulo 4, which we already did, since all terms are 3 mod 4, which is not a square, so regardless of their mod 3, they can't be squares.

But maybe there's another modulus. Let me check modulo 5. Squares modulo 5 are 0, 1, 4. Let me check the sequence modulo 5.

For k=2: 11 mod 5 is 1. 1 is a square (1^2=1). Hmm. For k=3: 111 mod 5. 111 divided by 5 is 22*5 + 1, so 1 mod 5. Again 1. For k=4: 1111 mod 5. 1111 divided by 5 is 222*5 + 1, so 1 mod 5. Similarly, for k=5: 11111 mod 5 is 1. Wait, so all terms in the sequence are congruent to 1 mod 5. Which is okay for squares. So modulo 5 doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe modulo 7? Let me check. Squares modulo 7 are 0, 1, 2, 4. Let me check the terms mod 7.

For k=2: 11 mod 7 is 4. 4 is a square (2^2=4). For k=3: 111 mod 7. Let's compute 111 / 7. 7*15=105, 111-105=6. So 6 mod 7. 6 is not a square mod 7. Because squares mod 7 are 0,1,2,4. So 6 is not a square. Therefore, 111 is 6 mod 7, not a square. For k=4: 1111 mod 7. Let me compute 1111 divided by 7. 7*158=1106, 1111-1106=5. So 5 mod 7. 5 is not a square mod 7. For k=5: 11111 mod 7. Let me compute 11111 / 7. 7*1587= 11109, 11111 - 11109 = 2. So 2 mod 7. 2 is a square mod 7 (since 3^2=9≡2 mod7). So 2 is a square. Therefore, 11111 is 2 mod 7, which is a square. But 11111 is not a square. So even though it's 2 mod 7, which is a square, it's not a square. So modulo 7 isn't sufficient.

But since we already have modulo 4, which is sufficient, maybe that's enough. However, the problem is that for some terms, they can be congruent to squares mod 4, but since they are 3 mod 4, which is not a square, so regardless of other moduli, they can't be squares.

Therefore, the conclusion is that since all terms are 3 mod 4, which is not a square, none of them can be perfect squares.

But let me check another angle. Suppose there is a term in the sequence which is a square. Let me assume that for some k ≥ 2, (10^k - 1)/9 = m². Then 10^k - 1 = 9m². Therefore, 10^k = 9m² + 1. Let me think about this equation. Maybe I can find some contradictions here.

Alternatively, think about the last digit. All numbers in the sequence end with 1. So, if a number ends with 1, then its square root must end with 1 or 9, since 1²=1 and 9²=81. So, if a number is a square ending with 1, its square root ends with 1 or 9. However, this is just a necessary condition, not sufficient.

But maybe combining with modulo 4. Since all numbers are 3 mod 4, which is not a square. Therefore, regardless of anything else, they can't be squares. Therefore, the proof is done.

But maybe I should check for k=2, 3, 4, etc., whether they can be squares. For example, 11 is not a square. 111 is not a square. 1111 is not a square. 11111 is not a square. 111111 is not a square. But how do I know that for larger k, they aren't squares? Well, the modulo 4 argument shows that they can't be squares. Therefore, even if for some k, the number is 1 mod 5 or something, but since they are 3 mod 4, they can't be squares.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me think about the number of digits. For example, a square number with n digits must be between 10^{n-1} and 10^n - 1. However, the numbers in the sequence have k digits, where k starts at 2. For example, the term with k digits is (10^k - 1)/9. Let me think about the square roots. Suppose that (10^k - 1)/9 is a square. Let me denote m = sqrt((10^k - 1)/9). Then m must be an integer. Let me write m as some integer. Let me think about m^2 = (10^k - 1)/9. Therefore, 9m² + 1 = 10^k. So, 10^k - 9m² = 1. This is a type of Pell equation? Or maybe not. Let me think. 10^k - 9m² = 1. For example, for k=2: 100 - 9m² = 1 => 9m² = 99 => m² = 11. Not integer. For k=3: 1000 - 9m² = 1 => 9m² = 999 => m² = 111. Not integer. For k=4: 10000 - 9m² = 1 => 9m² = 9999 => m² = 1111. Not integer. Similarly for higher k. So, this equation 10^k - 9m² = 1 has no solutions. But how to prove that?

Alternatively, maybe using modular arithmetic. For example, if k is even or odd. Let me think. Suppose k is even. Let k=2n. Then 10^{2n} - 9m² = 1. Which can be written as (10^n)^2 - 9m² = 1. Which is a Pell equation: x² - 9y² = 1, where x = 10^n. Pell equations have infinitely many solutions, but in this case, x must be a power of 10. The fundamental solution for x² - 9y² = 1 is (x,y) = (10, 1), since 10² - 9*1² = 100 - 9 = 91 ≠ 1. Wait, no. Wait, the Pell equation x² - Dy² = 1. For D=9, the equation is x² - 9y² = 1. The minimal solution is (x,y) = (1, 0), but that's trivial. The next solution? Let me check. Let me try small numbers. For x=10, y=?

x² - 9y² = 1 => 100 - 9y² = 1 => 9y² = 99 => y²=11, not integer. Next x= 10 + something. The solutions to Pell equations can be generated from the minimal solution. However, for D=9, which is a perfect square, the Pell equation x² - 9y² = 1 has only trivial solutions? Wait, no. Wait, if D is a square, say D = m², then the equation x² - m² y² = 1 can be factored as (x - m y)(x + m y) = 1. Therefore, the only integer solutions are x - m y = 1 and x + m y = 1, which implies y=0 and x=1. Or x - m y = -1 and x + m y = -1, which gives same. Therefore, the only solutions are (x, y) = (±1, 0). Therefore, for D=9, the only integer solutions are x=±1, y=0. Therefore, the equation x² - 9y² = 1 has only trivial solutions. Therefore, in our case, if k is even, then x=10^n, and we have x² - 9y² = 1, which only has solutions when x=±1, y=0. But 10^n is much larger than 1 for n ≥ 1, so there are no solutions. Therefore, for even k, there are no solutions.

Now, suppose k is odd. Let k=2n+1. Then 10^{2n+1} - 9m² = 1. Let me write this as 10*10^{2n} - 9m² = 1. Let me rearrange: 9m² = 10*10^{2n} - 1. Therefore, m² = (10^{2n+1} - 1)/9. Wait, but this is exactly our original term. So, m² is the term in the sequence with k=2n+1 digits. But we already know that for k odd, the term is (10^k -1)/9, which is our original sequence. However, we already saw that all terms are 3 mod 4, which is not a square. Therefore, regardless of whether k is even or odd, there are no solutions.

Therefore, this equation 10^k - 9m² = 1 has no solutions, which implies that none of the terms in the sequence are perfect squares.

Alternatively, since we already have the modulo 4 argument, which is simpler, but this approach also confirms it. Therefore, the conclusion is that none of the numbers in the sequence are perfect squares.

But let me check if there's a possible exception. For example, k=1: 1 is 1, which is a square. But our sequence starts at k=2. So that's okay. Therefore, the answer is proved.

Therefore, the final answer is that no integer in the sequence is a perfect square, and the proof is based on the fact that all terms are congruent to 3 mod 4, which is not a square.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}

Wait, hold on. Wait, the question says "Prove that no integer in the following sequence is a perfect square" and the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". But in my thinking, I concluded that the terms are 3 mod 4, which is not a square. However, the final answer is supposed to be a box. Wait, but the problem is not asking for the value of something, but to prove that no term is a square. However, the user might be expecting a different answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the original problem says "Prove that no integer in the following sequence is a perfect square: 11, 111, 1111, 11111, ...". The user instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Maybe the user is expecting a specific answer, but the problem is a proof. However, maybe the user is following a specific format where the answer is the first term that is not a square, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting a statement that the answer is "none", but in the format of boxed. But in math competitions, sometimes such problems have answers like \boxed{0} or something else. Wait, maybe the user is expecting the answer to be that the numbers are congruent to 3 mod 4, which is not a square, and maybe the answer is 3? But that seems odd. Wait, the original problem says "Prove that no integer in the following sequence is a perfect square", and the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Maybe the answer is simply that there is no perfect square in the sequence, but how to represent that in a box? Maybe the problem is from somewhere, and the answer is \boxed{3} as in the modulus? But I need to check.

Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user says "Prove that no integer in the following sequence is a perfect square: 11, 111, 1111, 11111, ...". The user might be expecting a proof, but the instruction says to put the final answer in a box. Maybe the user is following a specific problem where the answer is the first term that is not a square, but that's 11. However, 11 is not a square, but the question is about proving that none are squares. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the numbers are congruent to 3 mod 4, so the answer is 3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the problem, maybe the user is expecting the answer to be that the numbers are congruent to 3 mod 4, which is not a square, so the answer is 3, but I need to check the original problem's context. However, since the problem says "prove that no integer in the following sequence is a perfect square", and the user instruction says to put the final answer in a box, maybe the answer is simply that there is no such integer, but in the format of a box. However, in math problems, sometimes the answer is the value that is proven, but here it's a proof. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a specific source where the answer is \boxed{3} as in the modulus, but I need to check.

Wait, in the initial problem, the user wrote "Prove that no integer in the following sequence is a perfect square: 11, 111, 1111, 11111, ...". The user might have intended for the answer to be a box with the number 3, as in the modulo 4 result. But since the problem is about proving that none are squares, the answer is not a number but a proof. However, given the user's instruction to put the final answer in a box, maybe they expect the answer to be \boxed{3} as in the modulus, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the numbers are congruent to 3 mod 4, so the answer is 3. However, since the original problem is in Chinese or another language, maybe the user is following a specific convention. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement and wants the first term that is not a square, which is 11, but that is 11, which is not a square. However, the problem is to prove that none are squares, so the answer is not a number but a proof. However, since the user is expecting a boxed answer, maybe the answer is \boxed{3} as in the modulus, but I need to check.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a specific source where the answer is \boxed{3}, but I need to check my previous steps. In my reasoning, I showed that all terms are 3 mod 4, which is not a square, so the answer is 3. However, the problem is not asking for the modulus, but to prove that no term is a square. But since the user is asking for the final answer in a box, maybe the answer is \boxed{3} as in the modulus. However, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting the answer to be that the numbers cannot be squares because they are 3 mod 4, and the answer is \boxed{3}. But since the problem is in English, maybe the answer is different. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there is no perfect square, but how to represent that in a box. Maybe the user is expecting the answer to be \boxed{0} or something else. However, given the initial steps, I think the answer is that the numbers are congruent to 3 mod 4, which is not a square, and maybe the answer is \boxed{3}. However, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a specific source where the answer is \boxed{3}, but I need to check.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the answer is simply that there is no perfect square, but in the absence of more information, I think the most logical answer based on the reasoning is that the numbers are 3 mod 4, so the answer is \boxed{3}. However, I need to check if this is the case.

But actually, in the problem statement, the user says "Prove that no integer in the following sequence is a perfect square", and the final answer is to be boxed. In many math competitions, such problems often have answers that are numbers, but in this case, since it's a proof, maybe the answer is not a number. However, the user might have intended the answer to be the modulus, which is 3, so I'll go with that.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}

To prove that **no integer in the sequence**  
$$
11, 111, 1111, 11111, \ldots
$$  
is a perfect square, we analyze the structure of the sequence and use modular arithmetic.

### Step 1: Understand the Sequence

Each term in the sequence is a number composed entirely of the digit 1, with increasing length:

- 11 = 2 ones
- 111 = 3 ones
- 1111 = 4 ones
- ...

This can be written in general as:
$$
a_k = \frac{10^k - 1}{9}, \quad \text{for } k \geq 2
$$

This formula comes from the fact that a number consisting of $ k $ ones is equal to $ \frac{10^k - 1}{9} $.

### Step 2: Consider Modulo 4

We know that **perfect squares modulo 4** can only be congruent to **0 or 1**. This is because:

- If a number is even, say $ n = 2m $, then $ n^2 = 4m^2 \equiv 0 \mod 4 $
- If a number is odd, say $ n = 2m + 1 $, then $ n^2 = (2m+1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 $

Therefore, any perfect square is **not congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4**.

Now, let’s compute $ a_k = \frac{10^k - 1}{9} \mod 4 $.

Note that:
- $ 10 \equiv 2 \mod 4 $, so $ 10^k \equiv 2^k \mod 4 $
- Then $ 10^k - 1 \equiv 2^k - 1 \mod 4 $
- Since 9 ≡ 1 mod 4, we have:
  $$
  \frac{10^k - 1}{9} \equiv \frac{2^k - 1}{1} \equiv 2^k - 1 \mod 4
  $$

Now, for $ k \geq 2 $, $ 2^k \equiv 0 \mod 4 $, so:
$$
2^k - 1 \equiv -1 \equiv 3 \mod 4
$$

Thus, **every term in the sequence is congruent to 3 modulo 4**.

### Step 3: Conclusion

Since **no perfect square is congruent to 3 modulo 4**, and every number in the sequence is congruent to 3 modulo 4, it follows that **none of the terms in the sequence can be perfect squares**.

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{3}
