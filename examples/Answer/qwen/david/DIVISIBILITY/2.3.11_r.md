Okay, so I need to verify that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b is the same as the gcd of -a and b, and similarly for the other combinations. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the gcd actually is. The gcd of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. But since we're dealing with negative numbers here, I need to remember that the gcd is always a positive integer, right?

So, if a and b are integers, not both zero, then gcd(a, b) is the same as gcd(-a, b), and similarly for the others. Let me think about how the negative signs affect the divisors. If I have a divisor of a, say d, then d also divides -a because multiplying by -1 doesn't change the divisibility. Similarly, if d divides -a, it also divides a. So, the set of divisors of a and -a should be the same, right? Therefore, their gcds should be the same.

Wait, let me formalize this. Suppose d is a common divisor of a and b. Then d divides a and d divides b. If I replace a with -a, since d divides a, it also divides -a. Therefore, d is still a common divisor of -a and b. Conversely, if d is a common divisor of -a and b, then it divides -a and hence divides a. Therefore, the set of common divisors of a and b is the same as the set of common divisors of -a and b. Since the gcd is the greatest common divisor, they must be equal. Therefore, gcd(a, b) = gcd(-a, b). Similarly, the same logic applies for gcd(a, -b) and gcd(-a, -b). 

But let me check with an example. Let's take a = 4 and b = 6. Then gcd(4, 6) is 2. Now, gcd(-4, 6) would be gcd(4, 6) which is 2. Similarly, gcd(4, -6) is also 2, and gcd(-4, -6) is 2. So that works. Another example: a = -6, b = 9. gcd(-6, 9) is 3. gcd(6, 9) is also 3. So that seems to hold.

But maybe I should think more formally. Let me recall the definition of gcd. The gcd of two integers a and b is the smallest positive integer that divides both a and b. Wait, no, actually, it's the largest positive integer that divides both. So, if we have a common divisor, it's the same regardless of the sign of the numbers. Because divisors are defined up to sign. For example, if d divides a, then -d also divides a. But since gcd is always positive, the gcd of a and b is the same as gcd of -a and b because the negative sign doesn't affect the divisors' absolute values.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm says that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b), and so on. But if we replace a with -a, then gcd(-a, b) = gcd(b, -a mod b). But -a mod b is the same as b - (a mod b), right? Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Let me think.

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b) is the same as gcd(|a|, |b|). Because the gcd is always positive, and the absolute value of the numbers doesn't affect the divisors. Therefore, gcd(a, b) = gcd(|a|, |b|). Therefore, gcd(-a, b) = gcd(|-a|, |b|) = gcd(|a|, |b|) = gcd(a, b). Similarly for the others. Therefore, this shows that all four combinations are equal.

But wait, is that a valid reasoning? Let me check. If I take gcd(a, b), it's the same as gcd(|a|, |b|). So, if I replace a with -a, then gcd(-a, b) is the same as gcd(|-a|, |b|) which is gcd(|a|, |b|). Therefore, yes, that works. Therefore, all four combinations are equal.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the property that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b + ka) for any integer k. So, if I take k = 1, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b + a). But how does that help with negative numbers?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, -b). Let me try to prove that. Let me suppose that d divides a and b. Then d divides a and d divides -b, so d divides a and -b. Therefore, d divides gcd(a, -b). Conversely, if d divides a and -b, then d divides a and d divides -b, so d divides b. Therefore, d divides gcd(a, b). Therefore, the set of common divisors of a and b is the same as the set of common divisors of a and -b. Therefore, their gcds are equal. Therefore, gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, -b). Similarly, gcd(a, b) = gcd(-a, b) = gcd(-a, -b). 

This seems solid. So, in general, the gcd is unaffected by the sign of the numbers because the divisors are considered in absolute value. Therefore, the gcd of a and b is the same as the gcd of -a and b, and so on.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose a is negative. Let me take a = -4, b = 6. Then gcd(-4, 6) is 2, which is the same as gcd(4, 6). Similarly, if a = -4, b = -6, gcd(-4, -6) is 2, same as gcd(4, 6). So, regardless of the signs, the gcd remains the same. Therefore, all four combinations are equal.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the definition of gcd in terms of linear combinations. The gcd of a and b is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as ax + by for integers x and y. If we replace a with -a, then the gcd of -a and b is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as (-a)x + by. But that's the same as -ax + by, which is the same as ax' + by where x' = -x. Therefore, the set of linear combinations is the same. Therefore, the gcd remains the same. Therefore, gcd(-a, b) = gcd(a, b). Similarly for others.

Therefore, combining all these reasoning steps, it seems that the gcd is indeed the same regardless of the sign of a or b. Therefore, the equality holds.

But let me check another example where one of the numbers is negative. Let's say a = 3, b = -5. Then gcd(3, -5) is 1. Similarly, gcd(-3, -5) is 1. gcd(-3, 5) is 1. gcd(3, 5) is 1. So, all are 1. So that works. Another example: a = 0, b = 5. Wait, but the problem says that a and b are not both zero. So, if a is 0, then gcd(0, b) is |b|. Similarly, gcd(0, -b) is |b|. So, that also holds. For example, gcd(0, 5) = 5, gcd(0, -5) = 5, gcd(-0, 5) = 5, etc. Since -0 is 0, so that's consistent.

Therefore, all cases seem to check out. Therefore, the conclusion is that gcd(a, b) = gcd(-a, b) = gcd(a, -b) = gcd(-a, -b).

I think that covers all the cases. The key idea is that the gcd is always a positive integer, and the divisors of a number are the same as those of its negative. Therefore, changing the sign of either number doesn't affect the set of common divisors, hence the gcd remains the same.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{gcd(a, b) = gcd(-a, b) = gcd(a, -b) = gcd(-a, -b)}
</think>

To verify the identity

$$
\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(-a, b) = \gcd(a, -b) = \gcd(-a, -b)
$$

for integers $ a $ and $ b $, not both zero, we rely on the fundamental properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd).

### Key Observations:

1. **Definition of gcd**:
   The gcd of two integers $ a $ and $ b $ is the **largest positive integer** that divides both $ a $ and $ b $.

2. **Divisibility and Negative Numbers**:
   If $ d \mid a $, then $ d \mid -a $, and vice versa. This is because multiplying by $ -1 $ does not affect divisibility.

3. **Absolute Values**:
   Since the gcd is always a **positive integer**, the sign of the numbers does not affect the gcd. That is, $ \gcd(a, b) = \gcd(|a|, |b|) $.

4. **Linear Combinations**:
   The gcd of two integers is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as a linear combination $ ax + by $, where $ x, y \in \mathbb{Z} $. Changing the sign of $ a $ or $ b $ does not affect the set of possible linear combinations, because $ -a x = a(-x) $, and so on.

### Formal Argument:

Letâ€™s prove that $ \gcd(a, b) = \gcd(-a, b) $:

- Suppose $ d $ is a common divisor of $ a $ and $ b $. Then $ d \mid a $ and $ d \mid b $. Since $ d \mid a $, it also divides $ -a $, so $ d \mid -a $ and $ d \mid b $, meaning $ d $ is a common divisor of $ -a $ and $ b $.

- Conversely, if $ d $ is a common divisor of $ -a $ and $ b $, then $ d \mid -a $, so $ d \mid a $, and hence $ d $ is a common divisor of $ a $ and $ b $.

Therefore, the set of common divisors of $ a $ and $ b $ is the same as that of $ -a $ and $ b $, and so their gcds are equal.

This reasoning applies symmetrically to $ \gcd(a, -b) $, $ \gcd(-a, -b) $, and so on. In all cases, the set of common divisors remains the same, and hence the gcd is unchanged.

### Conclusion:

The gcd is invariant under sign changes of the inputs. Therefore, we conclude:

$$
\boxed{gcd(a, b) = gcd(-a, b) = gcd(a, -b) = gcd(-a, -b)}
$$
