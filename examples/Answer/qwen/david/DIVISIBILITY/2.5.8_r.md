Okay, so I have these five puzzles to solve. Let me take them one by one. Starting with part (a):

**Problem (a):** Alcuin of York, 775. One hundred bushels of grain are distributed among 100 persons in such a way that each man receives 3 bushels, each woman 2 bushels, and each child 1/2 bushel. How many men, women, and children are there?

Alright, so there are 100 people total, and 100 bushels of grain. Each man gets 3, woman 2, child 0.5. Let me think. Let me denote the number of men as m, women as w, and children as c. So, we have two equations:

1. m + w + c = 100 (total people)
2. 3m + 2w + 0.5c = 100 (total bushels)

Hmm, so two equations with three variables. But since we need integer solutions, maybe we can find integers m, w, c that satisfy both equations.

Let me try to express one variable in terms of others. From the first equation, c = 100 - m - w. Substitute into the second equation:

3m + 2w + 0.5*(100 - m - w) = 100

Let me compute that:

3m + 2w + 50 - 0.5m - 0.5w = 100

Combine like terms:

(3m - 0.5m) + (2w - 0.5w) + 50 = 100

Which is 2.5m + 1.5w + 50 = 100

Subtract 50:

2.5m + 1.5w = 50

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate decimals:

5m + 3w = 100

So now, 5m + 3w = 100. Now, we need to find integers m and w such that this equation holds, and also m, w, c are non-negative integers.

Let me think. Let's solve for w:

3w = 100 - 5m => w = (100 - 5m)/3

Since w must be integer, 100 - 5m must be divisible by 3. Let me write that:

100 - 5m ≡ 0 mod 3 => 5m ≡ 100 mod 3

Compute 100 mod 3: 3*33=99, so 100 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore:

5m ≡ 1 mod 3 => 5 ≡ 2 mod 3, so 2m ≡ 1 mod 3 => Multiply both sides by 2 inverse mod 3. Since 2*2=4≡1 mod3, inverse of 2 is 2. Therefore:

m ≡ 2*1 ≡ 2 mod 3. So m ≡ 2 mod 3. Therefore, m can be written as 3k + 2 for some integer k ≥ 0.

Now, since m must be non-negative and also, since total people is 100, m can't be more than 100. Let's find possible values of m.

Let me try m=2: then w=(100 - 5*2)/3=(100-10)/3=90/3=30. Then c=100 -2 -30=68. Let me check if that works. 3*2 + 2*30 + 0.5*68 = 6 + 60 + 34 = 100. Yes, that works. So that's one solution: 2 men, 30 women, 68 children.

But are there other solutions? Let me check m=5: 3k + 2 =5 =>k=1. Then m=5, w=(100 -25)/3=75/3=25. Then c=100 -5 -25=70. Check: 3*5 +2*25 +0.5*70=15 +50 +35=100. Correct. So that's another solution. Wait, but the problem says "how many men, women, and children are there?" implying a unique solution? Maybe there are multiple solutions? But maybe the problem expects the one with the most men or something? Wait, but maybe I need to check if there are more solutions.

Wait, let me check m=8: m=8, which is 3*2 + 2=8. Then w=(100 - 5*8)/3=(100-40)/3=60/3=20. c=100 -8 -20=72. Check: 3*8 + 2*20 +0.5*72=24 +40 +36=100. Correct. So another solution. Similarly, m=11: 3*3 + 2=11. Then w=(100 -55)/3=45/3=15. c=100 -11 -15=74. Check: 3*11 +2*15 +0.5*74=33 +30 +37=100. Correct. So there are multiple solutions. But the problem says "how many men, women, and children are there?" Maybe there is a unique solution? Wait, maybe I need to check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says "Alcuin of York, 775." Maybe this is a classic problem with a unique solution. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, but according to my calculations, there are multiple solutions. Let me check the problem again. Maybe there is an implicit assumption that there are at least some men, women, and children? Or maybe the problem is from a source where the answer is unique. Wait, but maybe I need to check if the problem is from Alcuin's time, and maybe he had a unique solution. Wait, maybe I need to check the original problem again.

Wait, the problem says "One hundred bushels of grain are distributed among 100 persons..." So 100 people and 100 bushels. Each man gets 3, woman 2, child 0.5. So the equations are correct. So there are multiple solutions. However, maybe there is a unique solution with positive integers. Wait, but according to my calculations, there are multiple solutions. Let me check m=2, w=30, c=68; m=5, w=25, c=70; m=8, w=20, c=72; m=11, w=15, c=74; m=14, w=10, c=76; m=17, w=5, c=78; m=20, w=0, c=80. Wait, m=20, w=0, c=80. Let me check that: 3*20 + 2*0 + 0.5*80 = 60 + 0 + 40 = 100. Correct. So there are multiple solutions. However, maybe in the original problem, there is an implicit assumption that there are at least one of each? But the problem doesn't specify that. So maybe the problem is expecting all possible solutions? But the way the question is phrased: "how many men, women, and children are there?" suggests a unique answer. Maybe I need to check if there is a standard answer for this problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, let me check again. The problem says 100 persons, 100 bushels. Each man gets 3, woman 2, child 0.5. So equations:

m + w + c = 100

3m + 2w + 0.5c = 100

Multiply second equation by 2: 6m + 4w + c = 200

Now subtract first equation: (6m + 4w + c) - (m + w + c) = 200 - 100 => 5m + 3w = 100. Which is what I had before. So that is correct. So 5m + 3w = 100. So possible solutions are as above. So maybe the problem is expecting the solution with the maximum number of men? Or maybe the minimum? But since the problem is from Alcuin, maybe there is a standard answer. Wait, maybe I need to check historical sources. Wait, but since I can't do that, maybe the problem is expecting the answer with the most men? Or maybe there is a unique solution. Wait, but according to my calculations, there are multiple solutions. Wait, maybe I need to check if the problem is from a specific source. Wait, maybe the original problem had more constraints. Wait, but the problem as given here is as stated. Maybe the answer is not unique? But the problem says "how many men, women, and children are there?" implying a unique answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, let me check again. If m=2, w=30, c=68: total people 2+30+68=100. Total bushels: 2*3 + 30*2 + 68*0.5=6 + 60 + 34=100. Correct.

But maybe the problem is expecting another solution? Wait, maybe there's a unique solution if you assume that there are more women than men or something? But the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my equations. Wait, maybe the problem is different? Let me check again. The problem says "each man receives 3 bushels, each woman 2 bushels, and each child 1/2 bushel." So that's correct. So equations are correct. Therefore, maybe the problem is designed to have multiple solutions, but maybe the answer is presented as a unique solution? Wait, maybe I need to check for possible constraints. For example, maybe the number of children must be even? Because 0.5 bushels per child, but the total bushels is 100, which is an integer. So 0.5c must be integer, so c must be even. In my solutions above, c is 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80. All even numbers. So that's okay. So there are multiple solutions. However, maybe the original problem had more constraints. Wait, maybe the problem is from a source where the answer is unique, and maybe I need to check again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the answer with the maximum number of children? Or maybe the minimum number of men? But without more information, perhaps the problem is expecting one of the solutions. Wait, maybe I need to check if there's a standard answer for this problem. Wait, I recall that this is a classic problem, and the answer is usually 2 men, 30 women, and 68 children. Maybe that's the intended answer. But how can I be sure? Well, maybe the problem is from Alcuin's time, and he might have had that solution. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find it. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe there's a unique solution if we consider that the number of children is 68, but that's just one of the solutions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the answer with the most men? Let me check m=20, w=0, c=80. But that would mean no women. But maybe that's acceptable. However, since the problem mentions men, women, and children, maybe there is at least one of each? If that's the case, then m must be at least 1, w at least 1, c at least 1. Then, let's check the solutions:

For m=2, w=30, c=68: all positive.

For m=5, w=25, c=70: same.

m=8, w=20, c=72.

m=11, w=15, c=74.

m=14, w=10, c=76.

m=17, w=5, c=78.

m=20, w=0, c=80: invalid if w must be at least 1.

So if the problem requires at least one of each, then the solutions are the first six. But still multiple solutions. So maybe the problem is missing constraints? Wait, but maybe there is another way. Wait, maybe I need to check if there are more constraints. Wait, the problem says "distributed among 100 persons", so maybe the answer is unique. Maybe I made a mistake in the equations?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is from Alcuin's time, and the answer is known. Wait, I can check online... but since I can't, I need to think. Alternatively, maybe the problem is similar to the classic "three types of people" problem, which usually has a unique solution. Wait, but in this case, there are multiple solutions. Maybe the original problem had different numbers? Wait, let me check again. Wait, the problem says 100 bushels for 100 people. So 1 bushel per person on average. But each man gets 3, woman 2, child 0.5. So 3 + 2 + 0.5 = 5.5 bushels per person? Wait, no. Wait, no. The total is 100 bushels for 100 people, so average is 1 bushel per person. But each man gets 3, which is more than average, woman 2, which is more than average, and child 0.5, which is less. So the total is 100 bushels. So the equations are correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a source where the answer is unique, and maybe the answer is 2 men, 30 women, 68 children. Maybe that's the standard answer. So maybe I should go with that. Alternatively, maybe there is a unique solution if you consider that the number of children is 68, which is 68. But how?

Alternatively, maybe there is an error in my calculation. Wait, let me check again. For example, if m=2, w=30, c=68. Then total bushels: 2*3=6, 30*2=60, 68*0.5=34. 6+60+34=100. Correct. So that works. Similarly, m=5, w=25, c=70: 15 + 50 + 35=100. Correct. So both are valid. Therefore, the problem must have multiple solutions. However, the problem says "how many men, women, and children are there?" implying a unique answer. Maybe there is a mistake in the problem statement? Or maybe I need to check for other constraints.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is from Alcuin's time, and he had a unique solution. Wait, maybe I need to check the problem again. Wait, Alcuin's problem is known. Let me try to recall. I think this is a classic problem. Let me think. For example, the problem is similar to the "three types of people" problem. Let me try to think of the equations again. 5m + 3w = 100. Let me think of m and w as non-negative integers. So m can be 2,5,8,...,20. So there are multiple solutions. Therefore, the problem might have multiple answers. However, since the problem is presented as a puzzle, maybe there is a unique answer. Maybe there is a mistake in my equations? Wait, maybe I need to check again.

Wait, the problem says "one hundred bushels of grain are distributed among 100 persons". So 100 people, 100 bushels. So each person gets 1 bushel on average. But each man gets 3, which is 3 bushels, so that's 2 more than average. Each woman gets 2, which is 1 more than average. Each child gets 0.5, which is 0.5 less than average. So the total excess is 2m + 1w - 0.5c = 0. Because total bushels is 100, which is 100*1. So 3m + 2w + 0.5c = 100. Which is the same as 2m + w - 0.5c = 0. But since c = 100 - m - w, substitute:

2m + w - 0.5*(100 - m - w) = 0 => 2m + w - 50 + 0.5m + 0.5w = 0 => 2.5m + 1.5w = 50 => same as before. So that's correct. Therefore, multiple solutions. Therefore, maybe the problem is designed to have multiple solutions, but the question is phrased as if there is one. Maybe the answer is presented as multiple solutions? But since the user hasn't specified, maybe I need to check if there's a standard answer. Alternatively, maybe I need to check for the minimal number of men? Or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the answer in terms of the number of children? But since the problem is presented as a puzzle, maybe there is a unique answer. Alternatively, maybe I need to check the problem again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me try another approach. Let me think in terms of variables. Let me suppose that there are m men, w women, c children. Then:

m + w + c = 100

3m + 2w + 0.5c = 100

Multiply the second equation by 2:

6m + 4w + c = 200

Now subtract the first equation:

(6m + 4w + c) - (m + w + c) = 200 - 100 => 5m + 3w = 100. So same as before.

So 5m + 3w = 100. Let me think of possible integer solutions. Let me try m=2: 5*2=10, 100-10=90, 90/3=30. So w=30. Then c=100 -2 -30=68. So that's one solution.

m=5: 5*5=25, 100-25=75, 75/3=25. So w=25. c=100-5-25=70.

Similarly, m=8: 5*8=40, 100-40=60, 60/3=20. c=100 -8 -20=72.

So yes, multiple solutions. Therefore, unless there is more constraints, there are multiple solutions. However, since the problem is presented as a puzzle, maybe there is a unique answer. Maybe the problem is from a source where the answer is 2 men, 30 women, 68 children. Maybe that's the intended answer. So I think that's the answer they expect here.

Moving on to part (b):

**Problem (b):** Mahaviracarya, 850. There were 63 equal piles of plantain fruit put together and 7 single fruits. They were divided evenly among 23 travelers. What is the number of fruits in each pile?

Okay, so there are 63 piles, each with the same number of fruits, and 7 single fruits. Total fruits is 63p + 7, where p is the number of fruits per pile. This total is divided evenly among 23 travelers, so total fruits must be divisible by 23. Therefore:

63p + 7 ≡ 0 mod 23.

So need to solve for p in integers such that 63p + 7 is divisible by 23.

First, let me compute 63 mod 23. 23*2=46, 63-46=17. So 63 ≡17 mod23. Therefore:

17p + 7 ≡ 0 mod23 => 17p ≡ -7 mod23 => 17p ≡ 16 mod23 (since -7 +23=16).

So need to solve 17p ≡16 mod23.

To solve for p, we need the inverse of 17 mod23.

Find x such that 17x ≡1 mod23.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Find gcd(17,23):

23 = 1*17 + 6

17 = 2*6 + 5

6 = 1*5 + 1

5 = 5*1 + 0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1 = 6 - 1*5

But 5 = 17 - 2*6, so:

1 = 6 - 1*(17 - 2*6) = 3*6 - 1*17

But 6 = 23 - 1*17, so:

1 = 3*(23 - 1*17) - 1*17 = 3*23 - 4*17

Therefore, -4*17 ≡1 mod23 => inverse of 17 mod23 is -4 mod23. Since -4 +23=19. So inverse is 19.

Therefore, p ≡16 *19 mod23.

Calculate 16*19: 16*20=320, minus 16=304. Now divide 304 by 23:

23*13=299, 304-299=5. So 304 ≡5 mod23. Therefore p≡5 mod23.

So p=5 +23k, where k is integer ≥0. Since the number of fruits per pile must be positive, and since there are 63 piles, p must be such that 63p +7 is positive, which it is for p≥0. But since we are dividing among 23 travelers, the total number of fruits is 63p +7, which must be divisible by 23. But since p=5 +23k, the minimal positive solution is p=5.

Therefore, the number of fruits in each pile is 5. Let me check:

Total fruits: 63*5 +7= 315 +7=322. 322 divided by 23: 23*14=322. Yes, correct. Therefore, the answer is 5.

**Problem (c):** Yen Kung, 1372. We have an unknown number of coins. If you make 77 strings of them, you are 50 coins short; but if you make 78 strings, it is exact. How many coins are there?

So, let me parse this. Let the number of coins be N.

If you make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short. So, if each string has some number of coins, then 77 strings would be N - 50 coins? Or is it that making 77 strings requires 77 times the number of coins per string, and you are short by 50? Wait, the wording is: "If you make 77 strings of them, you are 50 coins short; but if you make 78 strings, it is exact."

So, let me think. Let me suppose that each string has k coins. Then, making 77 strings would require 77k coins, but you have N coins. So, N = 77k - 50. Because you are short by 50 coins. Alternatively, maybe it's that you need to make 77 strings, but you have 50 coins less than needed. So, the number of coins needed for 77 strings is 77k, and you have N = 77k - 50. Then, if you make 78 strings, you have exactly N = 78k. Therefore:

From the second equation, N = 78k.

From the first equation, N = 77k - 50.

Therefore:

78k = 77k - 50 => 78k -77k = -50 => k = -50. Which is impossible. Therefore, my interpretation is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the number of coins per string is different? Or maybe the number of coins per string is not fixed? Wait, the problem says "make 77 strings of them"—so "them" refers to the coins. So, making strings of coins. So, perhaps each string has the same number of coins. Let me think again.

Let me suppose that each string has x coins. Then, if you make 77 strings, you need 77x coins. But you have N coins, which is 50 coins short. Therefore, N = 77x - 50. But if you make 78 strings, it is exact, so N = 78y, where y is the number of coins per string? Wait, but if you make 78 strings, it's exact. So maybe the number of coins per string is different? Or is it the same?

Wait, the problem says "make 77 strings of them"—so "them" is the coins. So, if you make 77 strings, you need to have enough coins to make 77 strings. But you are 50 coins short. So, the total coins needed for 77 strings is 77x, and you have N coins, so N = 77x - 50. Then, when you make 78 strings, you have exactly N coins, so N = 78x. Therefore, 78x = 77x -50 => x = -50. Which is impossible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the number of coins per string is different for 77 and 78? But the problem says "make 77 strings of them"—so "them" is the coins. So maybe the number of coins per string is fixed. Therefore, the problem must be interpreted differently.

Alternatively, maybe "make 77 strings of them" means that you have to divide the coins into 77 strings, each string containing some number of coins, but you are 50 coins short. So, if you have N coins, and you try to divide them into 77 strings, each string having the same number of coins, then you would need N = 77k, but since you are 50 coins short, then N = 77k - 50. But if you make 78 strings, then N = 78k. Therefore, same as before. Which leads to k = -50. Not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that when you make 77 strings, you are short by 50 coins, meaning that you need 77 strings, but you have 50 coins less than needed. So, if you have N coins, then the number of coins needed for 77 strings is N + 50. Therefore, N + 50 = 77x. And when you make 78 strings, it is exact, so N = 78x. Therefore, substituting N = 78x into the first equation: 78x + 50 = 77x => 78x -77x = -50 => x = -50. Still impossible.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the problem is that when you make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short of the number needed for 78 strings? Wait, maybe the problem is that the number of coins is such that if you make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short of making 78 strings. So, the total coins N is such that N = 78k - 50, where k is the number of coins per string for 78 strings. But if you make 77 strings, you need 77k coins, but you have N = 78k -50. Therefore, 78k -50 = 77k => k = 50. Therefore, N = 78*50 -50 = 78*50 -50 = 50*(78 -1) = 50*77= 3850. Therefore, N=3850.

But let me check. If N=3850, then making 78 strings would require 78k = 3850. If k=50, then 78*50=3900, which is more than 3850. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe my interpretation is wrong.

Alternatively, if N is such that when you make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short, meaning that the number of coins needed for 77 strings is N + 50. And when you make 78 strings, you have exactly N coins. Therefore, the number of coins needed for 78 strings is N. Therefore, the number of coins per string for 78 strings is N /78. And for 77 strings, it would be (N +50)/77. Assuming that the number of coins per string is the same? Or different?

If the number of coins per string is the same, then:

(N +50)/77 = N /78 => cross multiply:

78(N +50) =77N => 78N + 3900 =77N => N = -3900. Which is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the number of coins per string is different. Wait, but the problem says "make 77 strings of them"—so "them" is the coins. So maybe when you make 77 strings, each string has the same number of coins, and when you make 78 strings, each string has the same number of coins. But the number of coins per string is different. So, if you have N coins, then:

If you make 77 strings, you need 77x coins, but you are 50 coins short. So, N = 77x -50.

If you make 78 strings, you have exactly N coins, so N = 78y.

Therefore, 77x -50 = 78y. But we need to find integers x and y such that this holds. However, we have two variables here. But the problem says "make 77 strings of them"—so maybe x and y are the same? Or different?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the number of coins per string is the same in both cases. So, if you have N coins, then:

If you make 77 strings, you need 77x coins, but you are 50 short. Therefore, N = 77x -50.

If you make 78 strings, you have exactly N coins, so N = 78x. Therefore, 78x = 77x -50 => x = -50. Not possible.

Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, my interpretation is wrong. Maybe the problem is that when you make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short of making 78 strings. So, the total coins needed for 78 strings is N +50. Therefore, N +50 = 78x, and N = 77x. Therefore:

N = 77x

N +50 = 78x => 77x +50 =78x => x=50. Therefore, N=77*50= 3850. Therefore, the number of coins is 3850. Let me check: if you make 77 strings, each with 50 coins, you need 77*50=3850 coins. But you have N=3850 coins. Wait, that would mean you have exactly enough for 77 strings. But the problem says you are 50 coins short. Wait, that contradicts.

Wait, if N +50 = 78x, and N = 77x. Then N +50 = 78x => 77x +50 =78x => x=50. Then N=77*50=3850. So, if you make 78 strings, you need 78*50=3900 coins. But you have only 3850, which is 50 coins short. Therefore, that's correct. So the problem says: if you make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short. Wait, but if you have N=3850 coins, and you try to make 77 strings, each with 50 coins, you need 77*50=3850 coins. So you have exactly enough. But the problem says you are 50 coins short. Therefore, my interpretation is still wrong.

Wait, maybe the problem is that when you try to make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short of what is needed for 78 strings. So, the total coins needed for 78 strings is N +50. Therefore, if you have N coins, then N +50 is the number needed for 78 strings. So, N +50 = 78x. And if you try to make 77 strings, you need 77x coins, but you have N coins, so N = 77x -50. Therefore, substituting N into the first equation: 77x -50 +50 =78x => 77x =78x => x=0. Which is impossible. So no solution.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that when you make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short of making 77 strings. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the number of coins is such that if you divide them into 77 strings, each string has some number of coins, and you are 50 coins short of having enough to make 78 strings. Wait, this is too vague. Maybe I need to think of it as a Diophantine equation.

Let me think again. Let me denote the number of coins as N. Let me suppose that when you try to make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short. So, the total number of coins needed for 77 strings is N +50. Therefore, N +50 = 77x, where x is the number of coins per string. When you make 78 strings, it is exact, so N = 78y, where y is the number of coins per string for 78 strings. But if the number of coins per string is the same, then x = y. Therefore, N +50 =77y and N =78y. Then, substituting N =78y into the first equation: 78y +50 =77y => y = -50. Not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the number of coins per string is different. Let me suppose that when you make 77 strings, each string has x coins, and when you make 78 strings, each string has y coins. Then:

N = 77x -50 (since you are 50 short for 77 strings)

N = 78y (exact for 78 strings)

Therefore, 77x -50 = 78y. We need to find integers x and y such that this holds. But there are infinitely many solutions. However, the problem probably expects the minimal positive solution.

But how do we find x and y? Since we don't have more equations, maybe we need to assume that the number of coins per string is the same? But that leads to a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the number of coins per string is the same, and the difference between 78 strings and 77 strings is 50 coins. So, 78x -77x = x = 50. Therefore, x=50. Therefore, N =78x -50 =78*50 -50= 50*(78 -1)= 50*77= 3850. Therefore, N=3850. Then, if you make 77 strings, you need 77*50=3850 coins, but you are 50 coins short. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If you have N=3850 coins, then making 77 strings of 50 coins each would require exactly 3850 coins. So you are not short. But the problem says you are 50 coins short. Therefore, this is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that when you make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short of making 78 strings. So, the total coins needed for 78 strings is N +50. Therefore, N +50 = 78x, and N = 77x -50. Therefore, substituting N into the first equation:

77x -50 +50 =78x => 77x =78x => x=0. Not possible.

This is very confusing. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me think of the problem as:

Let N be the number of coins. When you make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short. So, if you had 50 more coins, you could make 77 strings. When you make 78 strings, you have exactly enough. So, the number of coins needed for 78 strings is N +50. Therefore, N +50 = 78k, where k is the number of coins per string. Also, the number of coins needed for 77 strings is N +50 + something? Wait, no. If you have N coins, and you are 50 short to make 77 strings, then the number of coins needed for 77 strings is N +50. Therefore, if you have N coins, and you want to make 77 strings, you need N +50 coins. Therefore, the number of coins per string is (N +50)/77. When you make 78 strings, you have exactly N coins, so N = 78 * (N +50)/77. Therefore:

N = (78/77)(N +50)

Multiply both sides by 77:

77N = 78N + 78*50

=> -N = 3900

=> N = -3900. Which is impossible.

This is not working. Maybe there's a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is that when you make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short of making 77 strings. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that when you make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short of making 78 strings. So, the total number of coins is such that 77 strings require N coins, and 78 strings require N +50 coins. Therefore:

If you have N coins, then making 77 strings requires N coins, but you are 50 coins short of making 78 strings, which would require N +50 coins. Therefore, the number of coins per string for 78 strings is (N +50)/78. But if the number of coins per string is the same for both, then:

N /77 = (N +50)/78 => 78N =77N + 3900 => N=3900. Therefore, N=3900.

Let me check: if N=3900, then making 77 strings would require 3900 coins, so each string has 3900/77 ≈50.649 coins. But if you make 78 strings, you need N +50 = 3950 coins. Therefore, each string would have 3950/78 ≈50.641 coins. Not the same. So the number of coins per string is different. But the problem says "make 77 strings of them"—so maybe the number of coins per string is the same? If so, then the above equation would require that N /77 = (N +50)/78 => N=3900. But then the number of coins per string would be 3900/77 ≈50.649, which is not an integer. But the problem says "make 77 strings of them"—so maybe the number of coins per string is an integer. Therefore, this suggests that my interpretation is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the number of coins is such that when you divide them into 77 strings, each string has some number of coins, and you are 50 coins short of making 78 strings. So, if you have N coins, then dividing into 77 strings gives you some number of coins per string, but you are 50 coins short of making 78 strings. This is too vague.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is similar to the classic "I have some coins. If I make 77 strings, I am 50 short; if I make 78 strings, it is exact." So, the number of coins is such that 78 strings is exact, but 77 strings is short by 50. Therefore, the number of coins is equal to 78k, and 77k - 50 = 78k => -50 = k, which is impossible. Wait, no. If N = 78k, then making 77 strings would require 77k coins. But you have N =78k coins. Therefore, you have 78k -77k =k coins extra. But the problem says you are 50 coins short. So, maybe the other way: N =77k -50, and N =78k. Then, 77k -50 =78k => -50 =k. Not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the number of coins per string is different. Let me think: if you make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short. So, the total coins needed for 77 strings is N +50. If you make 78 strings, it is exact. So, the total coins needed for 78 strings is N. Therefore:

N +50 = 77x (total coins needed for 77 strings)

N = 78y (total coins needed for 78 strings)

But we don't know x and y. However, if we assume that the number of coins per string is the same for both cases, then x = y. Therefore, N +50 =77y and N =78y => N +50 =77y =78y -50 => 77y =78y -50 => y=50. Therefore, N=78*50=3900. Then, total coins needed for 77 strings is 3900 +50=3950 =77x => x=3950/77=51.3... Not integer. So this is not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the number of coins per string is different. Let me think of it as a Diophantine equation. Let me denote that when you make 77 strings, you are 50 coins short. So, the total coins needed for 77 strings is N +50. When you make 78 strings, it is exact, so N = 78y. Also, the total coins needed for 77 strings is 77x. So, 77x = N +50. Therefore:

77x = 78y +50.

We need to find integers x and y such that this equation holds. Let me rearrange:

77x -78y =50.

This is a linear Diophantine equation. Let me solve for x and y.

First, find gcd(77,78). Since 78 -77=1, gcd is 1.
