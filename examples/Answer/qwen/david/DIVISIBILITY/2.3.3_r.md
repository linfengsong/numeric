Okay, so I need to figure out whether the statement "If a divides (b + c), then either a divides b or a divides c" is true or false. Let me start by recalling what it means for one number to divide another. If a divides b, that means there's some integer k such that b = a*k. Similarly for c. 

The statement is saying that if a divides the sum of b and c, then a must divide at least one of them. Hmm. Let me think of some examples to test this. 

First, let me take a simple case where a is 2, b is 2, and c is 2. Then b + c is 4, and 2 divides 4. Also, 2 divides both b and c. So in this case, the statement holds. 

Another example: Let a = 3, b = 3, c = 3. Then b + c = 6, which is divisible by 3, and 3 divides both b and c. Still holds. 

But maybe there's a case where a divides b + c but doesn't divide either b or c. Let me try to find such numbers. 

How about a = 2, b = 1, c = 1. Then b + c = 2, which is divisible by 2. However, 2 does not divide 1 or 1. So here, the statement would be false. Wait, so in this case, a divides b + c, but neither a divides b nor a divides c. Therefore, the original statement is false? 

But wait, let me check again. If a = 2, b = 1, c = 1. Then 2 divides 1 + 1 = 2. But 2 does not divide 1. So this is a counterexample. Therefore, the statement is false. 

But wait, maybe I need to check if the original statement is about integers? The problem didn't specify, but usually in number theory, divisibility is considered for integers. So assuming a, b, c are integers. 

But let me think again. Maybe there's a condition I missed? The problem says "If a | (b + c), then either a | b or a | c." But in my example, a divides b + c but not either b or c. Therefore, the implication is false. Therefore, the statement is false. 

But maybe there's something wrong with my example? Let me check again. If a = 2, b = 1, c = 1. Then 2 divides 2, which is true. But 2 does not divide 1. So yes, that's a valid counterexample. Therefore, the original statement is false. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the context of positive integers? But even so, the example still holds. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in modular arithmetic? For example, if a divides b + c, then in modulo a, b + c ≡ 0. So that would mean that b ≡ -c mod a. So that would mean that b ≡ -c mod a. Which would mean that if you have b ≡ -c mod a, then it's possible that neither b nor c is congruent to 0 mod a. For example, if a = 2, b = 1, c = 1, then 1 + 1 = 2 ≡ 0 mod 2, but neither 1 ≡ 0 mod 2 nor 1 ≡ 0 mod 2. 

So that seems to confirm that the statement is false. Therefore, the answer should be that the statement is false, and we can disprove it with a counterexample. 

Wait, but maybe there are some constraints? For example, if a, b, c are positive integers? But even then, the example still works. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the case where a is 1? Because 1 divides everything. So if a = 1, then 1 divides (b + c), which is always true. Then the statement would say that either 1 divides b or 1 divides c. But since 1 divides every integer, that's true. So in that case, the statement holds. But in other cases, like when a is 2, it doesn't hold. 

Therefore, the original statement is not always true. Therefore, it's false. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the case where a, b, c are positive integers? But even then, the example with a = 2, b = 1, c = 1 is valid. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to check if the problem has some other constraints? The problem says "If a | (b + c), then either a | b or a | c." So it's a general statement. 

Therefore, since there exists a case where the implication is false, the statement is false. Therefore, we can disprove it. 

But let me think again. Maybe there's a different way to approach this. Suppose that a divides b + c. So, b + c = a*k for some integer k. Then, if we want to show that either a divides b or a divides c, but that's not necessarily true. 

Suppose that a divides b + c, but not b or c. Then, that would mean that b ≡ -c mod a. So, for example, if b ≡ 1 mod a and c ≡ -1 mod a, then their sum is 0 mod a. 

So, for example, if a is 2, then b = 1 mod 2, c = 1 mod 2, then their sum is 0 mod 2. Therefore, this is a case where a divides b + c, but neither a divides b nor a divides c. 

Therefore, the original statement is false. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the case where a, b, c are positive integers? But even then, the example works. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the case where a is a prime number? But even for prime numbers, say a = 3, b = 1, c = 2. Then b + c = 3, which is divisible by 3. But 3 does not divide 1 or 2. Therefore, again, the statement is false. 

Therefore, regardless of the value of a (as long as it's not 1, which is a special case), there are cases where the implication fails. 

Therefore, the original statement is false. 

But wait, let me check another example. Let me take a = 4, b = 2, c = 2. Then b + c = 4, which is divisible by 4. But 4 divides 2? No, 4 does not divide 2. So again, this is a counterexample. 

Alternatively, a = 5, b = 2, c = 3. Then b + c = 5, which is divisible by 5. But 5 does not divide 2 or 3. 

Therefore, this seems to confirm that the statement is false. 

Therefore, the answer should be that the statement is false, and we can disprove it with counterexamples. 

But wait, maybe there's a special case where the statement is true? For example, if a is 1, then 1 divides everything, so the statement is true. But if a is greater than 1, then there are cases where the statement is false. Therefore, the original statement is not always true. 

Therefore, the correct answer is that the statement is false. 

But let me check once more. Suppose that a divides b + c. Then, does that imply that a divides b or a divides c? 

Suppose that a divides b + c. Then, b + c = a*k. 

If a divides b, then b = a*m. Then, substituting into the equation, a*m + c = a*k => c = a*(k - m). Therefore, a divides c. 

Similarly, if a divides c, then c = a*m, then b + a*m = a*k => b = a*(k - m). Therefore, a divides b. 

But the converse is not necessarily true. That is, if a divides b + c, it doesn't necessarily mean that a divides b or a divides c. 

Therefore, the original statement is not true. 

Therefore, the answer is that the statement is false. 

So, in conclusion, the statement is false because there exist integers a, b, c where a divides b + c but a does not divide b or c. For example, a = 2, b = 1, c = 1. 

Therefore, the original statement is disproven.

To determine the truth value of the statement:

> **"If $ a \mid (b + c) $, then either $ a \mid b $ or $ a \mid c $."**

we begin by analyzing what the condition $ a \mid (b + c) $ implies. This means that there exists some integer $ k $ such that:

$$
b + c = a \cdot k
$$

The statement claims that under this condition, it must be the case that **either** $ a \mid b $ **or** $ a \mid c $. In other words, it claims that if $ a $ divides the sum $ b + c $, then it must divide at least one of the terms $ b $ or $ c $.

### Step 1: Consider a Counterexample

Let’s test whether this implication is always true by finding a counterexample.

Take:
- $ a = 2 $
- $ b = 1 $
- $ c = 1 $

Then:
$$
b + c = 1 + 1 = 2
$$
and clearly $ 2 \mid 2 $, so the condition $ a \mid (b + c) $ is satisfied.

However:
- $ 2 \nmid 1 $, and
- $ 2 \nmid 1 $

So, in this case, $ a \mid (b + c) $ is true, but **neither** $ a \mid b $ **nor** $ a \mid c $ is true.

This directly contradicts the statement.

### Step 2: General Reasoning

Suppose $ a \mid (b + c) $. Then, $ b + c = a \cdot k $ for some integer $ k $. This does **not** imply that $ a \mid b $ or $ a \mid c $, as we can have:

- $ b \equiv -c \mod a $, which is equivalent to $ b + c \equiv 0 \mod a $, but neither $ b \equiv 0 \mod a $ nor $ c \equiv 0 \mod a $.

For example, take $ a = 3 $, $ b = 1 $, $ c = 2 $. Then $ b + c = 3 $, so $ a \mid (b + c) $, but $ a \nmid b $ and $ a \nmid c $.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion

The original statement is **not always true**. There are cases where $ a \mid (b + c) $, but $ a $ does not divide $ b $ or $ c $. Therefore, the implication is **false**.
