Okay, so I need to prove that the nth pentagonal number p_n is equal to n(3n - 1)/2 for all n ≥ 1. The problem gives me a recursive formula: p_1 = 1 and p_n = p_{n-1} + (3n - 2) for n ≥ 2. Let me start by understanding what pentagonal numbers are and how they're being defined here.

First, the examples given are 1, 5, 12, 22, etc. Let me check if these numbers fit the formula n(3n - 1)/2. For n=1: 1*(3*1 - 1)/2 = 1*2/2 = 1, which matches. For n=2: 2*(6 - 1)/2 = 2*5/2 = 5, which is correct. For n=3: 3*(9 - 1)/2 = 3*8/2 = 12, yes. n=4: 4*(12 - 1)/2 = 4*11/2 = 22. Perfect, so the formula works for the given examples. But I need to prove it for all n ≥ 1 using the recursive definition.

So the problem is to prove that p_n = n(3n - 1)/2 given the recursive formula. Let me recall that to prove such formulas, mathematical induction is a common method. Let me try that approach.

First, check the base case. For n=1, p_1 = 1, and the formula gives 1*(3*1 -1)/2 = 1*2/2 = 1. So the base case holds.

Now, assume that for some integer k ≥ 1, the formula holds for n=k, i.e., p_k = k(3k - 1)/2. Now I need to show that it holds for n=k+1. According to the recursive formula, p_{k+1} = p_k + (3(k+1) - 2) = p_k + 3k + 3 - 2 = p_k + 3k + 1.

So substituting the inductive hypothesis into this, p_{k+1} = [k(3k - 1)/2] + 3k + 1. Let me compute this expression:

First, expand the terms:

[k(3k - 1)/2] + 3k + 1 = [ (3k² - k)/2 ] + 3k + 1.

To combine these terms, I need a common denominator. Let me rewrite 3k as 6k/2 and 1 as 2/2:

= (3k² - k)/2 + 6k/2 + 2/2

Combine the numerators:

[3k² - k + 6k + 2]/2 = [3k² + 5k + 2]/2.

Now, I need to check if this equals (k+1)(3(k+1) - 1)/2. Let's compute the right-hand side:

(k+1)(3k + 3 - 1)/2 = (k+1)(3k + 2)/2.

Multiply out (k+1)(3k + 2):

= k*(3k + 2) + 1*(3k + 2) = 3k² + 2k + 3k + 2 = 3k² + 5k + 2.

Which is exactly the numerator we had earlier. Therefore, [3k² + 5k + 2]/2 equals (k+1)(3k + 2)/2. Therefore, p_{k+1} equals the formula for n=k+1. Hence, by induction, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1.

Wait, that seems to work. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with p_{k+1} = p_k + 3k + 1. Then substituting p_k as k(3k - 1)/2. Then expanding that term, adding 3k + 1. Then converting to common denominators. Then combining terms. Then expanding the formula for n=k+1. Then verifying that both sides are equal. Yes, seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can try another approach, like solving the recurrence relation directly. Let me try that as a check.

The recurrence is p_n = p_{n-1} + 3n - 2, with p_1 = 1.

This is a linear recurrence. To solve it, we can expand the recurrence:

p_n = p_{n-1} + 3n - 2

= p_{n-2} + 3(n-1) - 2 + 3n - 2

= p_{n-2} + 3(n-1) + 3n - 4

Continuing this way, expanding all the way to p_1:

p_n = p_1 + Σ_{k=2}^n [3k - 2]

Since p_1 = 1, then:

p_n = 1 + Σ_{k=2}^n (3k - 2)

But Σ_{k=2}^n (3k - 2) = Σ_{k=1}^n (3k - 2) - (3*1 - 2) = Σ_{k=1}^n (3k - 2) - 1

So p_n = 1 + [Σ_{k=1}^n (3k - 2) - 1] = Σ_{k=1}^n (3k - 2)

Therefore, p_n = Σ_{k=1}^n (3k - 2). Let me compute this sum.

Σ_{k=1}^n (3k - 2) = 3 Σ_{k=1}^n k - 2 Σ_{k=1}^n 1 = 3*(n(n+1)/2) - 2n = (3n(n+1)/2) - 2n.

Simplify this expression:

= (3n² + 3n)/2 - 2n = (3n² + 3n - 4n)/2 = (3n² - n)/2 = n(3n - 1)/2.

Which is exactly the formula we needed to prove. Therefore, this method also works. So whether by induction or by solving the recurrence, we arrive at the formula. Hence, the formula is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the pentagonal numbers geometrically. The problem mentions that they represent the number of dots arranged evenly in a pentagon. Maybe there's a way to visualize how adding each layer adds 3n - 2 dots? But since the problem already gives the recurrence relation, perhaps the algebraic methods are sufficient.

But since I already have two methods confirming the formula, induction and solving the recurrence, I think that's solid. However, just to make sure, let me test with n=5.

Using the formula: 5*(15 - 1)/2 = 5*14/2 = 35. Let me compute p_5 using the recurrence:

p_1 = 1

p_2 = 1 + 3*2 - 2 = 1 + 6 - 2 = 5

p_3 = 5 + 3*3 - 2 = 5 + 9 - 2 = 12

p_4 = 12 + 3*4 - 2 = 12 + 12 - 2 = 22

p_5 = 22 + 3*5 - 2 = 22 + 15 - 2 = 35. Which matches the formula. So that works.

Another check: n=6. Formula: 6*(18 - 1)/2 = 6*17/2 = 51. Using recurrence:

p_5 = 35

p_6 = 35 + 3*6 - 2 = 35 + 18 - 2 = 51. Correct.

So the formula holds for these values. Therefore, the proof seems valid.

Alternatively, if I were to use mathematical induction again, let me recapitulate:

Base case n=1: holds.

Inductive step: Assume p_k = k(3k - 1)/2. Then p_{k+1} = p_k + 3k + 1 = [k(3k - 1)/2] + 3k + 1. Then compute that expression:

Multiply out:

k(3k - 1)/2 + 3k + 1 = (3k² - k)/2 + 3k + 1.

Convert 3k to 6k/2 and 1 to 2/2:

(3k² - k + 6k + 2)/2 = (3k² + 5k + 2)/2.

Factor numerator:

Looking for factors of 3k² + 5k + 2. Let me try to factor it. Multiply 3*2=6. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5. That would be 2 and 3. So split the middle term:

3k² + 2k + 3k + 2 = k(3k + 2) + 1(3k + 2) = (k + 1)(3k + 2). Therefore, the numerator factors as (k + 1)(3k + 2), so the expression is (k + 1)(3k + 2)/2, which is exactly the formula for n = k + 1: (k + 1)(3(k + 1) - 1)/2 = (k + 1)(3k + 3 - 1)/2 = (k + 1)(3k + 2)/2. Hence, proved.

Therefore, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1.

Another way to think about it is that the recurrence is a linear recurrence, and solving it gives the formula. Since the recurrence is p_n - p_{n-1} = 3n - 2, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is constant, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a quadratic function, since the nonhomogeneous term is linear. Let me try that approach.

Assume that p_n is a quadratic function of n: p_n = An² + Bn + C. Then p_n - p_{n-1} = A(n² - (n - 1)²) + B(n - (n - 1)) + (C - C) = A(2n - 1) + B(1) = 2An - A + B.

According to the recurrence, this should equal 3n - 2. Therefore:

2An - A + B = 3n - 2.

Equate coefficients:

For n term: 2A = 3 ⇒ A = 3/2.

For constants: -A + B = -2 ⇒ -3/2 + B = -2 ⇒ B = -2 + 3/2 = -1/2.

Therefore, the particular solution is p_n = (3/2)n² - (1/2)n + C. However, since the recurrence is nonhomogeneous, and we have a particular solution, but the homogeneous solution is a constant. However, since the original recurrence is p_n - p_{n-1} = 3n - 2, the general solution is the particular solution plus the homogeneous solution. However, since the homogeneous equation is p_n - p_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution p_n = D, a constant. However, in our case, the particular solution already includes the constant term C. However, since the recurrence is valid for n ≥ 2, and we have initial condition p_1 = 1, we can determine C.

But wait, actually, the general solution is p_n = (3/2)n² - (1/2)n + D. However, since the recurrence is valid for n ≥ 2, and we need to determine D using the initial condition. Wait, but when n=1, p_1 = 1. Let me plug n=1 into the general solution:

p_1 = (3/2)(1)^2 - (1/2)(1) + D = 3/2 - 1/2 + D = 1 + D. But p_1 is given as 1, so 1 + D = 1 ⇒ D = 0. Therefore, the general solution is p_n = (3/2)n² - (1/2)n = (3n² - n)/2 = n(3n - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula we need to prove. Therefore, this method also confirms the formula.

So multiple approaches: induction, solving the recurrence by expanding, solving the recurrence by assuming a quadratic function, all lead to the same formula. Therefore, the formula p_n = n(3n - 1)/2 is indeed correct.

Therefore, the proof is complete.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{n(3n - 1)}{2}}
</think>

To prove that the $ n $-th pentagonal number $ p_n $ is given by the formula

$$
p_n = \frac{n(3n - 1)}{2}
$$

for all $ n \geq 1 $, we are given the recursive definition:

- $ p_1 = 1 $
- $ p_n = p_{n-1} + (3n - 2) $ for $ n \geq 2 $

---

### **Step 1: Base Case**

We first verify the formula for $ n = 1 $:

$$
p_1 = \frac{1(3 \cdot 1 - 1)}{2} = \frac{1 \cdot 2}{2} = 1
$$

This matches the given value, so the base case holds.

---

### **Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**

Assume that the formula holds for some integer $ k \geq 1 $, i.e.,

$$
p_k = \frac{k(3k - 1)}{2}
$$

We aim to show that it also holds for $ k + 1 $.

---

### **Step 3: Inductive Step**

Using the recurrence:

$$
p_{k+1} = p_k + (3(k+1) - 2) = p_k + 3k + 1
$$

Substitute the inductive hypothesis:

$$
p_{k+1} = \frac{k(3k - 1)}{2} + 3k + 1
$$

Now, compute the right-hand side:

$$
\frac{k(3k - 1)}{2} + 3k + 1 = \frac{3k^2 - k}{2} + 3k + 1
$$

To combine terms, express $ 3k $ and $ 1 $ with a common denominator of 2:

$$
= \frac{3k^2 - k}{2} + \frac{6k}{2} + \frac{2}{2} = \frac{3k^2 - k + 6k + 2}{2} = \frac{3k^2 + 5k + 2}{2}
$$

Now factor the numerator:

$$
3k^2 + 5k + 2 = (k + 1)(3k + 2)
$$

So,

$$
p_{k+1} = \frac{(k + 1)(3k + 2)}{2}
$$

This is the formula for $ p_{k+1} $, as required.

---

### **Step 4: Conclusion**

By mathematical induction, the formula

$$
p_n = \frac{n(3n - 1)}{2}
$$

holds for all $ n \geq 1 $.

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\dfrac{n(3n - 1)}{2}}
$$
