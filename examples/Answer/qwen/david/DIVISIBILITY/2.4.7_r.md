Okay, so I need to verify that for nonzero integers a and b, the three conditions (a) a divides b, (b) the greatest common divisor of a and b is equal to the absolute value of a, and (c) the least common multiple of a and b is equal to the absolute value of b are all equivalent. That means I have to show that if one of these is true, then the others must also be true, and vice versa. Let me start by recalling what each of these terms mean.

First, divisibility: If a divides b, written as a | b, that means there exists some integer k such that b = a * k. So, b is a multiple of a. For example, 2 divides 6 because 6 = 2 * 3.

Next, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b. The absolute value of a is |a|, so condition (b) says that the gcd is equal to |a|. Since gcd is always positive, this makes sense because |a| is positive.

The least common multiple (lcm) of a and b is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both a and b. Condition (c) says that the lcm is equal to |b|. Again, since lcm is positive, this is valid.

So, I need to show that (a) implies (b), (b) implies (c), (c) implies (a), and also that (a) implies (c), (b) implies (a), etc. But since they are all equivalent, maybe I can show that (a) implies (b) implies (c) implies (a), which would establish equivalence.

Let me start with (a) implying (b). If a divides b, then there exists an integer k such that b = a * k. Let me compute gcd(a, b). Since b is a multiple of a, then a divides b, so the gcd of a and b should be a. But wait, gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor. If a divides b, then the divisors of a are also divisors of b. Therefore, the greatest common divisor should be a. However, the problem states that gcd(a, b) = |a|. But since a is a nonzero integer, |a| is the absolute value. However, gcd is always positive, so if a is negative, then |a| is positive. However, gcd(a, b) is defined as the positive integer, so even if a is negative, gcd(a, b) is the same as gcd(|a|, |b|). Therefore, if a divides b, then gcd(a, b) = |a|. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, suppose a is negative. Let me take an example. Let a = -2 and b = 4. Then a divides b because 4 = (-2)*(-2). The gcd of -2 and 4 is 2, which is |a|. So yes, in that case, gcd(a, b) = |a|. Similarly, if a is positive, say a = 2 and b = 4, then gcd(2, 4) = 2 = |a|. Therefore, in general, if a divides b, then gcd(a, b) is |a|. Therefore, (a) implies (b). That seems straightforward.

Now, moving on to (b) implying (c). So if gcd(a, b) = |a|, then we need to show that lcm(a, b) = |b|. Let me recall the relationship between gcd and lcm. For any two integers a and b, the product of gcd(a, b) and lcm(a, b) is equal to the product of a and b. That is, gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = |a * b|. Wait, actually, the formula is gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = |a * b|. But since we are dealing with integers, the absolute value is important here.

So if gcd(a, b) = |a|, then substituting into the formula:

|a| * lcm(a, b) = |a * b|

Therefore, lcm(a, b) = |a * b| / |a| = |b|. Because |a * b| divided by |a| is |b|. Therefore, lcm(a, b) = |b|. Therefore, (b) implies (c). That seems to work.

Now, moving on to (c) implying (a). If lcm(a, b) = |b|, then we need to show that a divides b. Let me think. The lcm of a and b is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both a and b. If the lcm is |b|, then |b| is a multiple of both a and b. Since |b| is a multiple of b, that's trivial. But |b| is also a multiple of a. Therefore, a divides |b|. But since a is an integer, and |b| is non-negative, then a divides |b|. However, we need to show that a divides b. Wait, but if a divides |b|, then a divides b or a divides -b. But since a divides |b|, then a divides b if a divides |b|. Wait, but if a divides |b|, then a divides b or a divides -b. But since b is an integer, if a divides |b|, then a divides b. Because if a divides |b|, then there exists an integer k such that |b| = a * k. Therefore, b = ±a * k. Therefore, a divides b. Therefore, if lcm(a, b) = |b|, then a divides b. Therefore, (c) implies (a). 

But wait, let me check with an example. Suppose a = -2 and b = 4. Then lcm(-2, 4) is 4, which is |b|. And indeed, -2 divides 4. Another example: a = 3 and b = 6. Then lcm(3, 6) = 6 = |b|. And 3 divides 6. If a = 2 and b = -4, then lcm(2, -4) is 4, which is |b|. And 2 divides -4. So that works. What if a = 2 and b = 3? Then lcm(2, 3) is 6. But |b| is 3. So 6 ≠ 3, so that case doesn't satisfy (c). So if (c) holds, then a divides b. Therefore, that seems to check out.

But let me think again. Suppose that lcm(a, b) = |b|. Then since lcm(a, b) is a multiple of a, then |b| is a multiple of a. Therefore, a divides |b|. Which implies that a divides b or a divides -b. But since b is an integer, if a divides |b|, then a divides b. Because if a divides |b|, then there exists integer k such that |b| = a * k. Then b = ±a * k. Therefore, a divides b. Therefore, yes, (c) implies (a). Therefore, that seems okay.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more direct way. Since lcm(a, b) is the least common multiple. If lcm(a, b) is equal to |b|, then |b| is the least common multiple. Therefore, |b| must be a multiple of both a and b. Since |b| is a multiple of b, that's trivial. But |b| is also a multiple of a. Therefore, a divides |b|. Therefore, a divides b or a divides -b. But since b is an integer, if a divides |b|, then a divides b. Therefore, that's the conclusion.

So, that seems okay.

Now, let me check if there are any edge cases. For example, if a is negative. Let me take a = -3 and b = 6. Then a divides b because 6 = (-3)*(-2). The gcd of -3 and 6 is 3, which is |a|. The lcm of -3 and 6 is 6, which is |b|. So that works. Another case: a = -3 and b = -6. Then a divides b because -6 = (-3)*2. gcd(-3, -6) is 3 = |a|. lcm(-3, -6) is 6 = |b|. So that works. If a is positive, say a = 3 and b = -6. Then a divides b. gcd(3, -6) is 3 = |a|. lcm(3, -6) is 6 = |b|. So that works.

Another case: suppose a = 2 and b = 2. Then a divides b. gcd(2, 2) is 2 = |a|. lcm(2, 2) is 2 = |b|. So that works. If a = 1 and b = 5. Then a divides b. gcd(1, 5) is 1 = |a|. lcm(1, 5) is 5 = |b|. So that works.

What if a = 4 and b = 8? Then a divides b. gcd(4, 8) is 4 = |a|. lcm(4, 8) is 8 = |b|. So that works.

Now, let me check if there is a case where (b) is true but (a) is not. Suppose that gcd(a, b) = |a|. Then, if a divides b, then that's true. But suppose that a does not divide b. Is there such a case? Let me think. Suppose a is 2 and b is 4. Then gcd(2,4) is 2 = |a|, and a divides b. But if I take a = 2 and b = 6. Then gcd(2,6) is 2 = |a|, and a divides b. So maybe there is no case where gcd(a,b) = |a| and a does not divide b? Wait, because if gcd(a, b) is |a|, then that would mean that |a| is the greatest common divisor. So, since |a| divides a, and |a| divides b, then |a| divides both a and b. Therefore, since |a| divides a, then a divides |a|? Wait, no. Wait, if |a| divides a, then a is a multiple of |a|. But since |a| is the absolute value of a, then a is either |a| or -|a|. Therefore, if |a| divides a, then a must be a multiple of |a|. Which is only possible if a is ±|a|. Therefore, if |a| divides a, then a is ±|a|. Therefore, if |a| divides b, then b is a multiple of |a|. But since a is ±|a|, then if b is a multiple of |a|, then b is a multiple of a. Because if a is positive, then b is a multiple of a. If a is negative, then b is a multiple of |a|, which is the same as a multiple of -a. Therefore, if b is a multiple of |a|, then b is a multiple of a. Therefore, if gcd(a, b) = |a|, then a divides b. Therefore, (b) implies (a). Therefore, that shows that (b) implies (a). Therefore, that seems to check out.

Alternatively, suppose that gcd(a, b) = |a|. Then since gcd(a, b) divides both a and b, then |a| divides a and |a| divides b. Since |a| divides a, that's true because |a| is the absolute value of a. Therefore, |a| divides b. Therefore, b is a multiple of |a|. Therefore, b = |a| * k for some integer k. Therefore, if a is positive, then a divides b. If a is negative, then a = -|a|, so b = |a| * k, so b = -a * k. Therefore, a divides b. Therefore, in either case, a divides b. Therefore, (b) implies (a). Therefore, that's correct.

Similarly, for (c) implying (a), we saw that if lcm(a, b) = |b|, then |b| is a multiple of a, so a divides |b|, hence a divides b. Therefore, that's also correct.

Therefore, all the implications hold. Therefore, the three conditions are equivalent.

But let me check another way. Let me try to show that (a) implies (b), (b) implies (c), (c) implies (a). Therefore, since (a) implies (b), and (b) implies (c), and (c) implies (a), then they are all equivalent.

Alternatively, maybe I can show that (a) is equivalent to (b) and (c), but since they are all equivalent, it's sufficient to show that each implies the next.

Alternatively, maybe I can check that (a) is equivalent to (b) and (c) separately. But since they are all equivalent, it's sufficient to show that (a) implies (b), (b) implies (c), and (c) implies (a). Which we have done.

But let me check if there is a case where (b) is true but (c) is not. Suppose that gcd(a, b) = |a|. Then, from the formula, gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = |a * b|. Therefore, |a| * lcm(a, b) = |a * b|. Therefore, lcm(a, b) = |a * b| / |a| = |b|. Therefore, that shows that (b) implies (c). Therefore, there is no case where (b) is true but (c) is not. Similarly, (c) implies (a) as we saw.

Alternatively, if (c) is true, then lcm(a, b) = |b|. Then, since lcm(a, b) is the least common multiple, then |b| must be a multiple of a. Therefore, a divides |b|, which implies a divides b. Therefore, that's the case.

Therefore, all conditions are equivalent.

Wait, but let me check if there's a case where (a) is true but (b) or (c) is not. Suppose a divides b. Then, gcd(a, b) = |a|. Is that always true? For example, take a = 2, b = 4. Then gcd(2, 4) = 2 = |a|. If a = 2, b = 6, gcd(2, 6) = 2 = |a|. If a = -2, b = 4, gcd(-2, 4) = 2 = |a|. If a = -2, b = -4, gcd(-2, -4) = 2 = |a|. So that works. What if a = 3, b = 6? gcd(3, 6) = 3 = |a|. So that works. What if a = 1, b = 5? gcd(1, 5) = 1 = |a|. So that works. So seems like if a divides b, then gcd(a, b) is |a|. Therefore, (a) implies (b). Therefore, that seems to hold.

Another case: suppose a = 4, b = 8. Then gcd(4, 8) = 4 = |a|. So that works. If a = 4, b = 12, gcd(4, 12) = 4 = |a|. So yes.

Therefore, all of these cases check out. Therefore, the three conditions are equivalent.

Therefore, the answer is that all three conditions are equivalent, and thus the problem is verified.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{a} divides $ b $, \boxed{b} is equivalent to \boxed{c}, and all are equivalent. However, since the question asks to verify the equivalence and the final answer should be in boxed notation, but the original question is to verify that (a), (b), and (c) are equivalent. However, the instructions say to put the final answer within \boxed{}.

But since the problem says "verify that the following conditions are equivalent", and the user might expect a confirmation that they are equivalent, but in the context of the problem, perhaps the answer is just stating that they are equivalent, but since the original problem is in Chinese maybe? Wait, no, the original problem is in English.

But the user says "verify that the following conditions are equivalent" and to put the final answer within \boxed{}.

But in the instructions, maybe the user expects that the answer is that all three are equivalent, but since they are three conditions, perhaps the answer is that they are equivalent, so maybe the answer is simply stating that they are equivalent, but in the format of boxed. However, since the original problem is about verifying equivalence, perhaps the answer is that all three are equivalent, so maybe the answer is \boxed{a}, \boxed{b}, and \boxed{c} are equivalent. But since the user might expect a single boxed answer. However, the original problem is in Chinese maybe? No, the original problem is in English. Wait, the user wrote:

"For nonzero integers a and b, verify that the following conditions are equivalent:
(a) a | b.
(b) gcd(a, b) = |a|.
(c) lcm(a, b) = |b|."

So, the user is asking to verify that these three conditions are equivalent. The answer is that they are equivalent. However, in the context of the problem, since the user might expect that the answer is confirming that they are equivalent. However, in the instructions, the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Since the problem is about verifying equivalence, maybe the answer is that they are equivalent, so perhaps the answer is simply stating that they are equivalent, but how to box that? Maybe the answer is that all three are equivalent, so maybe the answer is \boxed{a}, \boxed{b}, \boxed{c} are equivalent. But since the user might have a specific answer in mind, perhaps the answer is that they are equivalent, so the final answer is that they are equivalent, but since the user might expect a box, maybe the answer is simply \boxed{a} divides $ b $, but that is condition (a). Alternatively, since the question is to verify equivalence, maybe the answer is that they are equivalent, so the answer is \boxed{\text{All conditions are equivalent}}. However, in standard math problems, sometimes when you have to verify equivalence, you might just say that they are equivalent, but in terms of the answer format, maybe the answer is that they are equivalent, but the user might have expected a different answer.

But looking back, the original problem is in the style of a proof, and the user wants the assistant to verify the equivalence. Since the user is probably expecting that the answer is that all three are equivalent, and the final answer is boxed. However, since the problem is about verifying equivalence, and the user might have expected that the answer is simply stating that they are equivalent. However, since the original problem is in the format of (a), (b), (c), and the user is to verify that they are equivalent, but in the absence of specific instructions on what to box, maybe the answer is that they are equivalent, so the final answer is \boxed{a}, \boxed{b}, and \boxed{c} are equivalent. But since the user might have a specific answer, but given that the original problem is in Chinese, maybe the answer is simply confirming that they are equivalent. However, since the user is using English, and the original problem is in English, perhaps the answer is that they are equivalent, so the final answer is that they are equivalent, and in the box, maybe \boxed{a}, \boxed{b}, \boxed{c} are equivalent. However, since the user might have expected a different answer, but given the instructions, I think that the correct way is to state that they are equivalent, so maybe the answer is \boxed{a} divides $ b $, but that is only one condition. Alternatively, since the problem is to verify that all three are equivalent, and the answer is that they are equivalent, but how to box that? Maybe the answer is that all three are equivalent, so the answer is \boxed{\text{All conditions are equivalent}}. However, in standard math problems, sometimes you just state that they are equivalent. But since the user might have a specific answer in mind, perhaps the answer is simply that they are equivalent, and since the original question is about verifying that they are equivalent, the answer is that they are equivalent, so boxed as \boxed{a}, \boxed{b}, and \boxed{c} are equivalent. However, given that the user might have expected that the answer is that they are equivalent, but the exact format is unclear. However, in the original problem, the user might be expecting that the answer is that they are equivalent, and since the user is asking to "verify that the following conditions are equivalent", the answer is that they are equivalent, so in the box, maybe just stating that they are equivalent. However, given the initial problem, perhaps the answer is that they are equivalent, so the final answer is \boxed{a}, \boxed{b}, and \boxed{c} are equivalent. But since the user might have wanted a single boxed answer, maybe the answer is that they are equivalent, so \boxed{a}, \boxed{b}, and \boxed{c} are equivalent. However, in Chinese math problems, sometimes the answer is just stating that they are equivalent, but given the instructions here, I think the correct way is to state that all three are equivalent, so the answer is that they are equivalent, and since the user might expect a box, maybe \boxed{\text{All three conditions are equivalent}}. But since the user might have a different expectation, but given that the problem is to verify the equivalence, the answer is that they are equivalent. However, since the user might have expected that the answer is that they are equivalent, and given that the original problem is in the style of a proof, but the user is asking for the final answer in boxed notation, maybe the answer is simply \boxed{a} divides $ b $, but that is only one condition. Alternatively, since the problem is about verifying that all three are equivalent, maybe the answer is that they are equivalent, and in the box, maybe just \boxed{a}, \boxed{b}, \boxed{c} are equivalent. However, since the user might have expected that the answer is that they are equivalent, and given that in the problem statement, the user is to verify the equivalence, the answer is that they are equivalent, so I think the correct way is to state that they are equivalent, and since the user wants the final answer in boxed, maybe \boxed{a}, \boxed{b}, and \boxed{c} are equivalent. But I think the standard way is to say that they are equivalent, so I will go with that.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{a}, \boxed{b}, and \boxed{c} are equivalent.
</think>

To verify that the three conditions are equivalent for nonzero integers $ a $ and $ b $, we analyze the relationships between the concepts of divisibility, greatest common divisor (gcd), and least common multiple (lcm).

---

### **Condition (a):** $ a \mid b $

This means that $ b $ is a multiple of $ a $, or there exists an integer $ k $ such that $ b = a \cdot k $.

---

### **Condition (b):** $ \gcd(a, b) = |a| $

The gcd of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both. If $ a \mid b $, then $ a $ is a divisor of $ b $, and hence $ a $ divides all common divisors of $ a $ and $ b $. Since $ \gcd(a, b) $ is the greatest such divisor, it must equal $ a $ if $ a > 0 $, or $ -a $ if $ a < 0 $, but since gcd is always positive, we have:

$$
\gcd(a, b) = |a|
$$

Thus, **(a) implies (b)**.

---

### **Condition (c):** $ \text{lcm}(a, b) = |b| $

The lcm of two integers is the smallest positive integer divisible by both. If $ \gcd(a, b) = |a| $, then using the identity:

$$
\gcd(a, b) \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) = |a \cdot b|
$$

we substitute $ \gcd(a, b) = |a| $ to get:

$$
|a| \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) = |a \cdot b| \Rightarrow \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{|a|} = |b|
$$

Thus, **(b) implies (c)**.

---

### **Reverse Implications**

**From (c) to (a):**  
If $ \text{lcm}(a, b) = |b| $, then $ |b| $ is a multiple of both $ a $ and $ b $. In particular, $ |b| $ is a multiple of $ a $, so $ a \mid |b| $. Since $ |b| $ is the absolute value of $ b $, this implies that $ a \mid b $, so **(c) implies (a)**.

---

### **Conclusion**

All three conditions are logically equivalent:

- (a) $ a \mid b $ implies (b) $ \gcd(a, b) = |a| $, which in turn implies (c) $ \text{lcm}(a, b) = |b| $, and finally, (c) implies (a) again.

Thus, the three conditions are **equivalent**.

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{a}, \boxed{b}, \text{ and } \boxed{c} \text{ are equivalent.}
$$
