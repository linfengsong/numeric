Okay, so I need to prove that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive integers divides their least common multiple (lcm). Hmm, let me start by recalling what gcd and lcm mean. The gcd of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. The lcm is the smallest number that both numbers divide into. 

Let me denote the two positive integers as a and b. So, I need to show that gcd(a, b) divides lcm(a, b). Let me think about how these two concepts relate. Maybe I can use the relationship between gcd and lcm? Wait, there's a formula that connects them. I remember something like gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b. Is that right? Let me check with an example. Suppose a = 4 and b = 6. Then gcd(4, 6) is 2, and lcm(4, 6) is 12. Multiplying them gives 2 * 12 = 24, and a * b is 4 * 6 = 24. Yeah, that works. So the formula seems correct. 

So if gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b, then if I can show that gcd(a, b) divides a * b, then since lcm(a, b) is equal to (a * b)/gcd(a, b), then gcd(a, b) must divide lcm(a, b). Wait, but that seems circular. Let me think again. If I have gcd(a, b) multiplied by lcm(a, b) equals a*b, then lcm(a, b) is equal to (a*b)/gcd(a, b). Therefore, if I write that as lcm(a, b) = (a*b)/gcd(a, b), then since gcd(a, b) divides a*b (because gcd(a, b) is a divisor of both a and b, so it divides their product), then (a*b)/gcd(a, b) is an integer. Therefore, lcm(a, b) is an integer, which is obvious. But how does this help me show that gcd(a, b) divides lcm(a, b)?

Wait, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me think about the definitions. Let me denote d = gcd(a, b). So d divides a and d divides b. Let me write a = d * m and b = d * n, where m and n are positive integers. Since d is the greatest common divisor, m and n must be coprime, meaning gcd(m, n) = 1. 

Now, what is the lcm of a and b? The lcm of a and b is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both a and b. Since a = d*m and b = d*n, then the lcm of a and b should be d * lcm(m, n). But since m and n are coprime, their lcm is m*n. Therefore, lcm(a, b) = d * m * n. 

So, if I have lcm(a, b) = d * m * n, then clearly d divides lcm(a, b) because it's a factor of that product. Therefore, d divides lcm(a, b). Therefore, the gcd(a, b) divides the lcm(a, b). 

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check with the example again. Take a = 4 and b = 6. Then d = 2, m = 2, n = 3. Then lcm(a, b) = 2 * 2 * 3 = 12, which is indeed divisible by 2. Another example: a = 3, b = 3. Then d = 3, m = 1, n = 1. LCM is 3*1*1 = 3, which is divisible by 3. Another example: a = 5, b = 7. gcd is 1, lcm is 35. 1 divides 35, which is true. 

But maybe I need to formalize this more. Let me try to write this as a proof. 

Let me start with the definitions. Let d = gcd(a, b). Then, by definition, d divides a and d divides b. Therefore, we can write a = d * m and b = d * n, where m and n are positive integers. Since d is the greatest common divisor, m and n must be coprime, i.e., gcd(m, n) = 1. 

Now, the least common multiple of a and b is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both a and b. Since a = d*m and b = d*n, then any common multiple of a and b must be a multiple of d*m and d*n. The least common multiple would then be d times the least common multiple of m and n. 

But since m and n are coprime, their least common multiple is m*n. Therefore, lcm(a, b) = d * m * n. 

Therefore, since lcm(a, b) is equal to d multiplied by m * n, it follows that d divides lcm(a, b). 

Therefore, the greatest common divisor of a and b divides their least common multiple. 

Is there another way to approach this? Maybe using the property that if a divides b, then the lcm of a and b is b, and the gcd is a. But that might not be helpful here. Alternatively, maybe using prime factorization. Let me try that approach. 

Suppose we write a and b in terms of their prime factors. Let me consider the prime factorization of a and b. For each prime, the exponent in the gcd is the minimum of the exponents in a and b, and the exponent in the lcm is the maximum of the exponents in a and b. 

So, if I take the gcd(a, b) and the lcm(a, b), then for each prime, the exponent in the gcd is less than or equal to the exponent in the lcm. Therefore, the gcd divides the lcm. 

For example, take a prime p. Suppose in a, the exponent of p is e1, and in b, it is e2. Then in gcd(a, b), the exponent is min(e1, e2), and in lcm(a, b), it is max(e1, e2). Since min(e1, e2) â‰¤ max(e1, e2), the exponent of p in gcd(a, b) is less than or equal to that in lcm(a, b). Therefore, gcd(a, b) divides lcm(a, b). 

This seems to be another way to see it. But since the problem is about two positive integers, maybe this is more of a general proof. 

But perhaps the first approach using the formula gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b is more straightforward. Let me think again. If we have that formula, then since gcd(a, b) divides a*b, then lcm(a, b) = (a*b)/gcd(a, b). Therefore, since a*b is divisible by gcd(a, b), then (a*b)/gcd(a, b) is an integer, so lcm(a, b) is an integer. But how does that show that gcd(a, b) divides lcm(a, b)? 

Wait, if lcm(a, b) is equal to (a*b)/gcd(a, b), then since gcd(a, b) divides a*b, then (a*b)/gcd(a, b) is an integer. But that's just saying that lcm(a, b) is an integer, which is obvious. However, if I want to show that gcd(a, b) divides lcm(a, b), then since lcm(a, b) is (a*b)/gcd(a, b), then gcd(a, b) divides (a*b)/gcd(a, b) only if... Wait, no. Wait, if I have lcm(a, b) = (a*b)/gcd(a, b), then gcd(a, b) divides lcm(a, b) if and only if there exists some integer k such that lcm(a, b) = k * gcd(a, b). Which would be true if (a*b)/gcd(a, b) is a multiple of gcd(a, b). Let me check that. 

Let me write (a*b)/gcd(a, b) divided by gcd(a, b) is (a*b)/(gcd(a, b)^2). Is that an integer? Well, since gcd(a, b) divides a and b, then a = gcd(a, b) * m, and b = gcd(a, b) * n, with gcd(m, n) = 1. Then (a*b)/gcd(a, b)^2 = (gcd(a, b)^2 * m * n)/gcd(a, b)^2) = m * n. Which is an integer. Therefore, (a*b)/gcd(a, b) is equal to gcd(a, b) * m * n. Therefore, lcm(a, b) is equal to gcd(a, b) multiplied by m * n. Therefore, gcd(a, b) divides lcm(a, b). 

So this shows that the gcd divides the lcm. Therefore, using the formula, we can see that. 

But maybe the problem is expecting a proof without using the formula? Because sometimes formulas are considered as given. However, the formula itself can be derived from the definitions. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a more direct proof using the definitions of gcd and lcm. 

Let me try to think of another approach. Suppose we have two numbers a and b. Let d = gcd(a, b). Then, since d divides a and d divides b, then d divides any linear combination of a and b. But how does that relate to lcm? 

Alternatively, since d divides a and d divides b, then d divides any common multiple of a and b. Therefore, d divides the least common multiple of a and b. 

Wait, that's a very straightforward argument. Because the least common multiple of a and b is a common multiple of a and b, so since d divides both a and b, then d divides any common multiple of a and b, including the least common multiple. Therefore, d divides lcm(a, b). 

Oh! That seems like a much simpler argument. Why didn't I think of that earlier? 

So, if I can say that since d divides both a and b, then d divides any common multiple of a and b. Therefore, in particular, d divides lcm(a, b). Therefore, the conclusion follows. 

But is that correct? Let me check with an example. Take a = 4, b = 6. Their lcm is 12. The gcd is 2. 2 divides 12, yes. Another example: a = 3, b = 6. gcd is 3, lcm is 6. 3 divides 6. Another example: a = 5, b = 7. gcd is 1, lcm is 35. 1 divides 35. 

So yes, this seems to hold. Therefore, the key idea is that the gcd divides both numbers, so it divides any common multiple, hence it divides the lcm. 

So maybe this is the most straightforward way to prove it. 

But why is that? Let me formalize it. 

Let d = gcd(a, b). Then, since d divides a and d divides b, then d divides any linear combination of a and b. But more directly, since d divides a and d divides b, then d divides any multiple of a and any multiple of b. Therefore, d divides any number that is a multiple of both a and b, which is exactly the definition of a common multiple. Therefore, since the lcm is the least common multiple, it is a common multiple, so d divides it. 

Therefore, the conclusion is immediate. 

But then why do we have the formula gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b? Because that formula is a consequence of the definitions, but maybe the problem is expecting to use that formula? However, if we can use the definition that lcm is a common multiple, then the argument is straightforward. 

But perhaps the problem is expecting to use the formula? Let me check. 

In some textbooks, the proof that gcd divides lcm is done using the formula. But if you can use the definition, then it's simpler. 

But maybe I need to make sure that the lcm is indeed a common multiple. Since the lcm is the least common multiple, it is a multiple of both a and b. Therefore, since d divides both a and b, it divides their lcm. 

Therefore, the proof is as simple as that. 

But maybe the problem is expecting a more detailed proof. Let me try to write it step by step. 

Let a and b be positive integers. Let d = gcd(a, b). Then, by definition, d divides a and d divides b. Therefore, d divides any common multiple of a and b. Since the least common multiple of a and b is a common multiple of a and b, it follows that d divides lcm(a, b). 

Therefore, the greatest common divisor of a and b divides their least common multiple. 

Yes, that seems to be the case. 

Alternatively, if we want to use the formula, then since lcm(a, b) = (a*b)/gcd(a, b), then since a*b is divisible by gcd(a, b), then lcm(a, b) is an integer, but how does that show that gcd(a, b) divides lcm(a, b)? Well, if we have lcm(a, b) = (a*b)/gcd(a, b), then lcm(a, b) divided by gcd(a, b) is (a*b)/gcd(a, b)^2. But since a = gcd(a, b)*m and b = gcd(a, b)*n, then this becomes (gcd(a, b)^2 * m * n)/gcd(a, b)^2) = m * n, which is an integer. Therefore, lcm(a, b) is equal to gcd(a, b) multiplied by m * n, hence gcd(a, b) divides lcm(a, b). 

But this is more involved. However, it's also valid. 

So depending on the approach, there are different ways to prove it. However, the first approach using the definition that lcm is a common multiple is more straightforward. 

Therefore, the answer is that since the gcd divides both numbers, it must divide any common multiple, including the lcm. 

But to make sure, let me check if there's any case where this might not hold. Suppose a and b are 0? But the problem says positive integers, so 0 is excluded. So for positive integers, the gcd is well-defined, and the lcm is also well-defined. 

Another check: if one of the numbers is 1. Let a = 1, b = 1. Then gcd is 1, lcm is 1. 1 divides 1. If a = 1, b = 2. gcd is 1, lcm is 2. 1 divides 2. If a = 1, b = 3, same thing. 

Another case: a = 2, b = 4. gcd is 2, lcm is 4. 2 divides 4. 

So all examples check out. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the gcd divides the lcm. 

But maybe I need to write this in a more formal proof style. Let me try that. 

**Proof:**

Let $ a $ and $ b $ be positive integers. Let $ d = \gcd(a, b) $. By definition, $ d $ divides both $ a $ and $ b $. Therefore, $ d $ divides any linear combination of $ a $ and $ b $. However, more directly, since $ d $ divides $ a $ and $ d $ divides $ b $, it follows that $ d $ divides any common multiple of $ a $ and $ b $. The least common multiple $ \text{lcm}(a, b) $ is a common multiple of $ a $ and $ b $, so $ d $ divides $ \text{lcm}(a, b) $. Therefore, $ \gcd(a, b) $ divides $ \text{lcm}(a, b) $.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{d} divides \text{lcm}(a, b), so the greatest common divisor of two positive integers divides their least common multiple.

Wait, but the problem says to put the final answer within \boxed{}? But the question is to prove that gcd divides lcm, so maybe the answer is just stating that it's true, but in the instructions, the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". However, in math problems, sometimes the answer is a statement, but here since it's a proof, maybe the answer is just confirming that the statement is true, so maybe boxed as \boxed{\text{True}} or something? But the original question says "Prove that the greatest common divisor of two positive integers divides their least common multiple." So maybe the answer is just stating that it's true, but since the user might expect a box around the statement? However, in standard math problems, when asked to prove something, the answer is not boxed, but since the user instruction says to put the final answer within \boxed{}, maybe they expect a statement like \boxed{d \mid \text{lcm}(a, b)} or something. 

Alternatively, since the problem is to prove that gcd divides lcm, and in the problem statement, they might expect the answer to be that it is true, so maybe boxed as \boxed{\text{True}}. But maybe in the context of the original problem, the answer is just confirming the statement, so perhaps the user expects the answer to be the statement that the gcd divides the lcm, which is already given, but since the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", maybe they expect a box around the conclusion. However, in many cases, proofs are not boxed. But given the user's instruction, I think they want the final answer to be boxed. Maybe the answer is that the gcd divides the lcm, so boxed as \boxed{\gcd(a, b) \mid \text{lcm}(a, b)}. But in the problem statement, they might just want to confirm that it's true, so maybe the answer is just \boxed{1} or something? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, since the problem is to prove that gcd divides lcm, and the user wants the final answer in a box, maybe the answer is simply that it is true, so \boxed{\text{True}}. However, in mathematical notation, maybe it's better to write the statement. But since the user hasn't specified, and given that the original problem is a proof, but the user says to put the final answer in a box, I think the answer is just confirming that the statement is true, so maybe \boxed{\text{True}}. However, in the context of the problem, since it's a proof, maybe the answer is just the statement, but in the system's context, perhaps they expect a box around the conclusion. 

Alternatively, since the problem is in the style of a question that might be answered with a yes/no or a statement, but given that the user says "prove that...", and the answer is the statement that gcd divides lcm, but in the absence of specific instructions, maybe the answer is just the statement in a box. However, given that the user might have intended for the answer to be the statement that the gcd divides the lcm, and since in some contexts, the answer is just confirming that, I think the correct way is to write the statement in a box. However, since the problem is in the format of a proof, and the user might have expected the box to contain the conclusion, I think that's acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply that it's true, so boxed as \boxed{\text{True}}.

But to be safe, since the original problem is to prove that gcd divides lcm, and the user wants the final answer boxed, perhaps the answer is just the statement that gcd divides lcm, so I can write:

\boxed{\gcd(a, b) \mid \text{lcm}(a, b)}

But since in the problem statement, they might not have specific variables, but since the problem is general, it's okay. However, in many mathematical contexts, the answer is just stating that it is true, so maybe the box is just for the conclusion. 

Alternatively, since the user might have expected a different answer, but given the instructions, I think that's the way to go.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\gcd(a, b) \mid \text{lcm}(a, b)}
</think>

To prove that the **greatest common divisor (gcd)** of two positive integers divides their **least common multiple (lcm)**, we begin by understanding the definitions and properties of these two quantities.

---

### Definitions and Key Observations

Let $ a $ and $ b $ be two positive integers. Then:

- The **greatest common divisor** $ d = \gcd(a, b) $ is the largest integer that divides both $ a $ and $ b $.
- The **least common multiple** $ \text{lcm}(a, b) $ is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both $ a $ and $ b $.

By definition, the **least common multiple** is a **common multiple** of $ a $ and $ b $, meaning it is divisible by both $ a $ and $ b $. Therefore, it is also divisible by any common divisor of $ a $ and $ b $, including the **greatest common divisor** $ \gcd(a, b) $.

---

### Formal Proof

Let $ d = \gcd(a, b) $. Then:

- Since $ d $ divides both $ a $ and $ b $, it must divide any linear combination of $ a $ and $ b $.
- In particular, $ d $ divides any **common multiple** of $ a $ and $ b $, including the **least common multiple** $ \text{lcm}(a, b) $.

Thus, it follows that:

$$
\gcd(a, b) \mid \text{lcm}(a, b)
$$

---

### Conclusion

This result is a direct consequence of the definition of the least common multiple and the properties of the greatest common divisor. Since the gcd divides both numbers, it must divide any common multiple, including the lcm.

$$
\boxed{\gcd(a, b) \mid \text{lcm}(a, b)}
$$
