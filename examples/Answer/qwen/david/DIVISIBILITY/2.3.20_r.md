Okay, so I need to confirm these properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd). Let me take them one by one. Starting with part (a). 

(a) If gcd(a, b) = 1 and gcd(a, c) = 1, then gcd(a, bc) = 1. The hint says to use the fact that 1 = ax + by = au + cv, and then multiply those two equations. Let me try to follow that.

First, since gcd(a, b) = 1, there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = 1. Similarly, since gcd(a, c) = 1, there are integers u and v such that au + cv = 1. If I multiply these two equations together, I get:

(ax + by)(au + cv) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Expanding the left side: ax*au + ax*cv + by*au + by*cv. Which simplifies to a²xu + acxv + abyu + bc yv. 

But the hint says that this equals a(aux + cvx + byu) + bc(yv). Wait, maybe I need to group terms differently. Let me see. The first term is a²xu, which is a*(aux). The second term is acxv, the third term is abyu, and the fourth term is bc yv. So combining the first, second, and third terms, we can factor out a: a*(aux + cvx + byu) + bc(yv). 

So the entire expression is a*(something) + bc*(something else). Therefore, since the whole thing equals 1, which is 1 = a*(something) + bc*(something else). 

But since gcd(a, bc) is supposed to be 1, maybe this shows that a and bc are coprime? Because if there was a common divisor d of a and bc, then d divides the left side, which is 1. Hence, d must be 1. Therefore, gcd(a, bc) = 1. 

Wait, but how does that follow? Let me think again. Suppose that d is a common divisor of a and bc. Then d divides a and d divides bc. But from the equation above, 1 = a*(something) + bc*(something else). Therefore, d divides 1. Hence, d must be 1. Therefore, gcd(a, bc) = 1. 

Yes, that seems to work. So part (a) is proven using the hint. 

Moving on to part (b): If gcd(a, b) = 1 and c divides a, then gcd(b, c) = 1. 

So if c divides a, then there exists some integer k such that a = c*k. Then, since gcd(a, b) = 1, which is the same as gcd(c*k, b) = 1. Now, if a prime divides both c and b, then it divides a and b, which contradicts gcd(a, b) = 1. Therefore, any common divisor of c and b must divide a and b, which is impossible. Therefore, gcd(b, c) = 1. 

Alternatively, suppose that d divides both b and c. Then d divides c, which divides a, so d divides a. But since gcd(a, b) = 1, d must divide 1. Therefore, d = 1. Hence, gcd(b, c) = 1. 

That seems straightforward. 

Part (c): If gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(ac, b) = gcd(c, b). 

Hmm. So we need to show that the gcd of ac and b is the same as the gcd of c and b. 

Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then a and b share no common factors. Therefore, any common divisor of ac and b must divide c and b. Because if a prime divides ac and b, then it divides ac and b. Since a and b are coprime, the prime can't divide a and b, so it must divide c and b. Therefore, gcd(ac, b) = gcd(c, b). 

Alternatively, maybe using the property that gcd(ac, b) = gcd(a, b) * gcd(c, b)/gcd(a, b)? Wait, no, that formula isn't correct. Wait, actually, there's a formula for gcd(ac, b) when gcd(a, b) = 1. Let me think. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b) = 1, then a and b are coprime. Therefore, any common divisor of ac and b must divide c and b. Because if a prime divides ac and b, then it divides ac and b. Since it divides b and a is coprime with b, it can't divide a, so it must divide c. Therefore, the gcd(ac, b) is the same as gcd(c, b). 

Yes, that makes sense. So part (c) is proven. 

Part (d): If gcd(a, b) = 1 and c divides a + b, then gcd(a, c) = gcd(b, c) = 1. 

The hint says to let d = gcd(a, c). Then d divides a and c, so d divides a + b - a = b. Therefore, d divides b. But since gcd(a, b) = 1, then d divides 1. Therefore, d = 1. Hence, gcd(a, c) = 1. Similarly, if we let d = gcd(b, c), then d divides b and c, so d divides a + b - b = a. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, d divides 1. Hence, d = 1. 

Therefore, both gcd(a, c) and gcd(b, c) are 1. 

So that's part (d). 

Part (e): If gcd(a, b) = 1, d divides ac, and d divides be, then d divides c. 

So we have that d divides ac and d divides be. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, we need to show that d divides c. 

Let me think. Since d divides ac and d divides be, then d divides any linear combination. But since gcd(a, b) = 1, maybe we can use the fact that d must divide c. 

Alternatively, suppose that d divides ac and d divides be. Let me consider that since gcd(a, b) = 1, then a and b are coprime. Therefore, any common divisor of ac and be must divide c and e? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b) = 1, then a and b are coprime. So if d divides ac and d divides be, then d divides c. 

Wait, here's a way: Let me suppose that d divides ac and d divides be. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a, be) = gcd(a, b)*gcd(a, e) = 1 * gcd(a, e). Wait, maybe not. Wait, actually, gcd(a, be) is gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, e) if a and b are coprime? Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, since d divides ac and d divides be, then d divides ac and d divides be. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then any common divisor of ac and be must divide c and e? Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, let me think about prime factors. Suppose that a prime p divides d. Then p divides ac and be. Since p divides ac, then p divides a or p divides c. Similarly, since p divides be, p divides b or p divides e. But since gcd(a, b) = 1, p cannot divide both a and b. Therefore, if p divides a, then it cannot divide b, so since p divides be, it must divide e. But how does that help? 

Wait, but we need to show that p divides c. If p divides ac and be, and since gcd(a, b) = 1, then if p divides a, then p divides be. But since p divides a and gcd(a, b) = 1, p cannot divide b, so p divides e. But that doesn't directly say anything about c. Wait, but if p divides ac, then p divides a or c. If p divides a, then p divides be, but since p divides a and gcd(a, b)=1, p doesn't divide b, so p divides e. But how does that help? 

Alternatively, if p divides ac and be, then p divides ac and be. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then p divides c or p divides e? Not sure. Wait, but if p divides ac and be, and since gcd(a, b) = 1, then p divides c and p divides e? 

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose p divides d. Then p divides ac and be. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then p cannot divide both a and b. So if p divides a, then since p divides be, and p doesn't divide b, then p divides e. Similarly, if p divides b, then since p divides ac and p doesn't divide a, then p divides c. But how does that help? 

Wait, but the problem says that d divides ac and be. So if p divides d, then p divides ac and be. If p divides a, then p divides e. If p divides b, then p divides c. But how do we know that p divides c? 

Wait, maybe there's a better way. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = 1. Then, if d divides ac and be, then d divides ac and be. Let me see. 

Alternatively, since d divides ac and d divides be, then d divides any linear combination. For example, if I can find some combination that gives me c. 

Wait, here's a thought. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = 1. Let me multiply both sides by e: axe + bye = e. Then, since d divides ac and be, then d divides axe + bye. But d divides ac, so d divides ac. Also, d divides be. Therefore, d divides axe + bye. But axe is a multiple of ac? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since d divides ac, then d divides ac. Also, d divides be. Let me consider that if d divides ac and be, then d divides any linear combination. For example, if I can write c as a combination. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b) = 1, then a and b are coprime. Therefore, if d divides ac and be, then d divides c and e? Not sure. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention e. Wait, the problem says d divides ac and d divides be. So, if d divides ac and be, then since gcd(a, b) = 1, then d divides c. 

Wait, here's a way: Let me suppose that d divides ac and d divides be. Then, since gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a, be) = gcd(a, b) * gcd(a, e) = 1 * gcd(a, e). Similarly, gcd(b, ac) = gcd(b, a) * gcd(b, c) = 1 * gcd(b, c). But I don't know if that helps. 

Alternatively, since d divides ac and be, then d divides ac and d divides be. Let me consider that if d divides ac and d divides be, then d divides any common divisor of ac and be. But since gcd(a, b) = 1, then the gcd of ac and be is gcd(ac, be) = gcd(a, be) * gcd(c, be)/something? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b) = 1, then a and b are coprime. Therefore, if a prime divides d, then it divides ac and be. So, if p divides d, then p divides ac and be. Since p divides ac, p divides a or p divides c. If p divides a, then since p divides be and gcd(a, b) = 1, p doesn't divide b, so p divides e. But how does that relate to c? 

Wait, but if p divides d, then p divides ac and be. If p divides a, then p divides e. But if p divides be, and p divides a, then p divides e. However, the problem states that d divides ac and be. But how do we know that p divides c? 

Wait, maybe I need to use the fact that d divides ac and be. Let me suppose that d divides ac and be. Then, since gcd(a, b) = 1, then d divides c. 

Wait, here's another approach. Let me think of d as a common divisor of ac and be. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then any common divisor of ac and be must divide c and e? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b) = 1, then a and b are coprime. Therefore, if d divides ac and be, then d divides c. Because if d divides ac and be, then since a and b are coprime, d divides c. Wait, how?

Let me think of it in terms of prime factors. Suppose that p is a prime dividing d. Then p divides ac and be. Since p divides ac, p divides a or p divides c. Similarly, since p divides be, p divides b or p divides e. But since gcd(a, b) = 1, p cannot divide both a and b. So if p divides a, then p cannot divide b, so p divides e. But how does that help? 

Alternatively, if p divides a, then p divides e. If p divides b, then p divides c. But how do we know that p divides c? 

Wait, but if p divides d, then p divides ac and be. If p divides a, then p divides e. But since d divides ac and be, then p divides ac and be. However, we don't have any information about e. 

Wait, maybe there's a different way. Let me think of the problem again. If d divides ac and d divides be, then since gcd(a, b) = 1, then d divides c. 

Wait, here's a way. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = 1. Multiply both sides by c: axc + byc = c. Now, since d divides ac and d divides be, then d divides axc (because d divides ac, so multiplying by x gives d divides axc). Also, d divides byc (because d divides be, so multiplying by c gives d divides byc). Therefore, d divides axc + byc = c. Therefore, d divides c. 

Yes! That works. So that's the way. So by using the fact that gcd(a, b) = 1, we can find integers x and y such that ax + by = 1, then multiplying by c gives axc + byc = c, and since d divides ac and be, it divides both terms on the left, so it divides c. Therefore, d divides c. Hence, part (e) is proven. 

Part (f): If gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a², b²) = 1. 

The hint says to first show that gcd(a, b²) = gcd(a², b) = 1. 

So first, let's show that gcd(a, b²) = 1. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then any prime divisor of a cannot divide b. Therefore, it cannot divide b² either. Therefore, gcd(a, b²) = 1. Similarly, gcd(a², b) = 1. 

Then, since gcd(a², b²) = gcd(a², b²). But since gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a², b²) = 1. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b) = 1, then a and b are coprime. Therefore, their squares are also coprime. Because if a prime divides a² and b², then it divides a and b, which contradicts gcd(a, b) = 1. Hence, gcd(a², b²) = 1. 

Alternatively, using the hint, since gcd(a, b²) = 1 and gcd(a², b) = 1, then gcd(a², b²) = 1. 

But how does that follow? Well, if gcd(a², b²) = gcd(a², b²). Since gcd(a, b²) = 1, then any common divisor of a² and b² must divide b² and a². But since gcd(a, b²) = 1, then any common divisor of a² and b² must divide 1. Hence, gcd(a², b²) = 1. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a², b²) = 1. 

Therefore, part (f) is proven. 

Let me check again if I made any mistakes. 

For part (a), the multiplication of the two equations gives 1 = a*(...) + bc*(...), which implies that any common divisor of a and bc must divide 1, hence gcd(a, bc)=1. That seems correct. 

For part (b), since c divides a, and gcd(a, b)=1, then any common divisor of c and b must divide a and b, hence 1. Correct. 

Part (c): Since a and b are coprime, any common divisor of ac and b must divide c and b. Hence, gcd(ac, b) = gcd(c, b). Correct. 

Part (d): Using the fact that if d divides a and c, then d divides b, hence d=1. Correct. 

Part (e): Using the linear combination, since gcd(a, b)=1, we can find x and y such that ax + by = 1, then multiplying by c gives axc + byc = c, and since d divides ac and be, it divides c. Correct. 

Part (f): Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then their squares are also coprime. Correct. 

I think all parts are correct. Therefore, the answers are all confirmed.

**Final Answer**

(a) $\boxed{1}$

(b) $\boxed{1}$

(c) $\boxed{\gcd(c, b)}$

(d) $\boxed{1}$

(e) $\boxed{1}$

(f) $\boxed{1}$

### Confirmation of Properties of the Greatest Common Divisor

We will confirm the following properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd), step by step, using logical reasoning and the given hints.

---

### **(a)** If $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ and $\gcd(a, c) = 1$, then $\gcd(a, bc) = 1$.

Since $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, there exist integers $x, y$ such that:
$$
ax + by = 1
$$
Similarly, since $\gcd(a, c) = 1$, there exist integers $u, v$ such that:
$$
au + cv = 1
$$
Multiplying these two equations:
$$
(ax + by)(au + cv) = 1
$$
Expanding:
$$
a^2xu + acxv + abyu + bc yv = 1
$$
This can be rewritten as:
$$
a(\text{some integer}) + bc(\text{some integer}) = 1
$$
This implies that any common divisor of $a$ and $bc$ must divide 1, hence the gcd is 1.

**Answer:** $\boxed{1}$

---

### **(b)** If $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ and $c \mid a$, then $\gcd(b, c) = 1$.

If $c \mid a$, then $a = c \cdot k$ for some integer $k$. Suppose $d = \gcd(b, c)$. Then $d \mid b$ and $d \mid c$, so $d \mid a$. But $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, so $d = 1$.

**Answer:** $\boxed{1}$

---

### **(c)** If $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then $\gcd(ac, b) = \gcd(c, b)$.

Since $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, any common divisor of $ac$ and $b$ must divide $c$ and $b$. This is because if a prime divides $ac$ and $b$, it cannot divide $a$ (since $\gcd(a, b) = 1$), so it must divide $c$ and $b$.

Thus:
$$
\gcd(ac, b) = \gcd(c, b)
$$

**Answer:** $\boxed{\gcd(c, b)}$

---

### **(d)** If $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ and $c \mid a + b$, then $\gcd(a, c) = \gcd(b, c) = 1$.

Let $d = \gcd(a, c)$. Since $d \mid a$ and $d \mid c$, then $d \mid (a + b) - a = b$. Thus $d \mid b$. But $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, so $d = 1$. Similarly, $\gcd(b, c) = 1$.

**Answer:** $\boxed{1}$

---

### **(e)** If $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, $d \mid ac$, and $d \mid be$, then $d \mid c$.

Let $d \mid ac$ and $d \mid be$. Since $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, there exist integers $x, y$ such that $ax + by = 1$. Multiplying by $c$:
$$
axc + byc = c
$$
Since $d \mid ac$ and $d \mid be$, it follows that $d \mid axc$ and $d \mid byc$, hence $d \mid c$.

**Answer:** $\boxed{1}$

---

### **(f)** If $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then $\gcd(a^2, b^2) = 1$.

If $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then no prime divides both $a$ and $b$, so no prime divides both $a^2$ and $b^2$. Therefore, $\gcd(a^2, b^2) = 1$.

**Answer:** $\boxed{1}$

---

### Final Answers

(a) $\boxed{1}$  
(b) $\boxed{1}$  
(c) $\boxed{\gcd(c, b)}$  
(d) $\boxed{1}$  
(e) $\boxed{1}$  
(f) $\boxed{1}$
