Okay, so I need to verify these two relations between pentagonal, square, and triangular numbers for n ≥ 2. Let me start by recalling the formulas for these numbers. 

First, the pentagonal numbers. I think the formula for the nth pentagonal number is p_n = (3n² - n)/2. Let me check that... Hmm, I remember that pentagonal numbers have a formula similar to triangular numbers but with a different coefficient. Yeah, I think that's right. Let me confirm with a small n. For n=1, p_1 should be 1. Plugging in: (3(1)^2 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. Okay, that works. For n=2: (3*4 - 2)/2 = (12 - 2)/2 = 10/2 = 5. Let me check if that's correct. The pentagonal numbers go 1, 2, 5, 12, 22... Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the sequence. Wait, actually, the pentagonal numbers are 1, 2, 5, 12, 22... Wait, but according to the formula, p_1=1, p_2=(3*4 -2)/2= (12-2)/2=5, which is correct. Then p_3=(3*9 -3)/2=(27-3)/2=24/2=12. Yes, that seems right. So formula is correct.

Triangular numbers: t_n = n(n+1)/2. That's standard. For example, t_1=1, t_2=3, t_3=6, etc.

Square numbers: s_n = n². Simple enough.

So, part (a): p_n = t_{n-1} + n². Let me check that.

First, compute t_{n-1} + n². t_{n-1} is (n-1)n / 2. So adding n² gives (n² - n)/2 + n² = (n² - n + 2n²)/2 = (3n² - n)/2. Which is exactly the formula for p_n. So that checks out. Therefore, part (a) is verified. That was straightforward.

Now part (b): p_n = 3t_{n-1} + n = 2t_{n-1} + t_n. Wait, so two separate expressions? Let me check each one.

First, 3t_{n-1} + n. Let me compute that. t_{n-1} is (n-1)n / 2. Multiply by 3: 3*(n² -n)/2. Then add n: 3(n² -n)/2 + n = (3n² - 3n)/2 + 2n/2 = (3n² -3n + 2n)/2 = (3n² -n)/2. Which is p_n. So that works. 

Now the second part: 2t_{n-1} + t_n. Let me compute that. 2t_{n-1} is 2*(n-1)n / 2 = (n-1)n. Then t_n is n(n+1)/2. So adding them together: (n-1)n + n(n+1)/2. Let me compute that. Let's write both terms with denominator 2:

First term: 2(n-1)n / 2 = [2n² - 2n]/2.

Second term: n(n+1)/2 = [n² + n]/2.

Adding them together: [2n² -2n + n² +n]/2 = (3n² -n)/2. Which is again p_n. So that also works. Therefore, both expressions in part (b) are correct.

Wait, but the problem says "verify the following relations", so maybe I need to write more formal steps? Let me check again.

But maybe I need to make sure that I'm using the correct indices. For example, in part (a), t_{n-1} is the (n-1)th triangular number. So for example, if n=2, then t_{1} + 2² = 1 + 4 = 5, which is p_2. Which is correct. Similarly, for n=3: t_2 + 9 = 3 + 9 = 12, which is p_3. Correct. 

For part (b), first expression: 3t_{n-1} + n. For n=2: 3t_1 + 2 = 3*1 + 2 = 5, which is p_2. For n=3: 3t_2 + 3 = 3*3 + 3 = 12, which is p_3. Correct.

Second expression: 2t_{n-1} + t_n. For n=2: 2t_1 + t_2 = 2*1 + 3 = 5. Correct. For n=3: 2t_2 + t_3 = 2*3 + 6 = 12. Correct. So all examples check out.

Therefore, both relations (a) and (b) are verified. 

But let me think again if there is any possible mistake. For example, in part (b), the second expression is 2t_{n-1} + t_n. Let me write that in terms of formulas:

2t_{n-1} + t_n = 2*( (n-1)n / 2 ) + (n(n+1)/2 ) = (n-1)n + n(n+1)/2. Wait, but when I calculated that earlier, I converted to common denominator and got (3n² -n)/2. Let me check that again:

(n-1)n is n² -n. Then adding n(n+1)/2: so total is n² -n + [n² +n]/2. Let me compute:

Convert n² -n to 2n² - 2n over 2. Then adding n² +n over 2 gives (2n² -2n + n² +n)/2 = (3n² -n)/2. Correct. So that's p_n. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to see this? For example, maybe using known relationships between these numbers. But since the algebra checks out and the examples work, I think it's verified.

So conclusion: both (a) and (b) are correct. Therefore, the relations are verified.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{p_n = t_{n-1} + n^2}  
(b) \boxed{p_n = 3t_{n-1} + n} and \boxed{p_n = 2t_{n-1} + t_n}

To verify the given relations between pentagonal, square, and triangular numbers for $ n \geq 2 $, we begin by recalling their standard formulas:

- **Pentagonal numbers**:  
  $$
  p_n = \frac{3n^2 - n}{2}
  $$

- **Triangular numbers**:  
  $$
  t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
  $$

- **Square numbers**:  
  $$
  s_n = n^2
  $$

### **(a) $ p_n = t_{n-1} + n^2 $**

We compute the right-hand side:

$$
t_{n-1} + n^2 = \frac{(n-1)n}{2} + n^2
$$

Simplify:

$$
= \frac{n^2 - n}{2} + n^2 = \frac{n^2 - n + 2n^2}{2} = \frac{3n^2 - n}{2}
$$

This matches the formula for $ p_n $, so the identity is verified.

$$
\boxed{p_n = t_{n-1} + n^2}
$$

### **(b) $ p_n = 3t_{n-1} + n $ and $ p_n = 2t_{n-1} + t_n $**

#### First expression: $ p_n = 3t_{n-1} + n $

Compute the right-hand side:

$$
3t_{n-1} + n = 3 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n}{2} + n = \frac{3n(n-1)}{2} + n
$$

Simplify:

$$
= \frac{3n^2 - 3n}{2} + \frac{2n}{2} = \frac{3n^2 - n}{2}
$$

This matches $ p_n $, so the identity holds.

#### Second expression: $ p_n = 2t_{n-1} + t_n $

Compute the right-hand side:

$$
2t_{n-1} + t_n = 2 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n}{2} + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

Simplify:

$$
= (n-1)n + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = n^2 - n + \frac{n^2 + n}{2}
$$

Convert to common denominator:

$$
= \frac{2n^2 - 2n + n^2 + n}{2} = \frac{3n^2 - n}{2}
$$

This again matches $ p_n $, so the identity is verified.
