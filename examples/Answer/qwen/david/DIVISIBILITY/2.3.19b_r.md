Okay, so I need to prove that if a is an odd integer, then 24 divides a(a² - 1). The hint says that the square of an odd integer is of the form 8k + 1. Let me start by recalling what it means for 24 to divide a number. 24 factors into 8 and 3, right? So if I can show that 8 divides a(a² - 1) and 3 divides a(a² - 1), then since 8 and 3 are coprime, their product 24 will divide the number. That seems like a good approach.

First, let me tackle the divisibility by 8. The hint says that an odd integer squared is 8k + 1. Let me verify that. If a is odd, then a can be written as 2m + 1 for some integer m. Then a² is (2m + 1)² = 4m² + 4m + 1 = 4m(m + 1) + 1. Now, m(m + 1) is the product of two consecutive integers, so one of them must be even. Therefore, m(m + 1) is even, so 4 times an even number is 8 times some integer. Hence, a² = 8k + 1 for some integer k. Therefore, a² - 1 = 8k. Therefore, a(a² - 1) = a * 8k. Since a is an integer, this product is clearly divisible by 8. So that takes care of the 8 part.

Now, I need to show that 3 divides a(a² - 1). Let me think about this. Since 3 is a prime number, I can use modular arithmetic here. Let me consider the possible residues of a modulo 3. Since a is an integer, it can be congruent to 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3.

Case 1: If a ≡ 0 mod 3, then a is divisible by 3, so a(a² - 1) is divisible by 3.

Case 2: If a ≡ 1 mod 3, then a² ≡ 1² ≡ 1 mod 3, so a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, a(a² - 1) is divisible by 3.

Case 3: If a ≡ 2 mod 3, then a² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3, so again a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, a(a² - 1) is divisible by 3.

So in all cases, 3 divides a(a² - 1). Therefore, combining both results, since 8 and 3 divide a(a² - 1), then 24 divides a(a² - 1). Therefore, the assertion is proven.

Wait, but let me check if there's a more straightforward way or if I missed something. Let me test with some examples. Let's take a = 1. Then a(a² - 1) = 1*(1 - 1) = 0, which is divisible by 24. Okay. Take a = 3. Then 3*(9 - 1) = 3*8 = 24, which is divisible by 24. Good. a = 5: 5*(25 - 1) = 5*24 = 120, which is divisible by 24. a = 7: 7*(49 - 1) = 7*48 = 336. 336 divided by 24 is 14. Yep. So examples check out.

But let me think again about the divisibility by 3. Maybe there's another way to see it. Since a is odd, but that doesn't directly affect the modulo 3. However, maybe there's a way to combine the two factors. Alternatively, since a is odd, a is either 1 or 2 mod 3, but regardless, as shown above, a² - 1 is 0 mod 3. Wait, but if a is 0 mod 3, then a is divisible by 3. So in any case, either a is divisible by 3 or a² - 1 is. Therefore, 3 divides the product.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor a³ - a. Wait, a³ - a = a(a² - 1). So the problem is to show that 24 divides a³ - a. I remember that for any integer a, a³ - a is divisible by 6, because it's a³ - a = a(a² - 1), which is divisible by 2 and 3. But here we need divisibility by 24, which is 8*3. So maybe there's a way to show that a³ - a is divisible by 8 and 3. But since we already did that, maybe that's redundant.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that for odd a, a is congruent to 1 or 3 mod 4, but not sure. Wait, but earlier we showed that a² - 1 is divisible by 8. So a(a² - 1) is divisible by 8, and also by 3. Therefore, 24 divides it. So that's the argument.

But let me check if there's a possible mistake here. For example, suppose a is 1 mod 8. Then a² - 1 is 0 mod 8. If a is 3 mod 8, then a² is 9 mod 8, which is 1 mod 8, so again a² - 1 is 0 mod 8. Similarly for 5 mod 8, 5² is 25 mod 8 is 1, so again same. 7 mod 8, 7² is 49 mod 8 is 1. So yes, regardless of a being odd, a² - 1 is divisible by 8. Therefore, a(a² - 1) is divisible by 8. And as shown earlier, divisible by 3. Therefore, 24 divides it.

Therefore, the assertion is proven. So I think that's the answer. Let me just write it in a formal way.

**Final Answer**

To establish the assertion that if $ a $ is an odd integer, then $ 24 \mid a(a^2 - 1) $, we proceed by analyzing the divisibility of the expression $ a(a^2 - 1) $ by both 8 and 3, since $ 24 = 8 \times 3 $, and 8 and 3 are coprime.

### Step 1: Show that $ 8 \mid a(a^2 - 1) $

Let $ a $ be an odd integer. Then, we can express $ a $ as $ a = 2m + 1 $, where $ m $ is an integer. Then:

$$
a^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 4m(m + 1) + 1
$$

Now, $ m(m + 1) $ is the product of two consecutive integers, so it must be even. Therefore, $ 4m(m + 1) $ is divisible by 8. Thus:

$$
a^2 = 8k + 1 \quad \text{for some integer } k
$$

Subtracting 1:

$$
a^2 - 1 = 8k
$$

Therefore, $ a(a^2 - 1) = a \cdot 8k $, which is clearly divisible by 8.

### Step 2: Show that $ 3 \mid a(a^2 - 1) $

We analyze the expression modulo 3. Consider the possible values of $ a \mod 3 $:

- If $ a \equiv 0 \mod 3 $, then $ a $ is divisible by 3, so $ a(a^2 - 1) $ is divisible by 3.
- If $ a \equiv 1 \mod 3 $, then $ a^2 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $, so $ a^2 - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $, and thus $ a(a^2 - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 3 $.
- If $ a \equiv 2 \mod 3 $, then $ a^2 \equiv 4 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $, so again $ a^2 - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $, and $ a(a^2 - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 3 $.

In all cases, $ 3 \mid a(a^2 - 1) $.

---

### Step 3: Conclude that $ 24 \mid a(a^2 - 1) $

Since $ a(a^2 - 1) $ is divisible by both 8 and 3, and since $ \gcd(8, 3) = 1 $, it follows that:

$$
24 \mid a(a^2 - 1)
$$
