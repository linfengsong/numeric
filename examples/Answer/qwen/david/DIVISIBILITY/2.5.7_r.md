<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, Mr. Smith cashed a check, but the teller swapped the dollars and cents. So, if the check was, say, $X dollars and Y cents, the bank gave him Y dollars and X cents instead. Then, after he spent 68 cents, he realized he had twice the original check. We need to find the smallest amount for the original check.

First, let me define variables. Let me let the original check be D dollars and C cents. So, the original amount in cents would be 100D + C. But the teller gave him C dollars and D cents instead. So, in cents, that would be 100C + D. Then, Mr. Smith spent 68 cents, so he had 100C + D - 68 cents left. According to the problem, this amount is twice the original check. So:

100C + D - 68 = 2*(100D + C)

Let me write that equation down:

100C + D - 68 = 200D + 2C

Let me rearrange terms to collect like terms. Let me subtract 2C and subtract D from both sides:

100C - 2C + D - D - 68 = 200D - D + 2C - 2C?

Wait, maybe better to bring all terms to left side:

100C + D - 68 - 200D - 2C = 0

Simplify:

(100C - 2C) + (D - 200D) - 68 = 0

Which is:

98C - 199D - 68 = 0

So:

98C - 199D = 68

Hmm. So, 98C = 199D + 68

So, we need integers D and C such that this equation holds. Also, D and C must be non-negative integers, with C < 100 (since it's cents) and D is a non-negative integer (dollars). Also, since the original check is D dollars and C cents, D must be at least 0, and C must be between 0 and 99 inclusive.

So, the problem is to find the smallest original check, which would be the smallest value of 100D + C, given that 98C - 199D = 68.

Alternatively, maybe I can write this equation as:

98C = 199D + 68

So, 98C = 199D + 68.

We need to find integers D and C such that this holds, with C < 100.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange:

Let me think. Since 98 and 199 are coefficients, maybe I can think of this as a linear Diophantine equation.

But first, let me check if there are solutions. The equation is 98C - 199D = 68.

So, in standard form, that's 98C - 199D = 68.

We can think of this as 98C - 199D = 68.

We need integer solutions for C and D.

First, let me check if gcd(98, 199) divides 68. Since 199 is a prime number? Let me check. 199 divided by 2, no. 3? 1+9+9=19, not divisible by 3. 5? No. 7? 7*28 is 196, 199-196=3, not divisible by 7. 11? 11*18=198, 199-198=1. So yes, 199 is prime. And 98 is 2*49=2*7^2. So, gcd(98,199). Since 199 is prime and doesn't divide 98, so gcd is 1. Therefore, since 1 divides 68, there are solutions.

So, we can find solutions. Now, we need to find the minimal value of 100D + C.

But how?

Let me think. Let me try to solve the equation 98C - 199D = 68.

Let me rearrange it as:

98C = 199D + 68.

So, 98C = 199D + 68.

So, 98C ≡ 68 mod 199.

Alternatively, maybe solve for C:

C = (199D + 68)/98.

But since C must be integer, 199D + 68 must be divisible by 98.

So, 199D + 68 ≡ 0 mod 98.

Let me compute 199 mod 98. 98*2=196, so 199-196=3. Therefore, 199 ≡ 3 mod 98.

Similarly, 68 mod 98 is 68.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

3D + 68 ≡ 0 mod 98.

So:

3D ≡ -68 mod 98.

But -68 mod 98 is 98 - 68 = 30. Therefore:

3D ≡ 30 mod 98.

Divide both sides by gcd(3,98). Since gcd(3,98)=1, we can divide:

D ≡ 30/3 mod 98/1 => D ≡ 10 mod 98.

Therefore, D = 10 + 98k, where k is integer.

So, D is of the form 10 + 98k.

Since D must be non-negative, and C must be less than 100, let's find possible values of k.

First, let's take k=0: D=10. Then, let's compute C:

From 98C = 199D + 68. So, 98C = 199*10 + 68 = 1990 + 68 = 2058.

Therefore, C = 2058 / 98. Let me compute that. 98*21 = 2058. So, C=21. Which is less than 100. So, that works. Therefore, D=10, C=21. Therefore, original check is 10 dollars and 21 cents, which is $10.21.

But wait, but the problem says "the smallest value for which the check could have been written". Is $10.21 the smallest? Let me check if there's a smaller D. Since D=10 + 98k. For k=-1, D=10 - 98= -88, which is negative, invalid. So k=0 is the first possible. So, D=10, C=21. So, original check is $10.21. But let me check if that works.

Original check: $10.21. The bank gave him $21.10 instead. Then he spent 68 cents. So, he had 21.10 - 0.68 = 20.42. Is that twice the original check? Original check was 10.21, twice that is 20.42. Yes! So that works.

But wait, the problem says "the smallest value for which the check could have been written." Is there a smaller check? Let me think. Maybe there's another solution with smaller D? But according to our equation, D must be 10 + 98k. So, if k=0, D=10. If k=-1, negative. So, the next possible is k=0. Therefore, 10.21 is the minimal? But let me check if there's another solution where D is smaller. Wait, but according to our modular equation, D must be congruent to 10 mod 98, so the minimal D is 10. So, unless there's another solution with D less than 10, but according to our equation, there isn't. So, maybe 10.21 is the answer?

But wait, let me check with k=0, D=10, C=21. But maybe there's another solution where D is smaller? Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in solving the congruence?

So, starting again:

We had 3D ≡ 30 mod 98. Therefore, D ≡ 10 mod 98. So D=10 + 98k. So, the minimal D is 10, then 10+98=108, etc. So, 10 is the minimal D. Therefore, the original check is 10 dollars and 21 cents. So, $10.21.

But let me check if there is a smaller check. Suppose, for example, that the original check was less than $10.21. Let's say, for example, D=0. Then, let's check if there is a C such that 98C - 199*0 = 68 => 98C=68 => C=68/98= 34/49, which is not integer. So no.

D=1: 98C - 199*1 = 68 => 98C=68 +199=267 => C=267/98≈2.724... Not integer.

D=2: 98C = 68 + 398= 466. 466/98≈4.755... Not integer.

D=3: 68 + 597= 665. 665/98≈6.785... Not integer.

D=4: 68 + 796= 864. 864/98≈8.816... Not integer.

D=5: 68 + 995= 1063. 1063/98≈10.846... Not integer.

D=6: 68 + 1194= 1262. 1262/98≈12.877... Not integer.

D=7: 68 + 1393= 1461. 1461/98≈14.908... Not integer.

D=8: 68 + 1592= 1660. 1660/98≈16.938... Not integer.

D=9: 68 + 1791= 1859. 1859/98≈18.969... Not integer.

D=10: 68 + 1990= 2058. 2058/98=21. So that works. So, yes, D=10 is the first one. Therefore, the original check is $10.21.

But wait, the problem says "the smallest value for which the check could have been written." But maybe there's another solution with D=10, but smaller cents? But C=21 is the value here. But maybe there's another solution where D is higher but C is lower? For example, with k=1, D=10+98=108. Then C would be?

From 98C = 199*108 + 68. Let me compute that. 199*108: 200*108 - 1*108 = 21600 - 108 = 21492. Then add 68: 21492 + 68 = 21560. Then C=21560 / 98. Let me compute that. 98*220= 21560. So C=220. But C must be less than 100. So that's invalid. Therefore, that solution is invalid. Therefore, k=1 gives C=220 which is too big.

Similarly, for k=-1, D= -88, invalid.

Therefore, only k=0 gives a valid solution. Therefore, the original check is $10.21. So, is that the answer? But let me check again with the problem statement.

Original check: $10.21. The bank gave him $21.10. Then he spent 68 cents, so 21.10 - 0.68 = 20.42. Which is twice the original check: 2*10.21 = 20.42. Correct. So that works.

But the question says "the smallest value for which the check could have been written." Is there a smaller check? Let me think again. Maybe there is another solution where D and C are smaller? But according to our equations, D must be 10 + 98k, so the next possible is D=10. So, unless there's another solution with different congruence?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the congruence?

Let me check again.

Original equation: 98C - 199D = 68.

We rearranged to 3D ≡ 30 mod 98, leading to D ≡ 10 mod 98.

But let me check that again.

Original equation: 98C - 199D = 68.

We had 199 ≡ 3 mod 98. Therefore, 199D ≡ 3D mod 98. Therefore, 98C ≡ 3D + 68 mod 98. But 98C ≡ 0 mod 98. Therefore, 0 ≡ 3D + 68 mod 98. Therefore, 3D ≡ -68 mod 98. Which is 3D ≡ 30 mod 98. Because -68 + 98 = 30. So yes, that is correct.

Therefore, 3D ≡ 30 mod 98. Divide both sides by 3: D ≡ 10 mod (98 / gcd(3,98)) = 98. Since gcd(3,98)=1. Therefore, D ≡ 10 mod 98. Therefore, D=10 + 98k. So, that is correct.

Therefore, the minimal D is 10, leading to C=21. Therefore, the original check is $10.21.

But wait, maybe there is another way to get a smaller check? For example, if the original check was in cents, maybe?

Wait, but the problem says "the smallest value for which the check could have been written." So, the value is in dollars and cents, so $10.21 is 10 dollars and 21 cents. But is there a smaller amount? For example, maybe a check with less than $10? But according to our equations, there isn't. But let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation?

Let me check again.

Original check: D dollars and C cents. So, total amount is D + C/100 dollars.

But the teller gave him C dollars and D cents, which is C + D/100 dollars.

Then, he spent 68 cents, so he has C + D/100 - 0.68 dollars.

This is equal to twice the original check: 2*(D + C/100).

So, in cents, original check is 100D + C cents.

The teller gave him 100C + D cents.

After spending 68 cents, he has 100C + D - 68 cents.

Which equals twice the original check: 2*(100D + C).

So, equation is 100C + D - 68 = 2*(100D + C). Which is the same as before.

So, 100C + D - 68 = 200D + 2C.

Then, 100C - 2C + D - 200D = 68.

Which is 98C - 199D = 68. Correct.

Therefore, the equation is correct.

Therefore, the solution D=10, C=21 is correct. So, the original check is $10.21. But let me check if there's a smaller solution where D and C are smaller. For example, maybe D= something else?

But according to our analysis, there isn't. But let me check with D= something else.

Suppose, for example, that the original check was $X.YZ, and after swapping, it's $YZ.X. Then, after spending 68 cents, it's twice the original.

But maybe there is another solution?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the interpretation of the check. Maybe the check was written as a certain amount, say, A dollars and B cents, but the teller gave him B dollars and A cents. So, the original check is A + B/100 dollars. The bank gave him B + A/100 dollars. Then, after spending 68 cents, he has B + A/100 - 0.68 = 2*(A + B/100). Which is the same equation as before.

So, maybe there's another way to think about it. Let me try plugging in numbers.

Suppose the original check was, say, $x. Then, the bank gave him $y. Then, y - 0.68 = 2x. Also, since the check was x dollars and some cents, and the bank gave y dollars and some cents, which is swapping dollars and cents.

But maybe think of x as dollars and cents. Let me think in terms of cents. Let me let x be the original check in cents: x = 100D + C.

Then, the bank gave him y = 100C + D cents.

Then, after spending 68 cents, he has y - 68 = 2x.

So, 100C + D - 68 = 2*(100D + C). Which is same equation as before.

So, same equation. Therefore, same solution.

Therefore, the answer is 100D + C = 10*100 + 21 = 1021 cents, which is $10.21.

But let me check if there is a smaller value. Suppose, for example, that there is another solution where D is 10, but C is smaller? But in our case, C=21 is forced by the equation. If D=10, then C=21. If D is smaller, then there is no solution. Therefore, $10.21 is the minimal.

But wait, the problem says "the smallest value for which the check could have been written." So, maybe the answer is 10.21? But I have a feeling that maybe there is a smaller check. Wait, let me check with D=10 and C=21, which is $10.21. Is there a check with, say, $5. something?

Wait, let me try D=5, then solving 98C = 199*5 + 68 = 995 + 68 = 1063. 1063 divided by 98 is approx 10.84, not integer. Similarly for D=6, 199*6 + 68 = 1194 + 68 = 1262. 1262 / 98 ≈12.87. Not integer. D=7: 199*7 + 68 = 1393 + 68 = 1461. 1461 / 98 ≈14.9. Not integer. D=8: 199*8 + 68 = 1592 + 68 = 1660. 1660 / 98 = 16.93... Not integer. D=9: 199*9 + 68 = 1791 + 68 = 1859. 1859 / 98 ≈18.96. Not integer. D=10: 2058 / 98 = 21. So yes. So, seems like D=10 is the first possible. Therefore, the answer is $10.21.

But wait, I remember that in some similar problems, the answer is different. Wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation?

Wait, let me check with D=10 and C=21. Original check: $10.21. The bank gives him $21.10. Then he spends 68 cents: 21.10 - 0.68 = 20.42. Which is twice $10.21. Correct.

But maybe there's another solution where the check is less than $10.21? For example, maybe D= something and C= something else?

Wait, let me think. Suppose that the original check was, say, $x, and after swapping, it's $y. Then y - 0.68 = 2x. Also, since y is the swapped amount, y = 100*(original cents) + original dollars. Wait, original check is x dollars and c cents. So, original amount is x + c/100. The swapped amount is c + x/100. Therefore, c + x/100 - 0.68 = 2*(x + c/100). Multiply both sides by 100 to eliminate decimals:

100c + x - 68 = 200x + 2c

Which is same as 98c - 199x = 68. Which is same equation as before. So, same equation. Therefore, same solution.

Therefore, the answer is indeed $10.21. Therefore, the minimal value is $10.21.

But let me check online if this problem is known. Wait, no, I can't do that. But I think that maybe this is correct. However, sometimes in these problems, there's a trick. Let me think again.

Suppose that the original check was, for example, $x.yz, and after swapping, it's $yz.x. Then, after spending 68 cents, he has twice the original. So, maybe there is a smaller check where, for example, the original check is less than $10.21. Let me try with D= something else. Let me think of the equation 98C - 199D = 68. Let me try to find other solutions. For example, if D= 10 + 98k, then C= (199D + 68)/98. For k=0, D=10, C=21. For k=1, D=108, C=(199*108 + 68)/98. Let me compute that again:

199*108: Let me compute 200*108 - 1*108 = 21600 - 108 = 21492. Then 21492 + 68 = 21560. Divided by 98: 21560 / 98. 98*220 = 21560. Therefore, C=220. But C must be less than 100, so invalid. Similarly, for k=-1, D= -88, invalid. Therefore, only solution is D=10, C=21. Therefore, original check is $10.21. Therefore, the answer is 10.21.

But let me check with another approach. Let me think of the difference between the swapped amount and the original amount. The swapped amount is 100C + D. Original amount is 100D + C. The difference is 100C + D - (100D + C) = 99C - 99D = 99(C - D). So, the swapped amount is 99(C - D) more than the original check. But according to the problem, after spending 68 cents, the swapped amount is twice the original check. Therefore:

Swapped amount - 68 = 2*(original check)

So:

Swapped amount = 2*(original check) + 68

But also, swapped amount = original check + 99(C - D)

Therefore:

original check + 99(C - D) = 2*(original check) + 68

Therefore:

original check - 99(C - D) = -68

Which is:

original check = 99(C - D) - 68

But original check is also 100D + C.

Therefore:

100D + C = 99(C - D) - 68

Let me expand the right side:

99C - 99D - 68

Therefore:

100D + C = 99C - 99D - 68

Bring all terms to left side:

100D + C - 99C + 99D + 68 = 0

Combine like terms:

(100D + 99D) + (C - 99C) + 68 = 0

Which is:

199D - 98C + 68 = 0

Which rearranged is:

199D - 98C = -68

Multiply both sides by -1:

98C - 199D = 68

Which is the same equation as before. Therefore, same equation. So, no new information. Therefore, the previous solution is correct.

Therefore, the answer is $10.21. Therefore, the minimal value is 10.21 dollars, which is 10 dollars and 21 cents. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{10.21}?

But wait, in some problems, they might expect the answer in cents or as a fraction? Wait, the problem says "the smallest value for which the check could have been written." The check is written in dollars and cents, so $10.21 is the value. However, sometimes problems like this expect the answer in cents, but the question says "value", so it's probably in dollars. However, let me check the problem statement again.

"Determine the smallest value for which the check could have been written."

Yes, so it's in dollars. But in the problem statement, when they say "the check", it's in dollars and cents, so the answer is $10.21. However, in some textbooks, they might write it as 10.21 dollars, but in the box, we need to put it as \boxed{10.21}?

But let me check if there's a smaller value. Wait, if the check was $10.21, that's 10 dollars and 21 cents. But maybe there is another check with a smaller amount where the cents are more than 100? No, because cents are less than 100. So, no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the interpretation of "the check could have been written". Maybe the check is written as a whole number of dollars and cents, so the answer is $10.21. Therefore, I think that is correct.

But let me check with D=10 and C=21. Original check: $10.21. The bank gave him $21.10. Then he spent 68 cents, so 21.10 - 0.68 = 20.42, which is twice 10.21. Correct. Therefore, this works. Therefore, the answer is $10.21.

But wait, I just thought of something. The problem says "the teller mistook the number of cents for the number of dollars and vice versa". So, if the check was, for example, $x.yz, then the teller would have given him yz.x dollars? Wait, but in our case, the original check is D dollars and C cents. So, the check is D dollars and C cents, which is D + C/100 dollars. The teller thought that the check was C dollars and D cents, which is C + D/100 dollars. Therefore, the equation is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the check was written as a single number, like, for example, if the check was $10.21, then the teller read it as 10 dollars and 21 cents, but mistook it as 21 dollars and 10 cents? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "the number of cents for the number of dollars and vice versa". So, if the check was, for example, written as "10 dollars and 21 cents", the teller read it as "21 dollars and 10 cents". So, that's what we have. Therefore, the equation is correct.

Therefore, I think the answer is $10.21. Therefore, the smallest value is \boxed{10.21}.

But wait, I just checked online (in my mind) that this problem is a classic one, and the answer is usually $10.21. But sometimes, depending on the problem's phrasing, maybe different. Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the check was $x, and after swapping, it's $y, and y - 0.68 = 2x. Also, y = 100*(original cents) + original dollars. Original check is x = original dollars + original cents / 100. So, if original check is D dollars and C cents, then x = D + C/100, y = C + D/100. Therefore, y - 0.68 = 2x => C + D/100 - 0.68 = 2D + 2C/100. Multiply by 100:

100C + D - 68 = 200D + 2C => 98C - 199D = 68. Same equation. So, same result.

Therefore, I think the answer is correct. Therefore, I think the answer is \boxed{10.21}.

**Final Answer**
The smallest value for which the check could have been written is \boxed{10.21}.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation where Mr. Smith cashed a check, but the teller **mistook the number of cents for the number of dollars and vice versa**. This means that if the check was written for **D dollars and C cents**, the teller gave him **C dollars and D cents**.

Let’s define:
- Original check amount: $ D $ dollars and $ C $ cents → total value is $ 100D + C $ cents.
- Amount given by the bank: $ C $ dollars and $ D $ cents → total value is $ 100C + D $ cents.
- After spending 68 cents, Mr. Smith had $ 100C + D - 68 $ cents.
- He noticed that this amount was **twice the original check**, so:
  $$
  100C + D - 68 = 2(100D + C)
  $$

---

### Step 1: Simplify the Equation

Start by expanding the right-hand side:
$$
100C + D - 68 = 200D + 2C
$$

Subtract $ 2C $ and $ D $ from both sides:
$$
98C - 199D = 68
$$

This is a **linear Diophantine equation** in two variables $ C $ and $ D $, with the constraint that:
- $ D $ is a non-negative integer (dollars),
- $ 0 \leq C < 100 $ (cents).

---

### Step 2: Solve the Diophantine Equation

We solve:
$$
98C - 199D = 68
$$

We can rearrange this as:
$$
98C = 199D + 68
$$

This implies that $ 199D + 68 $ must be divisible by 98. To find such values, we compute:
$$
199 \mod 98 = 3 \quad \text{(since } 199 = 2 \times 98 + 3)
$$

So the equation becomes:
$$
3D + 68 \equiv 0 \pmod{98}
\Rightarrow 3D \equiv -68 \pmod{98}
$$

Since $ -68 \equiv 30 \pmod{98} $, we have:
$$
3D \equiv 30 \pmod{98}
\Rightarrow D \equiv 10 \pmod{98}
$$

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution for $ D $ is:
$$
D = 10
$$

Substitute back into the original equation:
$$
98C = 199 \times 10 + 68 = 1990 + 68 = 2058
\Rightarrow C = \frac{2058}{98} = 21
$$

### Step 3: Verify the Solution

- Original check: $ D = 10 $, $ C = 21 $ → $ \$10.21 $
- Bank gave: $ C = 21 $, $ D = 10 $ → $ \$21.10 $
- After spending 68 cents: $ 21.10 - 0.68 = 20.42 $
- Twice the original check: $ 2 \times 10.21 = 20.42 $

The values match, confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 4: Check for Smaller Values

From the modular solution, the general form of $ D $ is:
$$
D = 10 + 98k
$$

For $ k = 0 $, $ D = 10 $, $ C = 21 $ → $ \$10.21 $

For $ k = -1 $, $ D = -88 $ (invalid, as dollars must be non-negative)

For $ k = 1 $, $ D = 108 $, $ C = 220 $ (invalid, as cents must be less than 100)

So, the **smallest valid value** is when $ D = 10 $, $ C = 21 $.

\boxed{10.21}
