Okay, so I need to use the Division Algorithm to prove these three statements about the forms of integers raised to different powers. Let me start by recalling what the Division Algorithm says. If I remember correctly, it states that for any integers a and b (with b > 0), there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r, where 0 ≤ r < b. So, essentially, any integer can be divided by another integer to get a quotient and a remainder, and the remainder is always less than the divisor.

Alright, so for part (a), we need to show that the square of any integer is either of the form 3k or 3k + 1. Let me think. Since we're dealing with squares modulo 3, maybe I can use the Division Algorithm to consider the possible remainders when an integer is divided by 3. Let me try that.

Any integer n can be expressed as 3q + r, where r is 0, 1, or 2. So, n is congruent to 0, 1, or 2 mod 3. Then, n squared would be (3q + r)^2. Let me compute that:

(3q + r)^2 = 9q² + 6qr + r². 

But since we're working modulo 3, the terms 9q² and 6qr are both multiples of 3, so they can be written as 3 times something. Therefore, n² ≡ r² mod 3. So, let's compute r² for r = 0, 1, 2.

- If r = 0: 0² = 0 mod 3. So n² ≡ 0 mod 3, which is 3k.
- If r = 1: 1² = 1 mod 3. So n² ≡ 1 mod 3, which is 3k + 1.
- If r = 2: 2² = 4. But 4 mod 3 is 1. So n² ≡ 1 mod 3, which is 3k + 1.

Wait, so regardless of whether the original number is congruent to 0, 1, or 2 mod 3, its square is either 0 or 1 mod 3. Therefore, the square is either 3k or 3k + 1. That seems to work. So part (a) is done. Let me check with examples. For example, 3 is 3*1 + 0, square is 9 = 3*3. 4 is 3*1 + 1, square is 16 = 3*5 + 1. 5 is 3*1 + 2, square is 25 = 3*8 + 1. Yep, that works. So that's part (a).

Now moving on to part (b): The cube of any integer has one of the forms 9k, 9k + 1, or 9k + 8. Hmm. So similar approach, maybe? Let me try using the Division Algorithm again. Let me consider integers modulo 9? Or maybe modulo 3 first? Wait, since the forms are modulo 9, maybe I should consider the possible remainders when an integer is divided by 3, since 9 is 3 squared. Alternatively, directly consider modulo 9.

But maybe it's better to first divide the integer by 3, since 9 is 3^2. Let me think. Let me consider n as an integer. By the Division Algorithm, n can be written as 3q + r, where r is 0, 1, or 2. Then n^3 is (3q + r)^3. Let me expand that:

(3q + r)^3 = 27q³ + 27q²r + 9qr² + r³. 

So, simplifying modulo 9, the terms 27q³, 27q²r, and 9qr² are all multiples of 9, so they vanish mod 9. Therefore, n³ ≡ r³ mod 9. Therefore, we need to compute r³ for r = 0, 1, 2.

- r = 0: 0³ = 0 mod 9. So n³ ≡ 0 mod 9, which is 9k.
- r = 1: 1³ = 1 mod 9. So n³ ≡ 1 mod 9, which is 9k + 1.
- r = 2: 2³ = 8 mod 9. So n³ ≡ 8 mod 9, which is 9k + 8.

Therefore, the cube of any integer is either 9k, 9k + 1, or 9k + 8. Let me check with examples. Take n = 0: 0³ = 0 = 9*0. n = 1: 1 = 9*0 + 1. n = 2: 8 = 9*0 + 8. n = 3: 27 = 9*3. n = 4: 64 = 9*7 + 1 (since 9*7=63, 64-63=1). n = 5: 125. Let's divide 125 by 9: 9*13=117, 125-117=8. So 125 = 9*13 + 8. Yep, that works. So that seems correct. Therefore, part (b) is done.

Now part (c): The fourth power of any integer is either of the form 5k or 5k + 1. Let me try similar approach. Again, using the Division Algorithm. Let me consider integers modulo 5. Any integer n can be written as 5q + r, where r is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Then n^4 is (5q + r)^4. Let me expand that. But maybe instead of expanding the whole thing, I can use modular arithmetic. Since we are looking at modulo 5, let me compute n^4 mod 5 for each possible r.

Alternatively, maybe using Fermat's little theorem? Wait, but since 5 is prime, for any integer n not divisible by 5, n^4 ≡ 1 mod 5. But if n is divisible by 5, then n^4 ≡ 0 mod 5. So that would mean that n^4 is either 0 mod 5 or 1 mod 5. Therefore, the fourth power is either 5k or 5k + 1. But wait, but the problem says "either of the form 5k or 5k + 1". So that would be correct? Let me check with examples.

But wait, let me verify if that's the case. Let me check for r = 0,1,2,3,4:

For r = 0: 0^4 = 0 mod 5. So 5k.

For r = 1: 1^4 = 1 mod 5. So 5k + 1.

For r = 2: 2^4 = 16. 16 mod 5 is 1. So 5k + 1.

For r = 3: 3^4 = 81. 81 mod 5 is 1 (since 80 is 5*16, so 81 is 1 mod 5). So again 5k + 1.

For r = 4: 4^4 = 256. 256 divided by 5 is 51*5 = 255, so 256 is 1 mod 5. Therefore, 5k + 1.

Therefore, indeed, for any integer n, n^4 is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 5. Therefore, it's either 5k or 5k + 1. So that's part (c).

Wait, but let me make sure that this is indeed using the Division Algorithm. The problem says "use the Division Algorithm to establish". So maybe I need to write it more formally, using the Division Algorithm. Let me try that.

So, for part (c), take any integer n. By the Division Algorithm, n can be written as 5q + r, where r ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. Then, n^4 = (5q + r)^4. Expanding this, we get terms with 5^4, 5^3, etc., but when we take modulo 5, all those terms vanish. Therefore, n^4 ≡ r^4 mod 5. Then, as shown above, r^4 mod 5 is 0, 1, 1, 1, 1. Therefore, n^4 ≡ 0 or 1 mod 5. Therefore, n^4 is either 5k or 5k + 1. So that's the proof.

Alternatively, maybe I need to do it without Fermat's little theorem? Well, since the problem says to use the Division Algorithm, which is more about division with remainder. So, the approach I took is correct. So that's part (c).

Wait, but maybe I should check for specific numbers. Let's take n = 2. 2^4 = 16. 16 divided by 5 is 3*5 + 1. So 5k + 1. n = 3: 81. 81 divided by 5 is 16*5 + 1. So same. n = 4: 256. 256 / 5 is 51*5 + 1. n = 5: 625. 625 /5 = 125. So 5k. n = 6: 6^4 = 1296. 1296 divided by 5 is 259*5 + 1. So yes, 5k + 1. So that seems to check out.

Therefore, all three parts are proven using the Division Algorithm. Let me just recap each part to make sure I didn't skip any steps.

For part (a), we considered n mod 3, then squared it, and saw that the square is 0 or 1 mod 3. For part (b), we considered n mod 3, then cubed it, and saw that the cube is 0, 1, or 8 mod 9. For part (c), we considered n mod 5, then raised to the 4th power, and saw that it's 0 or 1 mod 5. All of these rely on the Division Algorithm by expressing n as a multiple of the modulus plus a remainder, then using that to compute the power.

I think that's all. Let me check if there's any possible mistake. For example, in part (b), when I considered r=2, 2^3=8, which is 9k + 8. So that's correct. For part (c), even though 4^4 is 256, which is 1 mod 5, that's correct. So yes, I think that's all.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{3k} or \boxed{3k + 1}

(b) \boxed{9k}, \boxed{9k + 1}, or \boxed{9k + 8}

(c) \boxed{5k} or \boxed{5k + 1}

To establish the forms of integer powers using the **Division Algorithm**, we begin by considering the possible remainders when an integer is divided by a given modulus. The key idea is to express any integer $ n $ as:

$$
n = bq + r \quad \text{where } 0 \leq r < b
$$

Then, we compute the power $ n^k $ modulo $ b $, and deduce its form based on the possible values of $ r $.

### **(a) The square of any integer is either of the form $ 3k $ or $ 3k + 1 $**

By the Division Algorithm, any integer $ n $ can be written as:

$$
n = 3q + r, \quad \text{where } r \in \{0, 1, 2\}
$$

Squaring both sides:

$$
n^2 = (3q + r)^2 = 9q^2 + 6qr + r^2
$$

Modulo 3, the terms $ 9q^2 $ and $ 6qr $ are divisible by 3, so:

$$
n^2 \equiv r^2 \pmod{3}
$$

Now, compute $ r^2 \mod 3 $ for $ r = 0, 1, 2 $:

- $ r = 0 \Rightarrow r^2 = 0 \mod 3 $
- $ r = 1 \Rightarrow r^2 = 1 \mod 3 $
- $ r = 2 \Rightarrow r^2 = 4 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $

Thus, $ n^2 \equiv 0 $ or $ 1 \mod 3 $, which means $ n^2 $ is of the form $ 3k $ or $ 3k + 1 $.

---

### **(b) The cube of any integer has one of the forms: $ 9k $, $ 9k + 1 $, or $ 9k + 8 $**

Again, by the Division Algorithm:

$$
n = 3q + r, \quad r \in \{0, 1, 2\}
$$

Cubing both sides:

$$
n^3 = (3q + r)^3 = 27q^3 + 27q^2r + 9qr^2 + r^3
$$

Modulo 9, the first three terms are divisible by 9, so:

$$
n^3 \equiv r^3 \mod 9
$$

Now, compute $ r^3 \mod 9 $ for $ r = 0, 1, 2 $:

- $ r = 0 \Rightarrow r^3 = 0 \mod 9 $
- $ r = 1 \Rightarrow r^3 = 1 \mod 9 $
- $ r = 2 \Rightarrow r^3 = 8 \mod 9 $

Thus, $ n^3 \equiv 0, 1, $ or $ 8 \mod 9 $, so the cube of any integer is of the form $ 9k $, $ 9k + 1 $, or $ 9k + 8 $.

---

### **(c) The fourth power of any integer is either of the form $ 5k $ or $ 5k + 1 $**

By the Division Algorithm:

$$
n = 5q + r, \quad r \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}
$$

Raise both sides to the 4th power:

$$
n^4 = (5q + r)^4
$$

Modulo 5, all terms involving $ 5 $ will vanish, so:

$$
n^4 \equiv r^4 \mod 5
$$

Now, compute $ r^4 \mod 5 $ for $ r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 $:

- $ r = 0 \Rightarrow r^4 = 0 \mod 5 $
- $ r = 1 \Rightarrow r^4 = 1 \mod 5 $
- $ r = 2 \Rightarrow r^4 = 16 \equiv 1 \mod 5 $
- $ r = 3 \Rightarrow r^4 = 81 \equiv 1 \mod 5 $
- $ r = 4 \Rightarrow r^4 = 256 \equiv 1 \mod 5 $

Thus, $ n^4 \equiv 0 $ or $ 1 \mod 5 $, meaning $ n^4 $ is of the form $ 5k $ or $ 5k + 1 $.

---
