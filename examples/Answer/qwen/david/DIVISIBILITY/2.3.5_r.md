Okay, so I need to prove that for any integer a, at least one of the numbers a, a+2, or a+4 is divisible by 3. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can use modular arithmetic? Because divisibility by 3 is related to remainders when divided by 3.

First, let me recall that any integer a can be congruent to 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3. So, if I consider the possible residues of a mod 3, there are three cases. Maybe I can check each case separately and see if in each case one of the numbers a, a+2, or a+4 is divisible by 3.

Case 1: Suppose a ≡ 0 mod 3. Then a is divisible by 3. So, in this case, the statement is true because a itself is divisible by 3. That's straightforward.

Case 2: Suppose a ≡ 1 mod 3. Then let me compute a+2 and a+4 modulo 3. 

a ≡ 1 mod 3, so:

a + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. 

So, a + 2 is divisible by 3. Therefore, in this case, the statement holds.

Case 3: Suppose a ≡ 2 mod 3. Then let me compute a + 4 mod 3.

a + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 = 6 ≡ 0 mod 3. 

So, a + 4 is divisible by 3. Therefore, in this case, the statement also holds.

So, since all three cases are covered, and in each case at least one of the numbers a, a+2, or a+4 is divisible by 3, the statement is proven.

Wait, but let me check if there's another way to think about this. Maybe by considering the numbers a, a+2, a+4 as three numbers spaced by 2. Since 3 is the modulus, and the step between the numbers is 2, which is co-prime to 3? Wait, 2 and 3 are co-prime, so stepping by 2 mod 3 would cycle through residues. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe think of the three numbers as consecutive numbers with step 2. Since 3 is the modulus, if you have three numbers with step 2, they must cover all residues modulo 3? Let me check.

For example, if a is congruent to 0, then the numbers are 0, 2, 1 mod 3. If a is 1 mod 3, then the numbers are 1, 0, 2 mod 3. If a is 2 mod 3, then the numbers are 2, 1, 0 mod 3. So yes, in each case, the three numbers cover all residues mod 3. Therefore, one of them must be 0 mod 3. Therefore, one of them is divisible by 3. That seems like a more general argument.

So, since the three numbers a, a+2, a+4 are three numbers that are spaced by 2, and since 2 and 3 are coprime, they cover all residues modulo 3. Therefore, one of them must be congruent to 0 mod 3. Hence, divisible by 3. Therefore, the statement is proven.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle. Since there are three numbers and three residues mod 3, but since they are spaced by 2, which is not 1, but since 2 and 3 are coprime, the residues will be distinct? Wait, if you have three numbers with step 2, then their residues mod 3 would be a, a+2, a+4. But since 4 mod 3 is 1, so a+4 is a + 1 mod 3. Therefore, the residues are a, a+2, a+1 mod 3. So, if a is 0, then residues are 0, 2, 1. If a is 1, residues are 1, 0, 2. If a is 2, residues are 2, 1, 0. So, in any case, the three residues are 0,1,2. Therefore, one of them is 0. Therefore, one of the numbers is divisible by 3.

Therefore, regardless of the value of a, one of the numbers must be divisible by 3. Therefore, the statement is proven.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as follows: If we have three consecutive numbers, then one of them is divisible by 3. But here, the numbers are not consecutive, but spaced by 2. However, since 2 is co-prime to 3, stepping by 2 mod 3 cycles through all residues. Therefore, the three numbers will cover all residues mod 3, hence one of them must be 0 mod 3.

Alternatively, maybe think about the difference between the numbers. The numbers are a, a+2, a+4. The differences between them are 2 and 2. So, if you take three numbers with differences of 2, they are spaced such that they cover all residues mod 3. Hence, one must be divisible by 3.

But maybe I should check with examples. Let's take some integers and check.

Take a = 0: 0, 2, 4. 0 is divisible by 3. Check.

a = 1: 1, 3, 5. 3 is divisible by 3. Check.

a = 2: 2, 4, 6. 6 is divisible by 3. Check.

a = 3: 3, 5, 7. 3 is divisible by 3. Check.

a = 4: 4, 6, 8. 6 is divisible by 3. Check.

a = 5: 5, 7, 9. 9 is divisible by 3. Check.

a = 6: 6, 8, 10. 6 is divisible by 3. Check.

So, in all these examples, one of the numbers is divisible by 3. Therefore, the statement holds.

Alternatively, maybe think of it as the numbers a, a+2, a+4 are three numbers where two of them differ by 2, and since 3 is the modulus, if you have two numbers differing by 2, they can't both be congruent to 0 mod 3. But since there are three numbers, maybe one of them is 0.

Alternatively, think of the problem as: For any integer a, at least one of a, a+2, a+4 is divisible by 3. So, suppose that none of them is divisible by 3. Then, a ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3, a+2 ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3, a+4 ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3. But if a ≡ 1 mod 3, then a+2 ≡ 0 mod 3, which contradicts the assumption. Similarly, if a ≡ 2 mod 3, then a+4 ≡ 0 mod 3, which again contradicts the assumption. Therefore, the assumption that none of them is divisible by 3 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, at least one must be divisible by 3.

This is a proof by contradiction. Let me formalize that.

Assume that for some integer a, none of a, a+2, a+4 is divisible by 3. Then, a ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3.

Case 1: a ≡ 1 mod 3. Then, a + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. But this contradicts the assumption that none of them is divisible by 3. Therefore, this case is impossible.

Case 2: a ≡ 2 mod 3. Then, a + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 = 6 ≡ 0 mod 3. Again, this contradicts the assumption. Therefore, the assumption is false, so there must be at least one of a, a+2, a+4 divisible by 3.

Therefore, the statement is proven.

So, all these methods lead to the conclusion. Therefore, the statement is true for any integer a.

I think that's thorough. I considered multiple approaches: case analysis based on residues, using the pigeonhole principle, and proof by contradiction. All lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, the proof is correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
</think>

To prove that for any integer $ a $, at least one of the integers $ a $, $ a+2 $, or $ a+4 $ is divisible by 3, we can use modular arithmetic and case analysis.

### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Numbers

We are considering the three numbers:

$$
a, \quad a+2, \quad a+4
$$

These numbers are spaced by 2, and we are interested in their divisibility by 3. Since 3 is a small modulus, we can examine the possible remainders (i.e., residues modulo 3) that $ a $ can take.

Any integer $ a $ must satisfy:

$$
a \equiv 0, 1, \text{ or } 2 \pmod{3}
$$

---

### Step 2: Case Analysis Based on Residues

We examine each case separately.

#### **Case 1: $ a \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $**

In this case, $ a $ is divisible by 3. Therefore, the statement is clearly satisfied.

#### **Case 2: $ a \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $**

Then:

- $ a \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $
- $ a + 2 \equiv 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $

So, $ a + 2 $ is divisible by 3.

#### **Case 3: $ a \equiv 2 \pmod{3} $**

Then:

- $ a \equiv 2 \pmod{3} $
- $ a + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 = 6 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $

So, $ a + 4 $ is divisible by 3.

---

### Step 3: General Argument Using Modulo Arithmetic

The three numbers $ a $, $ a+2 $, and $ a+4 $ are spaced 2 units apart. Since $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ are coprime, adding 2 repeatedly modulo 3 will cycle through all residues modulo 3. That is, the three numbers will cover all three residues modulo 3: 0, 1, and 2.

Therefore, at least one of the numbers must be congruent to 0 modulo 3, which means it is divisible by 3.

---

### Step 4: Contradiction-Based Proof (Optional)

Assume that none of $ a $, $ a+2 $, or $ a+4 $ is divisible by 3. Then:

- $ a \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3} $, so $ a \equiv 1 $ or $ 2 \pmod{3} $
- If $ a \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $, then $ a + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $, a contradiction.
- If $ a \equiv 2 \pmod{3} $, then $ a + 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $, also a contradiction.

Thus, the assumption is false, and at least one of the numbers must be divisible by 3.

---

### Final Conclusion

In all cases, at least one of the numbers $ a $, $ a+2 $, or $ a+4 $ is divisible by 3. Therefore, the statement is always true for any integer $ a $.
