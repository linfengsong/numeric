Okay, so I need to prove that the cube of any integer is either of the form 7k, 7k + 1, or 7k - 1. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when dealing with modular arithmetic, especially with remainders, it's helpful to consider numbers modulo 7. Since we're dealing with cubes, maybe I can look at the possible residues of integers modulo 7 and then cube them to see what their residues are.

First, let me recall that any integer can be expressed as 7k + r, where r is the remainder when divided by 7. The possible values of r are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, if I take each of these residues, cube them, and then find their remainder modulo 7, that should give me the possible forms of the cube.

Let me write that down. Let's take each residue r from 0 to 6:

1. r = 0: (7k + 0)^3 = 343k^3. But 343 is 7^3, so this is 7*(49k^3), which is 7k. So, that's 7k. So, that's one case.

2. r = 1: (7k + 1)^3. Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem: (a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3. So here, a = 7k, b = 1. Therefore:

(7k)^3 + 3*(7k)^2*1 + 3*(7k)*(1)^2 + 1^3 = 343k^3 + 3*49k^2 + 21k + 1. 

Now, let's compute each term modulo 7. 343k^3 is 7^3k^3, which is 0 mod 7. Similarly, 3*49k^2 is 3*7^2k^2, which is also 0 mod 7. The term 21k is 3*7k, which is 0 mod 7. The last term is 1. Therefore, the entire expression is congruent to 1 mod 7. Therefore, (7k + 1)^3 ≡ 1 mod 7. So that's 7k + 1. So that's the second case.

3. r = 2: Let's compute (7k + 2)^3. Again, expanding:

(7k)^3 + 3*(7k)^2*2 + 3*(7k)*(2)^2 + 2^3. 

Calculating each term modulo 7:

First term: 343k^3 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Second term: 3*(49k^2)*2 = 3*2*49k^2 = 6*49k^2. Again, 49 is 7^2, so this term is 0 mod 7.

Third term: 3*(7k)*(4) = 12*7k. 12*7k is 84k, which is 0 mod 7.

Fourth term: 8. Now, 8 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 1. So 8 ≡ 1 mod 7. Therefore, the entire expression is congruent to 1 mod 7. Wait, but that's the same as when r=1? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check my calculation again.

Wait, (7k + 2)^3. Let me compute 2^3 mod 7. 2^3 is 8, which is 1 mod 7. So that's correct. But wait, but when I expanded it, I thought the other terms would vanish mod 7. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute (7k + 2)^3 mod 7. Since 7k ≡ 0 mod 7, so (0 + 2)^3 = 8 ≡ 1 mod 7. So that's correct. Therefore, (7k + 2)^3 ≡ 1 mod 7. Wait, so that would mean that both r=1 and r=2 give cubes congruent to 1 mod 7? But that seems odd. Let me check with actual numbers.

Take r=1: Let's take 1^3 = 1, which is 1 mod 7. Then 8^3 = 512. Let's divide 512 by 7. 7*73=511, so 512 is 1 mod 7. So that's 1 mod 7. Now take r=2: 2^3=8≡1 mod7. 9^3=729. 729 divided by 7: 7*104=728, so 729≡1 mod7. So yes, both 1^3 and 2^3 are 1 mod7. Interesting. So that's why. So that's why both residues 1 and 2 give 1 mod7. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says that the cube is of the form 7k, 7k+1, or 7k-1. So 7k-1 is equivalent to 7k + 6 mod7. So maybe I need to check other residues.

Continuing with r=3. Let's compute (7k + 3)^3 mod7. Again, since 7k ≡0 mod7, so (3)^3=27. 27 divided by 7 is 3*7=21, 27-21=6. So 27≡6 mod7. Therefore, (7k + 3)^3 ≡6 mod7. Which is equivalent to -1 mod7. Therefore, that is 7k -1. So that's the third case.

So that's 6 mod7, which is -1 mod7. Therefore, that's 7k -1.

Now r=4. Let's compute (7k +4)^3 mod7. Again, 4^3=64. 64 divided by 7: 7*9=63, so 64≡1 mod7. Therefore, (7k +4)^3 ≡1 mod7. Wait, same as before. So that's 1 mod7. So that would be 7k +1. So that's same as r=1 and r=2. Let me check with actual numbers. 4^3=64. 64-7*9=64-63=1. So yes, 1 mod7. 13^3=2197. 2197 divided by 7: 7*313=2191, 2197-2191=6. Wait, that's 6? Wait, wait, 13 mod7 is 6. Wait, 13 is 7*1 +6, so 13≡6 mod7. Wait, but I was talking about 4 mod7. Wait, maybe I confused something here.

Wait, no. If I take 4 mod7, then 4^3=64≡1 mod7. Let me check 14^3. 14 is 0 mod7. 14^3 is 2744. 2744 divided by 7 is 392, so 2744 is 0 mod7. Wait, but 14 is 0 mod7. Wait, but if I take 4 mod7, then 4^3≡1 mod7. Let me check 11^3. 11 is 4 mod7 (since 11-7=4). 11^3=1331. 1331 divided by 7: 7*190=1330, so 1331≡1 mod7. Correct. So that's 1 mod7. So that's 7k +1. So that's same as before.

Now, r=5. Let's compute (7k +5)^3 mod7. 5^3=125. 125 divided by 7: 7*17=119, 125-119=6. Therefore, 125≡6 mod7, which is -1 mod7. Therefore, (7k +5)^3≡6 mod7, which is -1 mod7. So that's 7k -1. Let me check with actual numbers. 5^3=125. 125-7*17=125-119=6. So 6 mod7. 12^3=1728. 1728 divided by 7: 7*246=1722, 1728-1722=6. So yes, 6 mod7. So that's 7k -1.

Finally, r=6. Let's compute (7k +6)^3 mod7. 6^3=216. 216 divided by 7: 7*30=210, 216-210=6. Therefore, 216≡6 mod7. Which is again -1 mod7. Therefore, (7k +6)^3≡6 mod7, which is -1 mod7. Let me check with actual numbers. 6^3=216. 216-7*30=216-210=6. Correct. 13^3=2197. 13 mod7 is 6. 2197 divided by 7: 7*313=2191, 2197-2191=6. Correct. So that's 6 mod7.

So summarizing:

For any integer n, n mod7 can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

Then, n^3 mod7 is:

- If n ≡0 mod7: 0^3=0 mod7 → 7k
- If n ≡1,2,4 mod7: 1^3=1, 2^3=8≡1, 4^3=64≡1 mod7 → 1 mod7 → 7k +1
- If n ≡3,5,6 mod7: 3^3=27≡6, 5^3=125≡6, 6^3=216≡6 mod7 → 6 mod7 → 7k -1

Therefore, the cube of any integer is congruent to 0, 1, or -1 modulo 7. Therefore, it can be written as 7k, 7k +1, or 7k -1. Therefore, the statement is proven.

But let me check if there's any mistake here. For example, when r=3, 3^3=27≡6≡-1 mod7. Similarly, r=5 and 6 also give -1. So that's correct.

So the conclusion is that the cube of any integer is of the form 7k, 7k+1, or 7k-1. Therefore, the statement is proven.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as follows: since modulo 7, the cubes can only be 0, 1, or 6 (which is -1). Therefore, the cube is either 7k, 7k+1, or 7k-1. Therefore, done.

I think this is correct. Let me check another example. Take n=3: 3^3=27. 27 divided by 7 is 3*7=21, remainder 6. So 27=7*3 +6=7*3 + (-1). So 7k -1. Correct. n=5: 125. 125 divided by 7 is 17*7=119, remainder 6. So 7*17 +6=7*17 + (-1). Correct. n=7: 343=7*49, which is 7k. Correct. n=8: 8^3=512. 512 divided by 7: 7*73=511, remainder 1. So 512=7*73 +1. Correct. n=9: 729. 7*104=728, remainder 1. So 7*104 +1. Correct. n=10: 1000. 1000 divided by 7: 7*142=994, remainder 6. So 7*142 +6=7*142 -1. Correct. So yes, all these examples check out.

Therefore, the conclusion is correct. Therefore, the cube of any integer is of the form 7k, 7k +1, or 7k -1.

**Final Answer**
The cube of any integer is of the form \boxed{7k}, \boxed{7k \pm 1}.

However, since the problem asks to put the final answer within a single box, maybe it's better to combine them. But the original question says "of the form 7k or 7k ± 1". So maybe the answer is that the cube is either 7k, 7k+1, or 7k-1. But how to box that? Maybe as three separate forms? But the user might expect a single box. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to show that it's one of those forms, so the answer is that it can be expressed as 7k, 7k+1, or 7k-1, so boxed as \boxed{7k}, \boxed{7k + 1}, and \boxed{7k - 1}. But the original instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Maybe the user expects a single box with the three forms? But standard practice is to have one box. Maybe the answer is that it is of the form 7k or 7k ±1, so the final answer is that the cube is of the form \boxed{7k}, \boxed{7k + 1}, or \boxed{7k - 1}. But since the user might expect a single box, maybe they want to write all three possibilities in one box. However, the original problem says "of the form 7k or 7k ± 1", so maybe the answer is that it can be written as 7k, 7k + 1, or 7k - 1, so the final answer is that the cube is of the form \boxed{7k}, \boxed{7k + 1}, or \boxed{7k - 1}. But since the user might want a single answer, maybe the problem is expecting to show that it's one of these forms, so the answer is that the cube is congruent to 0, 1, or -1 modulo 7, which corresponds to the forms given. However, since the problem says "of the form 7k or 7k ± 1", the answer is that it can be written as 7k, 7k+1, or 7k-1. Therefore, the final answer is that the cube is of the form \boxed{7k}, \boxed{7k + 1}, or \boxed{7k - 1}. But I need to check the instructions again. The user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Maybe the answer is that the cube is of the form 7k, 7k +1, or 7k -1, so the answer is \boxed{7k}, \boxed{7k + 1}, or \boxed{7k - 1}. However, since the user might expect a single box, but the problem says "of the form 7k or 7k ± 1", which is three forms. Maybe the answer is that the cube is congruent to 0, 1, or -1 modulo 7, but the question is about forms. Alternatively, since the problem says "of the form 7k or 7k ±1", maybe the answer is that it is one of these three forms, so the answer is that the cube is of the form \boxed{7k}, \boxed{7k + 1}, or \boxed{7k - 1}. But the user might expect a single box. Maybe the answer is that the cube is of the form 7k, 7k +1, or 7k -1, so boxed as \boxed{7k}, \boxed{7k + 1}, or \boxed{7k - 1}. But I think the original problem is expecting to show that the cube is one of these forms, so the answer is that the cube is of the form 7k, 7k +1, or 7k -1, so the final answer is that it can be written as \boxed{7k}, \boxed{7k + 1}, or \boxed{7k - 1}. However, since the user might have intended a single box, maybe I should check if there's a standard way. But given the problem says "of the form 7k or 7k ± 1", which is three forms. Therefore, the answer is those three forms. But the user might want to have all three in one box. Maybe using set notation? But I think the standard way is to write them as three separate boxed answers. However, since the original instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", maybe I need to check if there's a way to write all three in one box. Alternatively, since the problem is to show that the cube is of the form 7k or 7k ±1, then the answer is that it can be written as 7k, 7k +1, or 7k -1. Therefore, the final answer is that the cube is of the form \boxed{7k}, \boxed{7k + 1}, or \boxed{7k - 1}. But since the user might expect a single box, maybe they want to write all three possibilities in one box. However, I think in math problems, when they ask for the form, you can list them. But given the initial problem says "of the form 7k or 7k ± 1", which is three forms. Therefore, I think the correct way is to write them as three separate boxed answers. However, since the user might have a different expectation, but following the instructions, I'll put all three in separate boxes.

But looking back at the problem statement: "how that the cube of any integer is of the form 7k or 7k ± 1." So the answer is that it is of those forms, so the final answer is that it can be expressed as 7k, 7k +1, or 7k -1. Therefore, I think the correct way is to box each form, but since the user might expect a single answer, maybe the answer is that it is of the form 7k, 7k +1, or 7k -1, so boxed as \boxed{7k}, \boxed{7k + 1}, and \boxed{7k - 1}. However, since the user's instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", maybe they expect a single box. But I think in this case, since there are three possible forms, it's acceptable to have three boxes. Therefore, I'll proceed with that.

**Final Answer**
The cube of any integer is of the form \boxed{7k}, \boxed{7k + 1}, or \boxed{7k - 1}.

To prove that the cube of any integer is of the form $ 7k $, $ 7k + 1 $, or $ 7k - 1 $, we use **modular arithmetic** and analyze the cubes of all possible residues modulo 7.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Structure of Integers Modulo 7

Any integer $ n $ can be expressed in the form:

$$
n = 7k + r \quad \text{where } r \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
$$

We are interested in the value of $ n^3 \mod 7 $. So, we compute the cube of each residue modulo 7:

---

### Step 2: Compute $ r^3 \mod 7 $ for $ r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 $

| $ r $ | $ r^3 $ | $ r^3 \mod 7 $ |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| 0      | 0         | 0                |
| 1      | 1         | 1                |
| 2      | 8         | 1                |
| 3      | 27        | 6                |
| 4      | 64        | 1                |
| 5      | 125       | 6                |
| 6      | 216       | 6                |

---

### Step 3: Interpret the Results

From the table:

- $ r = 0 $: $ r^3 \equiv 0 \mod 7 $ → $ n^3 = 7k $
- $ r = 1, 2, 4 $: $ r^3 \equiv 1 \mod 7 $ → $ n^3 = 7k + 1 $
- $ r = 3, 5, 6 $: $ r^3 \equiv 6 \mod 7 $ → $ n^3 = 7k - 1 $

Thus, the cube of any integer $ n $ is congruent to **0**, **1**, or **-1** modulo 7, which corresponds to the forms:

- $ 7k $
- $ 7k + 1 $
- $ 7k - 1 $

---

### Final Conclusion

The cube of any integer is always of the form:

$$
\boxed{7k}, \boxed{7k + 1}, \text{ or } \boxed{7k - 1}
$$
