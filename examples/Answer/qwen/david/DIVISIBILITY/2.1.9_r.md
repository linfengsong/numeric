Okay, so I need to establish the identity $ t_x = t_y + t_z $ where $ x $, $ y $, and $ z $ are defined in terms of $ n $, and then use that to prove there are infinitely many triangular numbers that are the sum of two others. Then, part (b) asks for three examples. Let me start with part (a).

First, I remember that a triangular number is given by the formula $ t_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} $. So, $ t_x $, $ t_y $, and $ t_z $ would be triangular numbers with indices $ x $, $ y $, and $ z $ respectively. The problem says that $ x = \frac{n(n+3)}{2} + 1 $, $ y = n + 1 $, and $ z = \frac{n(n+3)}{2} $. So, I need to show that $ t_x = t_y + t_z $.

Let me write down each term:

First, compute $ t_x $:

$ t_x = \frac{x(x + 1)}{2} $

Substituting $ x $:

$ t_x = \frac{ \left( \frac{n(n+3)}{2} + 1 \right) \left( \frac{n(n+3)}{2} + 1 + 1 \right) }{2} $

Simplify the terms inside:

First, $ \frac{n(n+3)}{2} + 1 $ can be written as $ \frac{n(n+3) + 2}{2} $.

Similarly, $ \frac{n(n+3)}{2} + 1 + 1 = \frac{n(n+3)}{2} + 2 = \frac{n(n+3) + 4}{2} $.

Therefore, $ t_x = \frac{ \left( \frac{n(n+3) + 2}{2} \right) \left( \frac{n(n+3) + 4}{2} \right) }{2} $

Which simplifies to:

$ t_x = \frac{ [n(n+3) + 2][n(n+3) + 4] }{8} $

Now, let me compute $ t_y + t_z $:

$ t_y = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} $

$ t_z = \frac{z(z + 1)}{2} = \frac{ \left( \frac{n(n+3)}{2} \right) \left( \frac{n(n+3)}{2} + 1 \right) }{2} $

Again, let me compute that:

First, $ \frac{n(n+3)}{2} + 1 = \frac{n(n+3) + 2}{2} $, same as before.

So, $ t_z = \frac{ \left( \frac{n(n+3)}{2} \right) \left( \frac{n(n+3) + 2}{2} \right) }{2} $

Which simplifies to:

$ t_z = \frac{ n(n+3) [n(n+3) + 2] }{8} $

Therefore, $ t_y + t_z = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} + \frac{ n(n+3)[n(n+3) + 2] }{8} $

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should compute both $ t_x $ and $ t_y + t_z $ and see if they are equal.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let me try expanding $ t_x $ first.

Let me denote $ A = n(n + 3) $. Then:

$ t_x = \frac{(A/2 + 1)(A/2 + 2)}{2} $

Expanding that:

First, $ (A/2 + 1)(A/2 + 2) = (A/2)^2 + 3(A/2) + 2 $

So:

$ t_x = \frac{ (A^2)/4 + (3A)/2 + 2 }{2} = \frac{A^2}{8} + \frac{3A}{4} + 1 $

Now, compute $ t_y + t_z $:

First, $ t_y = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} $

Then, $ t_z = \frac{A(A + 2)}{8} $, since $ A = n(n + 3) $, so $ A + 2 = n(n + 3) + 2 $, which is the same as earlier.

Wait, but earlier I had:

$ t_z = \frac{ n(n+3)[n(n+3) + 2] }{8} $, which is $ \frac{A(A + 2)}{8} $.

Therefore, $ t_y + t_z = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} + \frac{A(A + 2)}{8} $

But $ A = n(n + 3) = n^2 + 3n $. Therefore, $ A + 2 = n^2 + 3n + 2 $, which is the same as the numerator in $ t_y $.

So, substituting:

$ t_y + t_z = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} + \frac{(n^2 + 3n)(n^2 + 3n + 2)}{8} $

Let me denote $ B = n^2 + 3n $, so that:

$ t_y + t_z = \frac{B + 2}{2} + \frac{B(B + 2)}{8} $

Now, let me compute this expression:

First term: $ \frac{B + 2}{2} $

Second term: $ \frac{B(B + 2)}{8} $

So, combining them:

$ \frac{B + 2}{2} + \frac{B(B + 2)}{8} = \frac{4(B + 2) + B(B + 2)}{8} $

Factor out $ B + 2 $:

$ \frac{(B + 2)(4 + B)}{8} $

Which is $ \frac{(B + 2)(B + 4)}{8} $

But $ B = n^2 + 3n $, so:

$ \frac{(n^2 + 3n + 2)(n^2 + 3n + 4)}{8} $

Wait, earlier I had for $ t_x $:

$ t_x = \frac{A^2}{8} + \frac{3A}{4} + 1 $, where $ A = n^2 + 3n $

But let me compute $ t_x $ again using the substitution.

Earlier, I had:

$ t_x = \frac{(A/2 + 1)(A/2 + 2)}{2} $

Which expanded to:

$ \frac{A^2}{8} + \frac{3A}{4} + 1 $

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as:

$ \frac{(A/2 + 1)(A/2 + 2)}{2} = \frac{(A/2 + 1)(A/2 + 2)}{2} $

But if I expand $ (A/2 + 1)(A/2 + 2) $, that's $ (A/2)^2 + 3(A/2) + 2 $, which is $ A^2/4 + 3A/2 + 2 $. Then divide by 2: $ A^2/8 + 3A/4 + 1 $, same as before.

But from the other approach, $ t_y + t_z = \frac{(B + 2)(B + 4)}{8} $, where $ B = A = n^2 + 3n $.

Therefore, $ t_x = \frac{A^2}{8} + \frac{3A}{4} + 1 $, and $ t_y + t_z = \frac{(A + 2)(A + 4)}{8} $

So, let me compute $ (A + 2)(A + 4) $:

$ (A + 2)(A + 4) = A^2 + 6A + 8 $

So, $ t_y + t_z = \frac{A^2 + 6A + 8}{8} = \frac{A^2}{8} + \frac{6A}{8} + 1 = \frac{A^2}{8} + \frac{3A}{4} + 1 $

Which is exactly equal to $ t_x $. Therefore, $ t_x = t_y + t_z $. Therefore, the identity is established. So that's part (a). Therefore, for any $ n \geq 1 $, this identity holds, which means that $ t_x $ is the sum of $ t_y $ and $ t_z $. Therefore, since there are infinitely many $ n $, there are infinitely many triangular numbers that are the sum of two other triangular numbers.

Now, part (b): Find three examples of triangular numbers that are sums of two other triangular numbers.

So, I need to pick specific values of $ n $, compute $ x $, $ y $, $ z $, then compute $ t_x $, $ t_y $, $ t_z $, and check that $ t_x = t_y + t_z $.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute for small values of $ n $, starting from n=1, 2, 3, etc.

Let me try n=1:

First, compute x, y, z:

For n=1:

x = [1*(1+3)]/2 + 1 = [4]/2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

y = 1 + 1 = 2

z = [1*(1+3)]/2 = 4/2 = 2

Therefore, t_x = t_3 = 3*4/2 = 6

t_y = t_2 = 2*3/2 = 3

t_z = t_2 = 3

Then t_y + t_z = 3 + 3 = 6 = t_x. So that works. So 6 is a triangular number which is the sum of 3 and 3. But 3 is itself a triangular number. So 6 is the sum of two triangular numbers (3 and 3). However, the problem says "two other such numbers", so maybe they need to be different? Wait, the problem says "the sum of two other triangular numbers". So, "other" might mean different from the number itself? Or just different from each other? Wait, but in this case, t_y and t_z are both 3, which is the same. So maybe that's allowed? Or maybe they need to be different? The problem says "two other such numbers", so maybe "other" meaning different from the number itself. But in this case, t_x is 6, and t_y and t_z are both 3, which are different from 6. So maybe that's acceptable. But maybe the problem wants two different triangular numbers. However, the problem didn't specify that they need to be different, so perhaps this is a valid example.

But maybe the problem wants examples where the two triangular numbers are different. Let me check for n=2.

For n=2:

x = [2*(2+3)]/2 + 1 = [10]/2 + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6

y = 2 + 1 = 3

z = [2*(2+3)]/2 = 10/2 = 5

Therefore, t_x = t_6 = 6*7/2 = 21

t_y = t_3 = 3*4/2 = 6

t_z = t_5 = 5*6/2 = 15

So, t_y + t_z = 6 + 15 = 21 = t_x. So that works. Here, t_y = 6 and t_z = 15, which are different from each other and from t_x=21. So that's a good example.

For n=3:

x = [3*(3+3)]/2 + 1 = [18]/2 +1 = 9 + 1 = 10

y = 3 + 1 = 4

z = [3*(3+3)]/2 = 18/2 = 9

t_x = t_10 = 10*11/2 = 55

t_y = t_4 = 4*5/2 = 10

t_z = t_9 = 9*10/2 = 45

t_y + t_z = 10 + 45 = 55 = t_x. So that works. So 55 is the sum of 10 and 45. Again, different numbers.

So, for n=1, 2, 3, we have examples. However, for n=1, the two triangular numbers are the same. But maybe the problem allows that. However, maybe they want three examples where the two triangular numbers are different. So, n=2 and n=3 give examples where they are different. Let me check n=4.

n=4:

x = [4*(4+3)]/2 +1 = [28]/2 +1 = 14 +1 = 15

y = 4 +1 = 5

z = [4*(4+3)]/2 = 28/2 =14

t_x = t_15 = 15*16/2 = 120

t_y = t_5 = 15

t_z = t_14 = 14*15/2 = 105

t_y + t_z = 15 + 105 = 120 = t_x. So that works.

So, 120 is the sum of 15 and 105. So that's another example.

So, if I take n=1, 2, 3, 4, etc., each gives a different example. However, the problem says "three examples", so maybe pick three different ones. For example, n=1, n=2, n=3. But for n=1, the two triangular numbers are the same. Maybe the problem is okay with that. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects different numbers. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says "three examples of triangular numbers that are sums of two other triangular numbers." So, "other" might just mean different from the number itself, not necessarily different from each other. However, in the case of n=1, t_y and t_z are both 3, which are different from t_x=6. So, that's acceptable. However, maybe the problem expects two distinct triangular numbers. But since the problem didn't specify, maybe we can include that. However, maybe the problem expects examples where the two triangular numbers are different. So, maybe n=2, 3, 4.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is okay with n=1. Let me check the first example. For n=1, t_x=6 is the sum of t_y=3 and t_z=3. So, 6 is a triangular number which is the sum of two triangular numbers (3 and 3). But 3 is also a triangular number. So, that's valid. However, maybe the problem wants examples where the two numbers are different. But since the problem didn't specify, perhaps it's okay. However, maybe the question is looking for three examples where the two numbers are different. So, for n=2, 3, 4, we have examples where the two numbers are different.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is okay with n=1. Let me check if there's any issue with that. For example, 6 is a triangular number, and it's the sum of two triangular numbers (3 and 3). However, 3 is also a triangular number, so that's a valid example.

But maybe the problem wants three examples where the two numbers are different. So, for example, 21 (from n=2), 55 (from n=3), and 120 (from n=4). Therefore, those three examples.

Alternatively, maybe the problem allows n=1 as well. So, three examples could be 6, 21, 55. However, 6 is the sum of two 3s, but 21 is sum of 6 and 15, 55 is sum of 10 and 45.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants three examples where the two numbers are different. So, 21, 55, 120. Let me check the problem statement again. It says "three examples of triangular numbers that are sums of two other triangular numbers." So, the key is that the triangular number is the sum of two other triangular numbers. The two other triangular numbers can be same or different. So, for example, 6 is the sum of two triangular numbers (3 and 3). So, that's valid. Therefore, maybe all three examples can be n=1, 2, 3. But maybe the problem expects different numbers. But the problem didn't specify. So, perhaps I can just pick three examples from n=1, 2, 3, 4.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the two triangular numbers are different. For example, 6 is the sum of 3 and 3. But maybe the problem wants two distinct triangular numbers. However, the problem says "two other triangular numbers", so maybe "other" meaning different from the number itself. So, if the triangular number is t_x, then the two numbers are t_y and t_z, which are different from t_x. So, in the case of n=1, t_x=6, and t_y and t_z are 3, which are different from 6. So that's acceptable. Therefore, 6 is a valid example.

Therefore, three examples could be:

1. 6 = 3 + 3

2. 21 = 6 + 15

3. 55 = 10 + 45

Alternatively, 120 = 15 + 105. So, three examples.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the triangular numbers to be different from each other. But since the problem didn't specify, I think all three are valid. However, maybe the problem expects different examples. Let me check the first example again. For n=1, 6 is a triangular number. 3 is also a triangular number. So, 6 is the sum of two triangular numbers. So, that's valid.

Therefore, three examples are 6, 21, 55, or 6, 21, 120, etc. But to be safe, maybe pick three different ones where the two numbers are different. For example, 21, 55, 120.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the triangular numbers to be different from each other and from the sum. But in the case of n=1, t_y and t_z are same, but they are different from t_x. So, that's okay.

Therefore, I can present three examples. Let me check if there are other examples. For example, n=5:

x = [5*(5+3)]/2 +1 = [40]/2 +1 = 20 +1 =21

y=5+1=6

z= [5*(5+3)]/2=20

t_x = t_21 = 21*22/2= 231

t_y = t_6=21

t_z = t_20= 20*21/2=210

t_y + t_z=21 + 210=231. So that works. So 231 is another example.

So, if I take n=1, 2, 3, then 6, 21, 55. So, three examples.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants three different examples where the two triangular numbers are different. So, 21, 55, 120. So, those are three examples.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the triangular numbers to be different from each other and from the sum. But in the case of n=1, the two numbers are same, but they are different from the sum. So, I think that's acceptable.

Therefore, for part (b), three examples are:

- 6 = 3 + 3

- 21 = 6 + 15

- 55 = 10 + 45

Alternatively, 6, 21, 55. But maybe the problem wants the numbers to be different. However, the problem didn't specify. So, I think that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants examples where the two triangular numbers are not the same. So, for example, 21, 55, 120. So, those are three examples where the two triangular numbers are different.

Therefore, I can present those three.

So, to answer part (a), we have established the identity, and part (b), three examples are 21, 55, 120.

But let me check if these numbers are indeed triangular numbers. For example:

21: t_6 = 6*7/2 = 21. Yes.

55: t_10 = 10*11/2 = 55. Yes.

120: t_15 = 15*16/2 = 120. Yes.

And 21 = t_6 = t_3 + t_5 = 6 + 15 = 21. 55 = t_4 + t_9 = 10 + 45 = 55. 120 = t_5 + t_14 = 15 + 105 = 120. So, yes.

Alternatively, for 6 = t_3 = t_2 + t_2 = 3 + 3. So, that's also valid.

Therefore, the three examples can be 6, 21, 55, or 21, 55, 120, etc.

But since the problem says "three examples", I can choose any three. So, maybe the first three: 6, 21, 55. But maybe the problem expects them to be different from each other. But since 6 is a smaller number, maybe that's okay.

Alternatively, to make sure, maybe the problem expects the examples to be non-trivial, i.e., not the same number. But since the problem didn't specify, I think it's safe.

Therefore, the answer for part (b) is three examples: 6, 21, 55. Or 21, 55, 120. Let me check if 6 is considered a valid example. Since the problem says "triangular numbers that are the sum of two other triangular numbers", and 6 is indeed such a number. So, yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the two numbers to be different. For example, 6 is the sum of two same numbers. But in mathematics, the term "sum of two numbers" doesn't require them to be different. So, 6 is a valid example.

But maybe the problem expects different numbers. However, since the problem didn't specify, I think it's okay.

Therefore, I can present three examples: 6, 21, 55. Alternatively, to have three different examples with different numbers, maybe 6, 21, 55.

But to be thorough, let me check if there are other examples. For n=1, 6. For n=2, 21. For n=3, 55. For n=4, 120. So, those are four examples. So, three of them can be selected.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the sum to be a triangular number that is not the sum of the same number twice. But again, the problem didn't specify.

In conclusion, for part (a), we have established the identity, and for part (b), three examples are 6, 21, 55.

**Final Answer**

(a) The identity is established, proving there are infinitely many triangular numbers that are the sum of two others.  
(b) Three examples are \boxed{6}, \boxed{21}, and \boxed{55}.
</think>

To address the problem, we first analyze the identity involving triangular numbers and then use it to construct specific examples.

---

### **Part (a): Establishing the Identity**

We are given the following definitions:

- $ x = \frac{n(n+3)}{2} + 1 $
- $ y = n + 1 $
- $ z = \frac{n(n+3)}{2} $

We are to prove the identity:
$$
t_x = t_y + t_z
$$
where $ t_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} $ is the $ k $-th triangular number.

Let us compute both sides of the identity.

#### **Compute $ t_x $:**
$$
t_x = \frac{x(x+1)}{2}
$$
Substitute $ x = \frac{n(n+3)}{2} + 1 $:
$$
x = \frac{n(n+3) + 2}{2}
$$
$$
x + 1 = \frac{n(n+3) + 4}{2}
$$
$$
t_x = \frac{ \left( \frac{n(n+3) + 2}{2} \right) \left( \frac{n(n+3) + 4}{2} \right) }{2}
= \frac{(n(n+3)+2)(n(n+3)+4)}{8}
$$

#### **Compute $ t_y + t_z $:**
$$
t_y = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}
$$
$$
t_z = \frac{z(z+1)}{2} = \frac{ \left( \frac{n(n+3)}{2} \right) \left( \frac{n(n+3)}{2} + 1 \right) }{2}
= \frac{n(n+3)(n(n+3)+2)}{8}
$$
$$
t_y + t_z = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} + \frac{n(n+3)(n(n+3)+2)}{8}
$$

Let $ A = n(n+3) $, then:
$$
t_y = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} = \frac{A + 2}{2}
$$
$$
t_z = \frac{A(A + 2)}{8}
$$
$$
t_y + t_z = \frac{A + 2}{2} + \frac{A(A + 2)}{8} = \frac{(A + 2)(A + 4)}{8}
$$

Now compare with the earlier expression for $ t_x $:
$$
t_x = \frac{(A + 2)(A + 4)}{8}
$$

Thus, we have:
$$
t_x = t_y + t_z
$$

This identity holds for all $ n \geq 1 $, which implies there are **infinitely many triangular numbers** that are the sum of two other triangular numbers.

---

### **Part (b): Examples of Triangular Numbers That Are the Sum of Two Others**

Using the identity, we can generate examples by plugging in small values of $ n $.

#### **Example 1: $ n = 1 $**
- $ x = \frac{1(4)}{2} + 1 = 3 $
- $ y = 2 $
- $ z = \frac{1(4)}{2} = 2 $

$$
t_x = t_3 = \frac{3 \cdot 4}{2} = 6 \\
t_y = t_2 = \frac{2 \cdot 3}{2} = 3 \\
t_z = t_2 = 3 \\
t_y + t_z = 3 + 3 = 6 = t_x
$$

✅ **Example 1: $ 6 = 3 + 3 $**

#### **Example 2: $ n = 2 $**
- $ x = \frac{2(5)}{2} + 1 = 6 $
- $ y = 3 $
- $ z = \frac{2(5)}{2} = 5 $

$$
t_x = t_6 = \frac{6 \cdot 7}{2} = 21 \\
t_y = t_3 = 6 \\
t_z = t_5 = \frac{5 \cdot 6}{2} = 15 \\
t_y + t_z = 6 + 15 = 21 = t_x
$$

✅ **Example 2: $ 21 = 6 + 15 $**

#### **Example 3: $ n = 3 $**
- $ x = \frac{3(6)}{2} + 1 = 10 $
- $ y = 4 $
- $ z = \frac{3(6)}{2} = 9 $

$$
t_x = t_{10} = \frac{10 \cdot 11}{2} = 55 \\
t_y = t_4 = 10 \\
t_z = t_9 = \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 45 \\
t_y + t_z = 10 + 45 = 55 = t_x
$$

✅ **Example 3: $ 55 = 10 + 45 $**

---

### **Final Answer**

(a) The identity $ t_x = t_y + t_z $ is established, proving that there are infinitely many triangular numbers that are the sum of two other triangular numbers.

(b) Three examples of triangular numbers that are the sum of two other triangular numbers are:

$$
\boxed{6}, \quad \boxed{21}, \quad \boxed{55}
$$
