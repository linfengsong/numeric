Okay, so I need to find the greatest common divisors (gcd) for three pairs of numbers: (143, 227), (306, 657), and (272, 1479). Hmm, I remember that the gcd is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. To find it, I think the Euclidean algorithm is the way to go. Let me recall how that works. 

First, for each pair, I need to apply the Euclidean algorithm. The steps are: divide the larger number by the smaller one, take the remainder, then repeat the process with the smaller number and the remainder, and so on until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the gcd. Let me try this step by step for each pair.

Starting with the first pair: 143 and 227. Let me check which one is larger. 227 is larger than 143. So, I'll divide 227 by 143. Let me do that division. 143 times 1 is 143, subtract that from 227, the remainder is 227 - 143 = 84. So now, according to the Euclidean algorithm, I need to find gcd(143, 84). 

Now, 143 divided by 84. 84 times 1 is 84, subtract that from 143, remainder is 143 - 84 = 59. So now it's gcd(84, 59). 

Next step: divide 84 by 59. 59 times 1 is 59, subtract from 84, remainder is 84 - 59 = 25. Now, gcd(59, 25).

Divide 59 by 25. 25 times 2 is 50, subtract from 59, remainder is 59 - 50 = 9. Now, gcd(25, 9).

Divide 25 by 9. 9 times 2 is 18, subtract from 25, remainder is 25 - 18 = 7. Now, gcd(9, 7).

Divide 9 by 7. 7 times 1 is 7, subtract from 9, remainder is 2. Now, gcd(7, 2).

Divide 7 by 2. 2 times 3 is 6, subtract from 7, remainder is 1. Now, gcd(2, 1).

Divide 2 by 1. 1 times 2 is 2, remainder is 0. So the last non-zero remainder is 1. Therefore, gcd(143, 227) is 1. Wait, so they are coprime? Let me check if that's correct. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations? Let me verify.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor both numbers. Let's see. 143: 11 times 13 is 143? 11*13 is 143, yes. 227: Hmm, is 227 a prime? Let me check. Let me try dividing by small primes. 2? No, it's odd. 3? 2+2+7=11, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7, no. 7? 7*32 is 224, 227-224=3, not divisible by 7. 11? 11*20 is 220, 227-220=7, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*17 is 221, 227-221=6, not divisible by 13. 17? 17*13 is 221, same as before. 19? 19*11 is 209, 19*12 is 228, which is higher. So 227 is prime. Therefore, since 143 factors into 11 and 13, and 227 is prime and not a factor of 143, their gcd is indeed 1. So that seems correct. Okay, so first answer is 1.

Moving on to the second pair: 306 and 657. Let me apply the Euclidean algorithm here. First, divide 657 by 306. Let me calculate how many times 306 goes into 657. 306*2 is 612, subtract that from 657, remainder is 657 - 612 = 45. So now, gcd(306, 45).

Next step: divide 306 by 45. 45*6 is 270, subtract from 306, remainder is 306 - 270 = 36. Now, gcd(45, 36).

Divide 45 by 36. 36*1 is 36, subtract from 45, remainder is 9. Now, gcd(36, 9).

Divide 36 by 9. 9*4 is 36, remainder is 0. So the last non-zero remainder is 9. Therefore, gcd(306, 657) is 9. Let me check if that's correct by factoring. 

Factor 306: 306 divided by 2 is 153. 153 divided by 3 is 51, divided by 3 again is 17. So 306 is 2 * 3^2 * 17.

Factor 657: 657 divided by 3 is 219. Divided by 3 again is 73. So 657 is 3^2 * 73. Therefore, the common factors are 3^2, which is 9. Yes, that matches. So that's correct. So the second gcd is 9.

Third pair: 272 and 1479. Let me apply the Euclidean algorithm again. First, divide 1479 by 272. Let me compute how many times 272 goes into 1479. Let me do 272*5 is 1360. Subtract that from 1479: 1479 - 1360 = 119. So now, gcd(272, 119).

Next step: divide 272 by 119. 119*2 is 238. Subtract from 272: 272 - 238 = 34. Now, gcd(119, 34).

Divide 119 by 34. 34*3 is 102. Subtract from 119: 119 - 102 = 17. Now, gcd(34, 17).

Divide 34 by 17. 17*2 is 34, remainder 0. So the last non-zero remainder is 17. Therefore, gcd(272, 1479) is 17. Let me check by factoring.

Factor 272: 272 divided by 2 is 136, divided by 2 again is 68, again by 2 is 34, again by 2 is 17. So 2^4 * 17.

Factor 1479: Let me see. 1479 divided by 3: 1+4+7+9 = 21, which is divisible by 3. 1479 / 3 is 493. Now check 493. Let me try dividing by small primes. 493 divided by 17? 17*29 is 493? 17*29 is 493? Let me check 17*20 is 340, 17*29 is 340 + 17*9 = 340 + 153 = 493. Yes! So 1479 is 3 * 17 * 29. Therefore, the common factor is 17. So gcd is 17. Correct. So that's the third answer.

Therefore, the three gcds are 1, 9, and 17.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the steps. Let me go through each step again for the third pair.

First step: 1479 divided by 272. 272*5 is 1360, 1479 - 1360 is 119. Correct. Then 272 divided by 119: 119*2 is 238, 272 - 238 is 34. Then 119 divided by 34: 34*3 is 102, 119 - 102 is 17. Then 34 divided by 17 is 2 with 0 remainder. So yes, the gcd is 17. Correct.

Another check: 272 and 1479. 17 divides 272? 17*16 is 272, yes. 17 divides 1479? 17*87 is 1479? Let me check 17*80 is 1360, 17*7 is 119, so 1360 + 119 = 1479. Yes. So 17 is a common divisor. And since in the Euclidean steps we found that it's the gcd, that's correct.

So all three answers are 1, 9, 17. Therefore, I think that's the correct result.

**Final Answer**
The gcds are $\boxed{1}$, $\boxed{9}$, and $\boxed{17}$.
