Okay, so I need to derive the formula for the sum of triangular numbers, which is given as t₁ + t₂ + t₃ + ... + tₙ = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6. Hmm, triangular numbers... Right, the nth triangular number is the sum of the first n natural numbers. So tₙ = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2. Therefore, the sum of the first n triangular numbers would be the sum from k=1 to n of [k(k + 1)/2]. 

So maybe I can start by writing that sum out. Let me write that down:

Sum = Σₖ=1ⁿ [k(k + 1)/2] = (1/2) Σₖ=1ⁿ [k² + k] = (1/2)(Σₖ=1ⁿ k² + Σₖ=1ⁿ k)

I remember there are formulas for both Σk and Σk². The sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n + 1)/2, and the sum of the squares is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Let me confirm that... Yeah, I think that's right. So substituting those into the equation:

Sum = (1/2)[n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 + n(n + 1)/2]

Hmm, let me compute that. First, let me factor out n(n + 1) from both terms inside the brackets. So:

Sum = (1/2)[n(n + 1)( (2n + 1)/6 + 1/2 ) ]

Now, let me compute the expression inside the parentheses. Let me get a common denominator for the two terms. The denominators are 6 and 2, so common denominator is 6. So:

(2n + 1)/6 + 1/2 = (2n + 1)/6 + 3/6 = (2n + 1 + 3)/6 = (2n + 4)/6 = (2(n + 2))/6 = (n + 2)/3

So substituting back into the Sum expression:

Sum = (1/2)[n(n + 1)(n + 2)/3] = [n(n + 1)(n + 2)] / 6

Which is exactly the formula given! So that seems to check out. But wait, the problem mentions that this formula is attributed to Aryabhata. But I just used standard formulas for Σk and Σk². Maybe there's another way to derive this formula that Aryabhata might have used, perhaps without using those standard formulas? Or maybe it's just a matter of using the known formulas?

Alternatively, maybe there's a combinatorial interpretation. Let me think. The formula n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6 is the same as C(n + 2, 3), the number of combinations of n + 2 things taken 3 at a time. But how does that relate to the sum of triangular numbers?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to think about the triangular numbers as layers or something. Let me recall that the triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15,... and their sum is 1, 4, 10, 20, 35,... which are the tetrahedral numbers. So the sum of the first n triangular numbers is the nth tetrahedral number. And the formula for tetrahedral numbers is indeed n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6. So that's another way to think about it.

But how would Aryabhata have derived this? Maybe he used a method of induction or some geometric reasoning?

Alternatively, maybe he used the formula for the sum of triangular numbers by considering the sum of the first n triangular numbers as a 3-dimensional figure. For example, each triangular number can be thought of as a 2D triangle, and stacking them would form a 3D shape, which can be counted in a certain way.

Alternatively, maybe he used a method similar to the one I did earlier, using the known formulas for Σk and Σk². But if that's the case, then maybe that's the standard way. However, since the problem says "derive the formula", perhaps the expected method is the one I did, using the standard formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of integers.

But let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the sum of triangular numbers:

Sum = Σₖ=1ⁿ [k(k + 1)/2] = 1/2 Σₖ=1ⁿ (k² + k) = 1/2 [Σk² + Σk]

Then, Σk from 1 to n is n(n + 1)/2, and Σk² is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. So substituting:

Sum = 1/2 [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 + n(n + 1)/2]

Factor out n(n + 1)/2:

Wait, let me check that step again. Let me compute the two terms:

First term: n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6

Second term: n(n + 1)/2 = n(n + 1)*3/6

So adding them together: [n(n + 1)(2n + 1) + 3n(n + 1)] / 6

Factor out n(n + 1):

n(n + 1)[(2n + 1) + 3]/6 = n(n + 1)(2n + 4)/6 = n(n + 1)(2(n + 2))/6 = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/3

Then multiply by 1/2: [n(n + 1)(n + 2)/3] * 1/2 = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6. Yep, that's correct.

So that seems to be the derivation. But maybe Aryabhata had a different approach? Maybe using recursion or some other method?

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the sum of the first n triangular numbers by considering the formula for the tetrahedral numbers. But I think the derivation I did is valid and straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe using mathematical induction. Let me try that as another approach to verify.

Base case: n = 1. The sum is t₁ = 1. The formula gives 1*(1 + 1)*(1 + 2)/6 = 1*2*3/6 = 6/6 = 1. Correct.

Assume it's true for n = k, so Sum_{i=1}^k t_i = k(k + 1)(k + 2)/6.

Then for n = k + 1, the sum would be Sum_{i=1}^{k + 1} t_i = Sum_{i=1}^k t_i + t_{k + 1} = [k(k + 1)(k + 2)/6] + [(k + 1)(k + 2)/2]

Let me compute that:

= [k(k + 1)(k + 2)/6] + [(k + 1)(k + 2)/2]

Factor out (k + 1)(k + 2)/6:

= (k + 1)(k + 2)/6 [k + 3]

= (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3)/6

Which is the formula for n = k + 1. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1. So that's another way to derive it.

But the problem says "derive the formula", so maybe either method is acceptable. However, since the question mentions Aryabhata, perhaps the original derivation was more combinatorial or geometric?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to think of the triangular numbers as layers and then counting the total number of objects in a 3D structure. For example, each triangular number is a 2D triangle, and stacking them would form a tetrahedron. The number of objects in a tetrahedron with n layers is the same as the sum of triangular numbers.

But how would you count that? Let me think. A tetrahedron with n layers would have 1 object in the first layer, 3 in the second, 6 in the third, etc., up to the nth layer. So the total is the sum we are trying to find.

Alternatively, think of the number of ways to choose 3 items from n + 2 items. Wait, the formula is n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6, which is C(n + 2, 3). So maybe there's a combinatorial argument here.

Let me try that. Suppose we want to count the number of ways to choose 3 distinct numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n + 2}. Alternatively, think of the numbers as positions in a line. But how does that relate to the sum of triangular numbers?

Alternatively, think of the triangular numbers as the number of ways to choose 2 items from n + 1 items. Wait, t_n = C(n + 1, 2). Therefore, the sum of t_1 + t_2 + ... + t_n is the sum_{k=1}^n C(k + 1, 2). Then, there is a formula for the sum of combinations. In general, sum_{k=0}^n C(k + m, m) = C(n + m + 1, m + 1). Is that correct? Let me check for m = 2. Then sum_{k=0}^n C(k + 2, 2) = C(n + 3, 3). So if we take sum_{k=1}^n C(k + 1, 2) = sum_{k=2}^{n + 1} C(k, 2) = C(n + 2, 3). Which is exactly our formula. Therefore, the sum_{k=1}^n t_k = C(n + 2, 3) = (n + 2)(n + 1)n / 6. Which is the same as the formula given.

So that's a combinatorial proof. So maybe Aryabhata used this combinatorial argument? But I'm not sure about the historical context. However, this seems like a valid way to derive the formula.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of adding layers. For example, imagine building a tetrahedron where each layer is a triangular number. The first layer (n=1) is 1, the second layer (n=2) adds 3, making 4, then adding 6 to get 10, etc. But how to count the total number of objects?

Alternatively, think of the tetrahedron as a 3D shape where each edge has length n. The number of unit cubes in such a tetrahedron would be the same as the sum of triangular numbers. But I need to think about how to count that.

Alternatively, think of the formula as a combination. The number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 1 to n + 2 is equal to the sum of triangular numbers. How?

Let me think. Suppose we have three numbers a < b < c. Then, each such triplet can be associated with some position in the triangular numbers. Wait, maybe not directly. Alternatively, think of the triangular numbers as the number of ways to choose two numbers from 1 to k, and then summing over k. But this seems similar to the previous combinatorial argument.

Alternatively, think of the sum_{k=1}^n t_k = sum_{k=1}^n [sum_{i=1}^k i] = sum_{i=1}^n sum_{k=i}^n i} = sum_{i=1}^n i*(n - i + 1). Wait, that might be another way to approach it. Let me try that.

So, swapping the order of summation. The original sum is sum_{k=1}^n sum_{i=1}^k i. Which is equal to sum_{i=1}^n sum_{k=i}^n i. Because for each i, it's included in the inner sum for all k from i to n. Therefore, the inner sum is i*(n - i + 1). Therefore, the total sum is sum_{i=1}^n i(n - i + 1). Let me compute that.

Expanding the term: i(n - i + 1) = i(n + 1 - i) = i(n + 1) - i². Therefore, the sum becomes:

Sum_{i=1}^n [i(n + 1) - i²] = (n + 1) Sum_{i=1}^n i - Sum_{i=1}^n i²

Which is exactly the same as before. So that's the same expression as before. Which then gives us the same result. Therefore, this approach also leads to the formula.

So, regardless of the method—whether using standard summation formulas, induction, combinatorial arguments, or swapping the order of summation—we arrive at the same formula. Therefore, the formula is correct.

But since the problem says it's attributed to Aryabhata, maybe he used a different method? However, since I can't recall specific historical methods, but given that the formula is derived through standard mathematical techniques, which are still valid today, I think the derivation is correct.

Alternatively, maybe Aryabhata used a method of recursion or some geometric visualization. For example, he might have noticed that the sum of triangular numbers forms a tetrahedral shape and found a way to compute its volume or number of elements.

But regardless of the historical method, the derivation using algebraic manipulation is solid. Therefore, the formula is derived as shown.

Therefore, the answer is the formula n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6, which we derived through multiple methods.

**Final Answer**
The sum of the first $ n $ triangular numbers is \boxed{\dfrac{n(n + 1)(n + 2)}{6}}.
</think>

To derive the formula for the sum of the first $ n $ triangular numbers, we begin by recognizing that the $ k $-th triangular number is given by:

$$
t_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}
$$

The sum of the first $ n $ triangular numbers is then:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} t_k = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}
$$

We can factor out the $ \frac{1}{2} $ and expand the expression inside the summation:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{n} (k^2 + k) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} k \right)
$$

We now apply the known formulas for the sum of the first $ n $ natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first $ n $ natural numbers:

- $ \sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} $
- $ \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} $

Substituting these into the expression:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} t_k = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} + \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)
$$

To simplify, we find a common denominator for the terms inside the parentheses:

$$
\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} + \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} + \frac{3n(n + 1)}{6} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1 + 3)}{6} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 4)}{6}
$$

Factor out a 2 from the numerator:

$$
\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 4)}{6} = \frac{n(n + 1) \cdot 2(n + 2)}{6} = \frac{n(n + 1)(n + 2)}{3}
$$

Now multiply by $ \frac{1}{2} $:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} t_k = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{n(n + 1)(n + 2)}{3} = \frac{n(n + 1)(n + 2)}{6}
$$

---

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the first $ n $ triangular numbers is:

$$
\boxed{\dfrac{n(n + 1)(n + 2)}{6}}
$$
