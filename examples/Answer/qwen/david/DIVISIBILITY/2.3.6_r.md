Okay, so I need to verify these four statements for an arbitrary integer a. Let me take them one by one. Starting with part (a): 2 divides a(a + 1), and 3 divides a(a + 1)(a + 2). Hmm, okay. Let me think about divisibility here.

For the first part, 2 divides a(a + 1). Well, a and a + 1 are consecutive integers. In any two consecutive integers, one of them must be even. So, if a is even, then a is divisible by 2. If a is odd, then a + 1 is even. Therefore, in either case, the product a(a + 1) is divisible by 2. That makes sense. So that part is straightforward.

Now for the second part, 3 divides a(a + 1)(a + 2). These are three consecutive integers. In any three consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 3. Let me check that. Suppose a is divisible by 3, then the product is divisible by 3. If a is not divisible by 3, then either a + 1 or a + 2 must be. For example, if a ≡ 1 mod 3, then a + 2 ≡ 0 mod 3. If a ≡ 2 mod 3, then a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. So yes, in any case, one of the three numbers is divisible by 3. Therefore, the product is divisible by 3. So that seems right. So part (a) is done.

Moving on to part (b): 3 divides a(2a² + 7). Hmm. So I need to show that 3 divides this expression for any integer a. Let me think. Maybe I can consider modulo 3. Let me check the possible residues of a modulo 3. Since a can be congruent to 0, 1, or 2 mod 3.

Case 1: a ≡ 0 mod 3. Then the entire expression is 0*(something) which is 0 mod 3. So that's divisible by 3.

Case 2: a ≡ 1 mod 3. Let's compute 2a² + 7. First, a² ≡ 1² = 1 mod 3. So 2*1 + 7 = 2 + 7 = 9. 9 mod 3 is 0. Therefore, 2a² + 7 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, the entire expression is 1*0 = 0 mod 3. So divisible by 3.

Case 3: a ≡ 2 mod 3. Then a² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. So again, 2*1 + 7 = 9 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, the expression is 2*0 = 0 mod 3. So again, divisible by 3.

Therefore, regardless of a mod 3, the expression is divisible by 3. Therefore, 3 divides a(2a² + 7). So part (b) is done.

Now part (c): If a is odd, then 32 divides (a² + 3)(a² + 7). Hmm. Okay, so a is odd. Need to show that (a² + 3)(a² + 7) is divisible by 32. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe expand the product and see if I can find factors of 32?

Alternatively, since 32 is 2^5, maybe I can show that the product is divisible by 32 by considering the expression modulo 32. But since a is odd, maybe I can write a as 2k + 1 for some integer k. Let me try that.

Let me first compute a². If a is odd, then a = 2k + 1. Then a² = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k² + 4k + 1. Therefore, a² + 3 = 4k² + 4k + 1 + 3 = 4k² + 4k + 4 = 4(k² + k + 1). Similarly, a² + 7 = 4k² + 4k + 1 + 7 = 4k² + 4k + 8 = 4(k² + k + 2). Therefore, the product (a² + 3)(a² + 7) = [4(k² + k + 1)][4(k² + k + 2)] = 16(k² + k + 1)(k² + k + 2). So now, the product is 16 times (k² + k + 1)(k² + k + 2). Therefore, if I can show that (k² + k + 1)(k² + k + 2) is even, then the entire product would be 16 * even = 32 * something, hence divisible by 32.

But let's check if (k² + k + 1)(k² + k + 2) is even. Let me denote m = k² + k. Then the product becomes (m + 1)(m + 2). So, m + 1 and m + 2 are consecutive integers. Therefore, one of them is even. Therefore, their product is even. Therefore, (k² + k + 1)(k² + k + 2) is even, so the entire expression is 16 * even = 32 * integer. Therefore, 32 divides (a² + 3)(a² + 7). Therefore, that seems to work. Wait, but is that all? Let me check with some examples.

Take a = 1 (odd). Then (1 + 3)(1 + 7) = 4 * 8 = 32. 32 divides 32, yes. Take a = 3. Then a² + 3 = 9 + 3 = 12, a² + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16. 12 * 16 = 192. 192 / 32 = 6. So yes. Another example: a = 5. a² = 25. 25 + 3 = 28, 25 + 7 = 32. 28 * 32 = 896. 896 / 32 = 28. So yes. Another example: a = -1. Then a² = 1. 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 7 = 8. 4 * 8 = 32. Divisible by 32. Okay, seems like this works. But wait, let me check if my reasoning is correct. So I wrote a as 2k + 1, then found that (a² + 3)(a² + 7) is 16*(something even). Therefore, 16*2*m = 32*m. So that's 32 divides it. So that seems correct. But maybe there's a way to see it more directly?

Alternatively, since a is odd, then a is congruent to 1 or 3 mod 4? Wait, maybe not. Let me think about modulo 2^5 = 32. But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since a is odd, a² is 1 mod 8. Wait, let me check that. For any odd integer a, a is 1 or 3 or 5 or 7 mod 8. Then a² mod 8:

1² = 1, 3² = 9 ≡ 1, 5² = 25 ≡ 1, 7² = 49 ≡ 1 mod 8. Therefore, a² ≡ 1 mod 8. Therefore, a² + 3 ≡ 1 + 3 = 4 mod 8, and a² + 7 ≡ 1 + 7 = 8 ≡ 0 mod 8. Therefore, (a² + 3)(a² + 7) ≡ 4 * 0 = 0 mod 8. But we need to show divisibility by 32. So that's only 8. So maybe need to check higher powers.

Alternatively, since a is odd, let me write a = 2k + 1. Then, as before, a² = 4k² + 4k + 1. Then a² + 3 = 4k² + 4k + 4 = 4(k² + k + 1). Similarly, a² + 7 = 4k² + 4k + 8 = 4(k² + k + 2). Then, the product is 16*(k² + k + 1)(k² + k + 2). Now, let me analyze (k² + k + 1)(k² + k + 2). Let me set m = k² + k. Then, the product is (m + 1)(m + 2) = m² + 3m + 2. But maybe not helpful. Alternatively, since m = k² + k, which is k(k + 1). So m is the product of two consecutive integers, so it is even. Therefore, m is even, so m = 2n for some integer n. Therefore, (m + 1)(m + 2) = (2n + 1)(2n + 2) = (2n + 1)*2(n + 1). Therefore, this is 2*(2n + 1)*(n + 1). Therefore, the entire expression is 16 * 2*(...) = 32*(...). Therefore, that's 32 times something. Therefore, divisible by 32. Therefore, that's the same conclusion as before. So that works.

But wait, in this case, m = k(k + 1) is even, so m is even. Therefore, m + 1 and m + 2 are consecutive integers, so one of them is even. Wait, but in the previous step, I said that (m + 1)(m + 2) is 2*(...). But since m is even, then m + 1 is odd, m + 2 is even. Therefore, (m + 1)(m + 2) is even. Therefore, the product is 2*(something). Therefore, the entire expression is 16*2*(something) = 32*(something). Therefore, that's 32 divides it. So that's correct.

But maybe I can check if there is a higher power? For example, maybe the product is divisible by higher powers of 2? But the question only requires divisibility by 32, which is 2^5. So since we have 16*2 = 32, that's sufficient. Therefore, the answer is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me think. Since a is odd, then a ≡ 1 mod 2. Then, let me compute (a² + 3)(a² + 7). Let me compute modulo 32. But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, note that a² is 1 mod 8, as we saw. Therefore, a² + 3 is 4 mod 8, and a² + 7 is 0 mod 8. Therefore, the product is 4 * 0 = 0 mod 8. But we need mod 32. Let me check for a specific case. For example, take a = 1. Then (1 + 3)(1 + 7) = 4 * 8 = 32, which is 0 mod 32. For a = 3, (9 + 3)(9 + 7) = 12 * 16 = 192. 192 / 32 = 6. So 192 is 0 mod 32. For a = 5: 25 + 3 = 28, 25 + 7 = 32. 28 * 32 = 896. 896 / 32 = 28. So again 0 mod 32. For a = 7: 49 + 3 = 52, 49 + 7 = 56. 52 * 56 = 2912. 2912 / 32 = 91. So again 0 mod 32. So seems like it works. But why?

Alternatively, since a is odd, let me write a = 2k + 1. Then, a² = 4k² + 4k + 1. Then, a² + 3 = 4k² + 4k + 4 = 4(k² + k + 1). Similarly, a² + 7 = 4k² + 4k + 8 = 4(k² + k + 2). Therefore, the product is 16*(k² + k + 1)(k² + k + 2). Now, let me analyze (k² + k + 1)(k² + k + 2). Let me denote m = k² + k. Then, the product is (m + 1)(m + 2) = m² + 3m + 2. But m = k(k + 1). Therefore, m is even as k and k + 1 are consecutive integers, so one of them is even. Therefore, m is even. Therefore, m = 2n. Therefore, substituting back, we have (2n + 1)(2n + 2) = 2n(2n + 1) + 2(2n + 1) = 2n(2n + 1) + 2(2n + 1). Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, as before, (m + 1)(m + 2) = (even + 1)(even + 2) = (odd)(even). Therefore, the product is even. Therefore, the entire expression is 16 * even = 32 * integer. Therefore, divisible by 32. Therefore, that's the reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I can check if (k² + k + 1)(k² + k + 2) is divisible by 2. Which it is, as we saw. Therefore, 16 * 2 * something = 32 * something. Therefore, yes. Therefore, the conclusion is correct.

Therefore, part (c) is done.

So, summarizing:

(a) For 2 | a(a + 1): since a and a + 1 are consecutive integers, one is even. For 3 | a(a + 1)(a + 2): three consecutive integers, one divisible by 3.

(b) For 3 | a(2a² + 7): check modulo 3 for a ≡ 0, 1, 2 mod 3, and in each case, the expression is 0 mod 3.

(c) For a odd, (a² + 3)(a² + 7) is 16 * even, hence divisible by 32.

Therefore, all parts are verified.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{2} divides $a(a + 1)$ and \boxed{3} divides $a(a + 1)(a + 2)$.

(b) \boxed{3} divides $a(2a^2 + 7)$.

(c) \boxed{32} divides $(a^2 + 3)(a^2 + 7)$.

### **(a) $ 2 \mid a(a + 1) $ and $ 3 \mid a(a + 1)(a + 2) $**

- **For $ 2 \mid a(a + 1) $:**

  Since $ a $ and $ a + 1 $ are consecutive integers, one of them must be even. Therefore, the product $ a(a + 1) $ is always divisible by 2.

- **For $ 3 \mid a(a + 1)(a + 2) $:**

  Among any three consecutive integers, one must be divisible by 3. Hence, the product $ a(a + 1)(a + 2) $ is divisible by 3.

**Conclusion:**  
$$
\boxed{2} \text{ divides } a(a + 1) \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{3} \text{ divides } a(a + 1)(a + 2)
$$

### **(b) $ 3 \mid a(2a^2 + 7) $**

We analyze the expression modulo 3:

- If $ a \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $, then $ a(2a^2 + 7) \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $.
- If $ a \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $, then $ 2a^2 + 7 \equiv 2(1) + 7 = 9 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $.
- If $ a \equiv 2 \pmod{3} $, then $ 2a^2 + 7 \equiv 2(4) + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $.

In all cases, the expression is divisible by 3.

**Conclusion:**  
$$
\boxed{3} \text{ divides } a(2a^2 + 7)
$$

---

### **(c) If $ a $ is odd, then $ 32 \mid (a^2 + 3)(a^2 + 7) $**

Let $ a = 2k + 1 $, an odd integer. Then:

- $ a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 $
- $ a^2 + 3 = 4k^2 + 4k + 4 = 4(k^2 + k + 1) $
- $ a^2 + 7 = 4k^2 + 4k + 8 = 4(k^2 + k + 2) $

Thus, the product becomes:
$$
(a^2 + 3)(a^2 + 7) = 16(k^2 + k + 1)(k^2 + k + 2)
$$

Now, note that $ k^2 + k = k(k + 1) $, the product of two consecutive integers, so it is always even. Let $ m = k^2 + k $, then $ m $ is even.

Let $ m + 1 $ and $ m + 2 $ be consecutive integers. One of them is even, so their product is even.

Therefore:
$$
(k^2 + k + 1)(k^2 + k + 2) = (m + 1)(m + 2) = \text{even}
$$

So the full expression becomes:
$$
16 \times \text{even} = 32 \times \text{integer}
$$

Hence, $ 32 \mid (a^2 + 3)(a^2 + 7) $.

**Conclusion:**  
$$
\boxed{32} \text{ divides } (a^2 + 3)(a^2 + 7)
$$
