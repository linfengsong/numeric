Okay, so I need to show that for any integer a, the gcd of these pairs of expressions is 1. Let me start with part (a): gcd(2a + 1, 9a + 4) = 1. Hmm, how do I approach this? I remember that the greatest common divisor of two numbers also divides any linear combination of them. Maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm here. Let me recall: gcd(m, n) = gcd(n, m mod n). So let me apply that.

Let me denote m = 9a + 4 and n = 2a + 1. Then, I need to compute gcd(9a + 4, 2a + 1). Let me compute (9a + 4) divided by (2a + 1). Let me see, how many times does 2a + 1 go into 9a + 4? Well, 2a + 1 times 4 is 8a + 4. Subtract that from 9a + 4: (9a + 4) - 4*(2a + 1) = 9a + 4 - 8a - 4 = a. So the remainder is a. Therefore, gcd(9a + 4, 2a + 1) = gcd(2a + 1, a). 

Now, let me compute gcd(2a + 1, a). Again, using the Euclidean algorithm: gcd(2a + 1, a) = gcd(a, (2a + 1) mod a). Since (2a + 1) mod a is just 1, because 2a mod a is 0, so 2a + 1 mod a is 1. Therefore, gcd(a, 1). But the gcd of any number and 1 is 1. Therefore, gcd(2a + 1, 9a + 4) = 1. So that's part (a) done. 

Wait, let me check with an example. Let me pick a = 1. Then 2(1) + 1 = 3, 9(1) + 4 = 13. gcd(3,13) is 1. If a = 2: 2*2 +1 = 5, 9*2 +4 = 22. gcd(5,22) is 1. If a = 0: 1 and 4, gcd is 1. If a = -1: 2*(-1) +1 = -1, 9*(-1) +4 = -5. gcd(-1, -5) is 1. Seems to check out. Okay, so part (a) is done.

Moving on to part (b): gcd(5a + 2, 7a + 3) = 1. Again, using the Euclidean algorithm. Let me denote m = 7a + 3 and n = 5a + 2. Compute gcd(7a + 3, 5a + 2). Let me do the division: divide 7a + 3 by 5a + 2. How many times does 5a + 2 go into 7a + 3? Once, because 5a + 2 times 1 is 5a + 2. Subtract that from 7a + 3: (7a + 3) - (5a + 2) = 2a + 1. Therefore, gcd(7a + 3, 5a + 2) = gcd(5a + 2, 2a + 1).

Now, repeat the process. Compute gcd(5a + 2, 2a + 1). Divide 5a + 2 by 2a + 1. How many times does 2a + 1 go into 5a + 2? Twice, since 2*(2a + 1) = 4a + 2. Subtract that from 5a + 2: (5a + 2) - 2*(2a + 1) = 5a + 2 - 4a - 2 = a. Therefore, gcd(5a + 2, 2a + 1) = gcd(2a + 1, a). 

Again, same as part (a). Now compute gcd(2a + 1, a). As before, (2a + 1) mod a is 1, so gcd(a, 1) = 1. Therefore, gcd(5a + 2, 7a + 3) = 1. Let me check with examples. Take a = 1: 5 + 2 = 7, 7 + 3 = 10. gcd(7,10)=1. a=2: 12 and 17, gcd 1. a=0: 2 and 3, gcd 1. a=-1: 5*(-1)+2=-3, 7*(-1)+3=-4. gcd(3,4)=1. Seems okay. So part (b) is done.

Now part (c): If a is odd, then gcd(3a, 3a + 2) = 1. Hmm. So here, a is odd. Let me think. Let me denote m = 3a and n = 3a + 2. So we need to show that gcd(m, n) = 1. Since n - m = 2, so the difference between them is 2. Therefore, any common divisor of m and n must divide 2. Therefore, the gcd is either 1 or 2. But since a is odd, let's see. If a is odd, then 3a is odd*3, which is odd. Then 3a + 2 is odd + even = odd + even = odd? Wait, 3a is odd, adding 2 (even) gives odd + even = odd? Wait, no. Wait, odd + even is odd. Wait, 3a is odd, so 3a + 2 is odd + even = odd? Wait, no. Wait, 3a is odd. Let me think. For example, if a is odd, say a = 1: 3*1 = 3, which is odd. 3 + 2 = 5, which is odd. If a = 3: 9 + 2 = 11, odd. So both numbers are odd. Therefore, their gcd must be odd. But the difference is 2, so the gcd divides 2. But since the gcd is odd, it must divide 1. Therefore, gcd is 1. Therefore, the conclusion is 1. 

Alternatively, let me use the Euclidean algorithm. Let me compute gcd(3a, 3a + 2). Then, gcd(3a, 3a + 2) = gcd(3a, (3a + 2) - 3a) = gcd(3a, 2). Since a is odd, 3a is odd. Therefore, gcd(odd, 2) is 1, since 2 divides only even numbers. Therefore, gcd(3a, 2) = 1. Therefore, gcd(3a, 3a + 2) = 1. 

Alternatively, suppose that d divides both 3a and 3a + 2. Then d divides their difference, which is 2. Therefore, d divides 2. Also, since d divides 3a, and a is odd, 3a is odd. Therefore, d must be odd. Therefore, the only common divisor is 1. Therefore, gcd is 1. 

So that's part (c). Let me check with examples. Let a be odd, say 1: gcd(3,5)=1. a=3: gcd(9, 11)=1. a=5: 15 and 17, gcd 1. a=-1: gcd(-3, -1)=1. So yes, that works. 

Wait, but what if a is odd but 3a and 3a + 2 share a common factor? Suppose d divides both. Then d divides 2 and 3a. Since d divides 2, possible d is 1 or 2. But since 3a is odd, d cannot be 2. Therefore, d must be 1. So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, all three parts are done. 

But let me check part (c) again. Suppose a is odd. Let me suppose that there is a prime p dividing both 3a and 3a + 2. Then p divides (3a + 2) - 3a = 2. So p divides 2. Therefore, p is 2. But since a is odd, 3a is odd, so 2 does not divide 3a. Therefore, no such prime p exists. Therefore, gcd is 1. 

Yes, that's another way to see it. So all parts are correct.

To solve the given problems, we will use the **Euclidean algorithm** and properties of the **greatest common divisor (gcd)**. The key idea is that the gcd of two numbers also divides their linear combinations. This allows us to reduce the problem to a simpler form.

### **(a) Show that $ \gcd(2a + 1, 9a + 4) = 1 $**

We apply the Euclidean algorithm:

$$
\gcd(2a + 1, 9a + 4) = \gcd(2a + 1, 9a + 4 - 4 \cdot (2a + 1)) = \gcd(2a + 1, a)
$$

Now compute:

$$
\gcd(2a + 1, a) = \gcd(a, (2a + 1) - 2a) = \gcd(a, 1) = 1
$$

Thus, the gcd is 1 for any integer $ a $.

$$
\boxed{1}
$$

---

### **(b) Show that $ \gcd(5a + 2, 7a + 3) = 1 $**

Again, using the Euclidean algorithm:

$$
\gcd(5a + 2, 7a + 3) = \gcd(5a + 2, 7a + 3 - 1 \cdot (5a + 2)) = \gcd(5a + 2, 2a + 1)
$$

Now:

$$
\gcd(5a + 2, 2a + 1) = \gcd(2a + 1, 5a + 2 - 2 \cdot (2a + 1)) = \gcd(2a + 1, a)
$$

Then:

$$
\gcd(2a + 1, a) = \gcd(a, (2a + 1) - 2a) = \gcd(a, 1) = 1
$$

So, the gcd is 1 for any integer $ a $.

$$
\boxed{1}
$$

---

### **(c) If $ a $ is odd, then $ \gcd(3a, 3a + 2) = 1 $**

Let $ d = \gcd(3a, 3a + 2) $. Then $ d $ divides both $ 3a $ and $ 3a + 2 $, so it divides their difference:

$$
d \mid (3a + 2) - 3a = 2
$$

So $ d $ must be either 1 or 2.

Now, since $ a $ is odd, $ 3a $ is odd. Thus, $ d \mid 2 $, but $ d $ cannot be 2 because 2 does not divide an odd number. Hence, $ d = 1 $.

Alternatively, using the Euclidean algorithm:

$$
\gcd(3a, 3a + 2) = \gcd(3a, 2)
$$

Since $ a $ is odd, $ 3a $ is odd, and 2 is even, so $ \gcd(3a, 2) = 1 $.

$$
\boxed{1}
$$
