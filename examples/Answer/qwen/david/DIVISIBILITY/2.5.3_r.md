Okay, so I need to solve these four Diophantine equations in positive integers. Let me start with part (a): 18x + 5y = 48. Hmm, Diophantine equations are equations where we look for integer solutions, right? And since they specify positive integers, x and y have to be positive integers. 

First, I remember that for a linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c, there are solutions if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b divides c. So maybe I should check if gcd(18, 5) divides 48. Let me compute gcd(18,5). Well, 18 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 3. Then gcd(5,3). 5 divided by 3 is 1 with remainder 2. Then gcd(3,2). 3 divided by 2 is 1 with remainder 1. Then gcd(2,1). Which is 1. So gcd(18,5) is 1. And 1 divides 48, so there are solutions. Good.

But since we need positive integers, I need to find all pairs (x, y) where x and y are positive integers satisfying 18x + 5y = 48. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let me try solving for y. So 5y = 48 - 18x. Therefore, y = (48 - 18x)/5. Since y has to be a positive integer, (48 - 18x) must be divisible by 5 and result in a positive number. 

So 48 - 18x must be divisible by 5. Let me write that as 48 ≡ 18x mod 5. Let me compute 48 mod 5. 5*9=45, so 48-45=3, so 48 ≡ 3 mod 5. Similarly, 18 mod 5 is 3, since 5*3=15, 18-15=3. Therefore, 3 ≡ 3x mod 5. So 3x ≡ 3 mod 5. Dividing both sides by 3 (since 3 and 5 are coprime, we can do that). So x ≡ 1 mod 5. Therefore, x can be written as x = 5k + 1, where k is an integer. 

But since x must be positive, let's find the possible values of k. Also, since y must be positive, let's substitute x into the equation and find constraints on k. 

So x = 5k + 1. Then substituting into y:

y = (48 - 18*(5k + 1))/5 = (48 - 90k - 18)/5 = (30 - 90k)/5 = 6 - 18k.

So y = 6 - 18k. Since y must be positive, 6 - 18k > 0 => 6 > 18k => k < 6/18 => k < 1/3. Since k is an integer, k must be less than 1/3. Therefore, k can be 0 or negative integers? Wait, but x has to be positive. Let's check x = 5k + 1. If k is 0, then x = 1. If k is negative, say k = -1, then x = 5*(-1) +1 = -4, which is negative. So x must be positive, so k must be such that 5k + 1 > 0. So 5k +1 > 0 => k > -1/5. Since k is integer, k ≥ 0. Therefore, k can only be 0. Wait, but if k is 0, then y = 6 - 18*0 = 6. So that gives x=1, y=6. 

But wait, is that the only solution? Let me check. Let me try plugging in x=1: 18*1 + 5*6 = 18 + 30 = 48. Correct. What if k is negative? For example, k=-1 gives x=-4, which is invalid. So only k=0? But maybe there are other solutions? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check if there are other solutions. 

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this by finding one particular solution and then finding the general solution. Let me try that. 

We have 18x + 5y = 48. Let me find one particular solution. Let me try x=1, then 18 + 5y =48 => 5y=30 => y=6. So (1,6) is a solution. 

The general solution can be found by knowing that the homogeneous equation is 18x + 5y = 0. The solutions to this are multiples of the coefficients. Since gcd(18,5)=1, the solutions to the homogeneous equation are x = 5t, y = -18t for integer t. Therefore, the general solution to the original equation is x = 1 + 5t, y = 6 - 18t. 

So we need x > 0 and y > 0. Therefore:

1 + 5t > 0 => t > -1/5. Since t is integer, t ≥ 0.

6 - 18t > 0 => 18t < 6 => t < 6/18 => t < 1/3. Since t is integer, t ≤ 0.

Therefore, combining both inequalities, t must be 0. Therefore, only solution is t=0, which gives x=1, y=6. 

So that's the only solution. Therefore, part (a) has only one solution: (1,6). 

Wait, but maybe I should check if there are other solutions. Let me try x=6: 18*6=108, which is already bigger than 48. So no. What about x=0? But x must be positive. Similarly, y=0? Not allowed. So yes, only (1,6). So part (a) is done.

Moving on to part (b): 54x + 21y = 906. Again, looking for positive integers x and y. Let me check if there are solutions. First, check gcd(54,21). Let me compute gcd(54,21). 54 divided by 21 is 2 with remainder 12. Then gcd(21,12). 21 divided by 12 is 1 with remainder 9. Then gcd(12,9). 12 divided by 9 is 1 with remainder 3. Then gcd(9,3) is 3. Therefore, gcd(54,21)=3. Now check if 3 divides 906. 906 divided by 3 is 302. Yes, so there are solutions.

Now, to find all positive integer solutions. Let me first find one particular solution. Maybe I can simplify the equation by dividing by 3. Let me do that: 54x +21y = 906. Divide both sides by 3: 18x +7y = 302. So now, the equation is 18x +7y = 302. Now, solving this equation for positive integers x and y.

Alternatively, maybe I can work with the original equation. But let me try the simplified version. Let me try to find one particular solution. Let me solve for y: 7y = 302 -18x => y = (302 -18x)/7. Need this to be integer and positive. So 302 -18x must be divisible by 7. Let me compute 302 mod 7. Let me divide 302 by 7. 7*43=301, so 302=7*43 +1, so 302 ≡1 mod7. Similarly, 18 mod7 is 4, since 14 is 2*7, 18-14=4. Therefore, 18x ≡4x mod7. Therefore, 302 -18x ≡1 -4x ≡0 mod7. Therefore, 1 -4x ≡0 mod7 => 4x ≡1 mod7. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod7. Since 4*2=8≡1 mod7, so inverse of 4 is 2. Therefore, x ≡2*1 ≡2 mod7. Therefore, x=7k +2 for some integer k. 

So x=7k +2. Then substitute back into y=(302 -18x)/7. Let me compute that:

y=(302 -18*(7k +2))/7 = (302 -126k -36)/7 = (266 -126k)/7 = 38 - 18k.

Therefore, y=38 -18k. Now, since x and y must be positive integers, we need:

x=7k +2 >0 => 7k +2 >0 => k ≥0 (since if k=-1, x=7*(-1)+2=-5 <0, invalid). 

And y=38 -18k >0 => 38 -18k >0 => 18k <38 => k <38/18 ≈2.111... So k ≤2. Therefore, k can be 0,1,2. Let me check each:

For k=0: x=2, y=38. Check 18*2 +7*38 = 36 + 266=302. Correct.

For k=1: x=7+2=9, y=38 -18=20. Check 18*9 +7*20= 162 +140=302. Correct.

For k=2: x=7*2 +2=16, y=38 -18*2=38-36=2. Check 18*16 +7*2= 288 +14=302. Correct.

For k=3: y=38 -54= -16 <0, invalid. So only k=0,1,2. Therefore, three solutions: (2,38), (9,20), (16,2). 

But wait, the original equation was 54x +21y=906. Let me check if these solutions satisfy that. For example, first solution: 54*2 +21*38. 54*2=108, 21*38=798. 108+798=906. Correct. Similarly, 54*9=486, 21*20=420. 486+420=906. Correct. 54*16=864, 21*2=42. 864+42=906. Correct. So yes, these are all valid. Therefore, part (b) has three solutions.

But wait, the problem says "determine all solutions in the positive integers". So the answer is those three pairs. Therefore, part (b) is done.

Moving on to part (c): 123x + 360y = 99. Again, looking for positive integers x and y. Let me check if there are solutions. First, compute gcd(123,360). Let me compute gcd(123,360). 

Divide 360 by 123: 123*2=246, 360-246=114. Now gcd(123,114). Then 123-114=9. Then gcd(114,9). 114 divided by 9 is 12 with remainder 6. Then gcd(9,6). Then gcd(6,3). Then gcd(3,0). So gcd is 3. Therefore, gcd(123,360)=3. Now check if 3 divides 99. Yes, 99/3=33. Therefore, there are solutions. 

But since we need positive integers, let me find solutions. Let me first simplify the equation by dividing by 3: 123x + 360y = 99 => divide by 3: 41x + 120y = 33. 

So now the equation is 41x + 120y = 33. Let me try to find solutions here. 

First, check if there are solutions. Since gcd(41,120)=1 (since 41 is prime and doesn't divide 120). So yes, solutions exist. Let me find one particular solution. Let me solve for x or y. Let me try solving for x: 41x = 33 - 120y => x=(33 - 120y)/41. Need this to be integer and positive. Alternatively, solving for y: 120y = 33 -41x => y=(33 -41x)/120. 

Alternatively, maybe use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a particular solution. Let me try that. 

First, find integers a and b such that 41a + 120b = 1. Then multiply by 33 to get the solution. 

So let me compute gcd(41,120). 

Using the Euclidean algorithm:

120 = 2*41 + 38

41 = 1*38 + 3

38 = 12*3 + 2

3 = 1*2 + 1

2 = 2*1 + 0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1 = 3 - 1*2

But 2 = 38 - 12*3, so substitute:

1 = 3 - 1*(38 - 12*3) = 13*3 - 1*38

But 3 = 41 - 1*38, substitute:

1 = 13*(41 - 1*38) -1*38 = 13*41 -14*38

But 38 = 120 - 2*41, substitute:

1 = 13*41 -14*(120 - 2*41) = 13*41 -14*120 +28*41 = 41*41 -14*120

Therefore, 41*41 -14*120 = 1. Therefore, a particular solution to 41a + 120b =1 is a=41, b=-14. Therefore, multiplying by 33, we get a particular solution to 41x + 120y =33: x=41*33, y=-14*33. Let me compute that:

x=41*33. Let me compute 40*33=1320, plus 1*33=33, so 1353. 

y=-14*33= -462. 

So one particular solution is (1353, -462). But we need positive integers. So we need to find all solutions. 

The general solution of the equation 41x + 120y =33 is given by:

x = x0 + 120t

y = y0 - 41t

where t is integer. 

So substituting x0=1353, y0=-462:

x = 1353 + 120t

y = -462 -41t

We need x >0 and y>0. So:

1353 + 120t >0 => 120t > -1353 => t > -1353/120 ≈ -11.275. Since t is integer, t ≥ -11.

And y = -462 -41t >0 => -41t > 462 => t < -462/41 ≈ -11.268. So t < -11.268. Since t is integer, t ≤ -12.

But from the first inequality, t ≥ -11. So combining t ≥ -11 and t ≤ -12 is impossible. Therefore, there are no solutions? Wait, that can't be. But the original equation was 123x + 360y =99. Which simplifies to 41x + 120y =33. But if there are no solutions, then there are no positive integer solutions. However, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the extended Euclidean algorithm. Let me check again. 

Earlier steps:

We had:

1 = 13*41 -14*120. Therefore, 41*13 -120*14 =1. Therefore, 41*13 + 120*(-14) =1. Therefore, the particular solution is x=13, y=-14. Then multiplying by 33 gives x=13*33=429, y=-14*33=-462. Wait, earlier I had 41*33, but that was wrong. The correct particular solution is x=13*33=429, y=-14*33=-462. So that was my mistake earlier. I had written 41*33 instead of 13*33. So that was wrong. So the correct particular solution is (429, -462). 

So general solution is x=429 + 120t, y=-462 -41t. Now, need x>0 and y>0. So:

x=429 + 120t >0 => 120t > -429 => t > -429/120 ≈ -3.575. Therefore, t ≥ -3.

y=-462 -41t >0 => -41t > 462 => t < -462/41 ≈ -11.268. Therefore, t ≤ -12.

But t must satisfy t ≥ -3 and t ≤ -12? That's impossible. Therefore, no solutions? But that seems strange. However, maybe there is a mistake in the process. Alternatively, maybe there are no positive integer solutions. Let me check with another approach. 

Alternatively, maybe I can try solving 41x + 120y =33 for positive integers. Let me try small values of x or y. Let me try x=1: 41 + 120y =33 => 120y = -8, no. x=2: 82 + 120y=33 => 120y=-49, nope. Similarly, x=3: 123 + 120y=33 => 120y= -90, nope. Similarly, negative. If I try y=1: 41x + 120 =33 => 41x = -87, nope. y=0: 41x=33, nope. y=-1: 41x + 120*(-1)=33 => 41x=57, nope. So seems like no solutions. Therefore, maybe there are no positive integer solutions. 

But the original equation was 123x + 360y =99. Which is equivalent to 41x + 120y =33. So no solutions in positive integers. Therefore, part (c) has no solutions. 

But wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the extended Euclidean algorithm. Let me check again. 

Earlier, I had:

1 = 13*41 -14*120. Let me verify this. 13*41 is 533, 14*120 is 1680. 533 - 1680 = -1147. Wait, that's not 1. Wait, that can't be. There must be a mistake here. Wait, earlier steps:

Let me redo the extended Euclidean algorithm for 41 and 120.

We have:

120 = 2*41 + 38

41 = 1*38 + 3

38 = 12*3 + 2

3 = 1*2 + 1

2 = 2*1 + 0

So backtracking:

1 = 3 - 1*2

But 2 = 38 - 12*3, so substitute:

1 = 3 - 1*(38 - 12*3) = 13*3 - 1*38

But 3 = 41 - 1*38, substitute:

1 = 13*(41 - 1*38) - 1*38 = 13*41 -14*38

But 38 = 120 - 2*41, substitute:

1 = 13*41 -14*(120 - 2*41) = 13*41 -14*120 + 28*41 = 41*(13 + 28) -14*120 = 41*41 -14*120. 

Wait, 13 + 28 is 41? 13 + 28 is 41? 13 +28=41? 13+28=41? Wait, 13+28 is 41? No, 13+28=41? 13+28=41? 13+28=41? 13+28=41? Wait, 13+28 is 41? 13+28=41? 13+28 is 41? Wait, 13+28 is 41? 13+28=41? 13+28=41? Wait 13+28 is 41? 13+28 is 41? Wait, 13 + 28 is 41? Let me compute 13 + 28: 10+20=30, 3+8=11, total 41. Yes. So 13 + 28 is 41. Therefore, 1 = 41*41 -14*120. Therefore, 41*41 -14*120 =1. Therefore, 41*41 -14*120 =1. Therefore, 41*41 = 1 +14*120. Therefore, 41*41 = 1 + 1680 = 1681. Which is indeed 41^2=1681. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the equation is correct. Therefore, the particular solution is (41, -14). Therefore, multiplying by 33 gives (41*33, -14*33). Which is 1353, -462. Wait, but earlier I thought that was wrong. Wait, but in the backtracking, we had 1 = 41*41 -14*120. Therefore, 1 = 41*41 -14*120. Therefore, if we want 41x + 120y = 33, then multiply both sides by 33: 41*(41*33) + 120*(-14*33) = 33. Therefore, x=41*33, y=-14*33. Which is 1353 and -462. But that seems like a very large x. But maybe that's correct. However, when we tried to find solutions, we saw that even with x=1, there's no solution. So maybe there are no solutions. Therefore, part (c) has no solutions. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the process. Let me check if there's another way. Let me try solving 41x + 120y =33. Let me try solving for x in terms of y. 41x = 33 -120y. Therefore, 33 -120y must be divisible by 41 and positive. Let me compute 33 mod41 is 33. 120 mod41: 41*2=82, 120-82=38. So 120 ≡38 mod41. Therefore, 33 - 38y ≡0 mod41 => -38y ≡ -33 mod41 => 38y ≡33 mod41. Let me solve for y. 

Find y such that 38y ≡33 mod41. Since gcd(38,41)=1 (because 41 is prime and 38 <41). Therefore, inverse of 38 mod41. Let me find the inverse. 

Find an integer k such that 38k ≡1 mod41. Let me try using extended Euclidean algorithm again. 

Find gcd(38,41):

41 = 1*38 + 3

38 = 12*3 + 2

3 = 1*2 + 1

2 = 2*1 +0. So gcd is 1. Backwards:

1 = 3 - 1*2

But 2 = 38 - 12*3, so substitute:

1 = 3 - 1*(38 -12*3) = 13*3 -1*38

But 3 = 41 -1*38, substitute:

1 = 13*(41 -1*38) -1*38 =13*41 -14*38

Therefore, -14*38 ≡1 mod41. Therefore, inverse of 38 mod41 is -14. Which is equivalent to 41 -14=27. Therefore, inverse is 27. 

Therefore, y ≡33 *27 mod41. Let me compute 33*27. 30*27=810, 3*27=81, total 810+81=891. Now divide 891 by 41. Let me compute 41*21=861, 891-861=30. Therefore, 891 ≡30 mod41. Therefore, y ≡30 mod41. Therefore, y=41m +30 for some integer m. 

Therefore, substitute back into the equation: 41x +120*(41m +30)=33 => 41x + 120*41m + 3600=33 => 41x = 33 - 3600 - 120*41m => 41x = -3567 - 4920m => x= (-3567 -4920m)/41. Let me compute -3567 /41. Let me divide 3567 by 41. 41*80=3280. 3567-3280=287. 41*7=287. Therefore, 41*87=3567. Therefore, -3567 /41= -87. Therefore, x= -87 - (4920/41)m. Compute 4920 /41: 41*120=4920. Therefore, x= -87 -120m. 

Therefore, x= -87 -120m. Since x must be positive, -87 -120m >0 => -120m >87 => m < -87/120 ≈ -0.725. Therefore, m ≤ -1. Also, y=41m +30 must be positive. So 41m +30 >0 => 41m > -30 => m > -30/41 ≈ -0.7317. Therefore, m > -0.7317. Since m is integer, m ≥0. But earlier, m ≤-1. Therefore, no solution. Therefore, no solutions. Therefore, part (c) has no solutions. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no positive integer solutions for part (c). 

Moving on to part (d): 158x - 57y = 7. Again, looking for positive integers x and y. Let me check if there are solutions. First, compute gcd(158,57). Let me compute gcd(158,57). 

Divide 158 by 57: 57*2=114, 158-114=44. Now gcd(57,44). 

57 divided by 44 is 1 with remainder 13. Then gcd(44,13). 

44 divided by 13 is 3 with remainder 5. Then gcd(13,5). 

13 divided by 5 is 2 with remainder 3. Then gcd(5,3). 

5 divided by 3 is 1 with remainder 2. Then gcd(3,2). 

3 divided by 2 is 1 with remainder 1. Then gcd(2,1)=1. Therefore, gcd(158,57)=1. Since 1 divides 7, there are solutions. 

Now, need to find positive integers x and y. Let me try to find one particular solution. Let me try solving for x or y. Let me try solving for x: 158x = 7 +57y => x=(7 +57y)/158. Need this to be integer and positive. Alternatively, solving for y: -57y =7 -158x => y=(158x -7)/57. Need this to be integer and positive. 

Alternatively, use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a particular solution. Let me try that. 

Find integers a and b such that 158a -57b =1. Which is equivalent to 158a + (-57)b =1. 

Let me compute gcd(158,57). As before, the gcd is 1. Let me perform the extended Euclidean algorithm. 

So:

158 = 2*57 + 44

57 = 1*44 + 13

44 = 3*13 + 5

13 = 2*5 + 3

5 = 1*3 + 2

3 = 1*2 + 1

2 = 2*1 + 0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1 = 3 - 1*2

But 2 = 5 -1*3, so substitute:

1 = 3 -1*(5 -1*3) = 2*3 -1*5

But 3 =13 -2*5, substitute:

1 = 2*(13 -2*5) -1*5 = 2*13 -5*5

But 5 =44 -3*13, substitute:

1 = 2*13 -5*(44 -3*13) = 2*13 -5*44 +15*13 = 17*13 -5*44

But 13 =57 -1*44, substitute:

1 = 17*(57 -1*44) -5*44 =17*57 -17*44 -5*44 =17*57 -22*44

But 44 =158 -2*57, substitute:

1 =17*57 -22*(158 -2*57) =17*57 -22*158 +44*57 = (17+44)*57 -22*158 =61*57 -22*158

Therefore, 61*57 -22*158 =1. Therefore, rearranged: -22*158 +61*57 =1. Therefore, a particular solution to 158a -57b =1 is a=-22, b=-61. Wait, no. Let me check:

The equation is 158a -57b =1. From above, we have -22*158 +61*57 =1. Therefore, rearranged: 158*(-22) +57*(61) =1. Therefore, if we write it as 158a -57b =1, then a=-22, and -57b = 57*61 => b=-61. Therefore, a=-22, b=-61. Therefore, a particular solution is (a,b)=(-22, -61). 

Therefore, multiplying by 7, we get a particular solution to 158x -57y=7: x=-22*7=-154, y=-61*7=-427. 

But we need positive solutions. The general solution for the equation 158x -57y =7 is given by:

x = x0 + 57t

y = y0 + 158t

Wait, because the homogeneous equation is 158x -57y =0, which has solutions x=57t, y=158t. Therefore, the general solution is x = x0 + 57t, y = y0 + 158t. Wait, but in our case, the equation is 158x -57y =7. Therefore, the general solution is x = x0 + 57t, y = y0 + 158t. Wait, let me check.

Suppose we have a particular solution (x0, y0). Then the general solution is x = x0 + (57)t, y = y0 + (158)t. Because the homogeneous equation is 158*(57t) -57*(158t) = 0. Therefore, yes. 

Therefore, with particular solution x0=-154, y0=-427. Therefore, general solution:

x = -154 +57t

y = -427 +158t

Now, need x >0 and y>0. So:

-154 +57t >0 => 57t >154 => t > 154/57 ≈2.701. Therefore, t ≥3.

And y=-427 +158t >0 => 158t >427 => t >427/158 ≈2.702. Therefore, t ≥3. 

Therefore, t must be ≥3. Let me check t=3:

x=-154 +57*3 = -154 +171=17

y=-427 +158*3= -427 +474=47. 

Check if 158*17 -57*47 = ?

Calculate 158*17: 150*17=2550, 8*17=136, total 2550+136=2686.

57*47: 50*47=2350, 7*47=329, total 2350+329=2679.

2686 -2679=7. Correct. 

So (17,47) is a solution. 

Now check t=4:

x=-154 +57*4= -154 +228=74

y=-427 +158*4= -427 +632=205. Check 158*74 -57*205. Let me compute 158*74. Well, 158*70=11060, 158*4=632, total 11060+632=11692. 57*205: 57*200=11400, 57*5=285, total 11400+285=11685. 11692 -11685=7. Correct. 

Similarly, t=5: x=-154 +57*5= -154 +285=131, y=-427 +158*5= -427 +790=363. Check 158*131 -57*363. Well, 158*131 is a big number, but since we know the general solution, it should work. 

But the question is to find all positive integer solutions. Since t can be any integer ≥3, there are infinitely many solutions. However, the problem says "determine all solutions in the positive integers". So maybe we need to express them in terms of t or find all solutions? Wait, but in Diophantine equations, usually, you can describe the solutions with parameters. However, since the problem says "determine all solutions", maybe they expect all solutions expressed in terms of parameters, or perhaps there's a specific number? But given that the equation is 158x -57y=7, and the coefficients are positive, but since x and y are positive integers, there are infinitely many solutions. However, maybe the problem expects to write the general solution or find all solutions with positive integers? Wait, but in the previous parts, for example part (a) had one solution, part (b) had three solutions, part (c) had none. For part (d), since t can be any integer ≥3, there are infinitely many solutions. But maybe the problem expects to write the general solution? Or maybe there are specific solutions? Wait, the problem says "determine all solutions in the positive integers". So maybe we need to describe them. However, maybe there's a restriction? Wait, but the equation is 158x -57y=7. Since x and y are positive integers, and coefficients are positive, but since it's 158x -57y=7, so y is (158x -7)/57. So for y to be positive, 158x -7 must be positive, so x ≥1. But also, since y must be integer, so 158x ≡7 mod57. Let me check that. 

Alternatively, maybe I can find all solutions by expressing them in terms of t. So the solutions are x= -154 +57t, y=-427 +158t, where t is integer ≥3. Therefore, all positive integer solutions are given by t ≥3. Therefore, the solutions are (x,y)= (57t -154, 158t -427) for integers t ≥3. 

But maybe we can write it in another way. Let me check if there are more constraints. For example, when t=3, x=17, y=47. For t=4, x=74, y=205. For t=5, x=131, y=363. Etc. Each time, increasing t by 1, x increases by 57, y increases by 158. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions. However, the problem says "determine all solutions in the positive integers". Depending on the context, maybe they want the general solution or specific solutions? But since the problem is in the style of Olympiad problems, maybe they expect to express the solutions in terms of a parameter. However, in some cases, maybe there are only specific solutions? Wait, but since t can be any integer ≥3, there are infinitely many. However, maybe the problem expects to write the general solution. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here? Let me check for t=3, x=17, y=47. For t=3, x=17, y=47. Then for t=3 +k, x=17 +57k, y=47 +158k. Therefore, all solutions are given by x=17 +57k, y=47 +158k where k is a non-negative integer. 

But let me check for k=0: x=17, y=47. For k=1: x=17+57=74, y=47+158=205. Correct. So yes, the general solution can be written as x=17 +57k, y=47 +158k where k is a non-negative integer. 

Therefore, the solutions are all pairs (17 +57k, 47 +158k) where k is a non-negative integer. 

But maybe the problem expects to write them in terms of t or something else. However, since the question says "determine all solutions", and there are infinitely many, but in the previous parts, they had specific numbers. However, in the case of part (d), since the equation is 158x -57y=7, which is a linear Diophantine equation with positive coefficients, but the equation is of the form ax - by = c, so x and y are positive integers. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions. However, the problem might expect to write the general solution. 

But in the problem statement, maybe they expect to write all solutions. However, since the user hasn't specified a particular format, but in the previous parts, they had specific solutions, but for part (d), since there are infinitely many, we need to describe them. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the general solution. Let me check. 

The general solution for 158x -57y =7 is x = x0 + 57t, y = y0 + 158t, where t is integer. Since the homogeneous solutions are multiples of (57, 158). Therefore, yes. 

But since we found that t ≥3, then the solutions are x= -154 +57t, y=-427 +158t, with t ≥3. Which can be rewritten as x=57(t - 3) +17, y=158(t -3) +47, where t ≥3. So if we let k = t -3, then k ≥0, and solutions are x=57k +17, y=158k +47, where k is a non-negative integer. Therefore, all positive integer solutions are given by this formula. 

Therefore, the answer is all pairs (x, y) where x=17 +57k and y=47 +158k for non-negative integers k.
