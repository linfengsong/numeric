Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the reciprocals of the first n triangular numbers is less than 2. The triangular numbers are given by the formula t_k = k(k+1)/2, right? So the sum we're looking at is 1/t_1 + 1/t_2 + ... + 1/t_n, and we need to show that this sum is always less than 2 for any positive integer n.

First, let me recall what triangular numbers are. The first few triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, etc. Each term is the sum of the natural numbers up to that point. So t_1 = 1, t_2 = 1+2=3, t_3=1+2+3=6, and so on. The general formula is t_k = k(k+1)/2. Therefore, the reciprocal of t_k is 2/(k(k+1)).

So the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n 1/t_k = sum_{k=1}^n 2/(k(k+1)). Therefore, S_n = 2 * sum_{k=1}^n [1/k - 1/(k+1)]. Wait, that seems like a telescoping series. Let me check that.

Because 1/(k(k+1)) can be expressed as 1/k - 1/(k+1). Let me verify that:

1/k - 1/(k+1) = (k+1 - k)/[k(k+1)] = 1/[k(k+1)]. Yes, that's correct. So that means each term in the sum is 2*(1/k - 1/(k+1)). Therefore, the entire sum S_n is 2 times the sum from k=1 to n of (1/k - 1/(k+1)).

Now, let's compute that sum. The sum of (1/k - 1/(k+1)) from k=1 to n is a telescoping series. Let's write out the terms:

For k=1: 1/1 - 1/2

k=2: 1/2 - 1/3

k=3: 1/3 - 1/4

...

k=n: 1/n - 1/(n+1)

Adding all these up, most terms cancel out. The -1/2 cancels with the +1/2, the -1/3 cancels with the +1/3, and so on, up to the -1/n cancels with the +1/n. So what's left is the first term of the first expression, which is 1/1, and the last term of the last expression, which is -1/(n+1). Therefore, the sum from k=1 to n of (1/k - 1/(k+1)) is 1 - 1/(n+1).

Therefore, S_n = 2*(1 - 1/(n+1)) = 2*( (n+1 - 1)/(n+1) ) = 2*(n/(n+1)) = 2n/(n+1).

So the sum S_n is equal to 2n/(n+1). Therefore, we need to show that 2n/(n+1) < 2 for all positive integers n.

Let me check this inequality. Let's compute 2n/(n+1) < 2.

Multiply both sides by (n+1), which is positive for all n ≥ 1. So inequality remains the same:

2n < 2(n + 1)

Simplify the right side: 2n + 2

So 2n < 2n + 2. Subtract 2n from both sides: 0 < 2. Which is true. Therefore, the inequality 2n/(n+1) < 2 holds for all n ≥ 1.

Therefore, the sum S_n is equal to 2n/(n+1), which is always less than 2. Therefore, the original statement is proven.

Wait, but let me check with some examples. Let's take n=1: sum is 1/1 = 1, which is less than 2. For n=2: 1 + 1/3 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333... < 2. For n=3: 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1 + 0.333 + 0.166 ≈ 1.5 < 2. For n=4: 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/10 ≈ 1 + 0.333 + 0.166 + 0.1 = 1.599... < 2. As n increases, 2n/(n+1) approaches 2. For example, n=100: 200/101 ≈ 1.980... which is still less than 2. So yes, the sum approaches 2 as n approaches infinity, but never actually reaches 2. Therefore, for any finite n, the sum is less than 2.

Therefore, the proof is correct. The key step was recognizing that the sum of reciprocals of triangular numbers telescopes into 2n/(n+1), which is less than 2.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem, but since the telescoping method gives a straightforward proof, I think that's the most efficient way.

But just to make sure, let me think if there's another perspective. For example, using induction.

Base case: n=1. Sum is 1, which is less than 2. True.

Assume that for some n ≥ 1, the sum S_n = 2n/(n+1) < 2. Then S_{n+1} = S_n + 1/t_{n+1} = 2n/(n+1) + 2/[(n+1)(n+2)].

Let me compute that:

2n/(n+1) + 2/[(n+1)(n+2)] = [2n(n+2) + 2] / [(n+1)(n+2)]

Compute numerator: 2n(n+2) + 2 = 2n² + 4n + 2 = 2(n² + 2n + 1) = 2(n + 1)^2.

Therefore, S_{n+1} = 2(n + 1)^2 / [(n + 1)(n + 2)] = 2(n + 1)/(n + 2) = 2(n + 1)/(n + 2).

Which is equal to 2(n + 1)/(n + 2). Now, we need to check that this is less than 2. Well, 2(n + 1)/(n + 2) < 2. Multiply both sides by (n + 2):

2(n + 1) < 2(n + 2)

Divide both sides by 2:

n + 1 < n + 2, which is true. Therefore, by induction, the statement holds for all n ≥ 1.

So this also confirms the result. Therefore, whether by telescoping series or induction, we can prove that the sum is 2n/(n+1) < 2.

Alternatively, maybe someone might think that since the sum approaches 2 as n approaches infinity, then for all finite n, the sum is less than 2. But that's a bit hand-wavy. However, the telescoping series gives an exact expression, which clearly shows that it's 2n/(n+1), which is always less than 2.

Another way to see it is that 2n/(n+1) = 2 - 2/(n+1). Therefore, since 2/(n+1) is positive for all n ≥ 1, the sum is 2 minus a positive number, so less than 2. That's another way to write it. So S_n = 2 - 2/(n+1). Therefore, the sum is always 2 minus something positive, so less than 2. Therefore, done.

Therefore, the proof is complete.

To prove that the sum of the reciprocals of the first $ n $ triangular numbers is less than 2, we begin by recognizing the structure of the triangular numbers and the sum we are examining.

### Step 1: Understanding Triangular Numbers

The $ k $-th triangular number is given by the formula:

$$
t_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
$$

The reciprocal of the $ k $-th triangular number is:

$$
\frac{1}{t_k} = \frac{2}{k(k+1)}
$$

So the sum of the reciprocals of the first $ n $ triangular numbers is:

$$
S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{t_k} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2}{k(k+1)}
$$

---

### Step 2: Telescoping the Series

We can simplify the sum using partial fractions. Note that:

$$
\frac{2}{k(k+1)} = 2\left( \frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)
$$

Thus, the sum becomes:

$$
S_n = 2 \sum_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)
$$

This is a telescoping series. Writing out the terms:

$$
2 \left( \left( \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} \right) + \cdots + \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right) \right)
$$

All intermediate terms cancel out, leaving:

$$
S_n = 2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n+1} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{n}{n+1} = \frac{2n}{n+1}
$$

---

### Step 3: Proving the Inequality

We now show that:

$$
\frac{2n}{n+1} < 2
$$

Multiply both sides by $ n+1 $ (which is positive for all $ n \geq 1 $):

$$
2n < 2(n + 1)
$$

Simplify:

$$
2n < 2n + 2 \Rightarrow 0 < 2
$$

This is always true, so the inequality holds for all positive integers $ n $.

---

### Step 4: Final Conclusion

The sum of the reciprocals of the first $ n $ triangular numbers is:

$$
S_n = \frac{2n}{n+1}
$$

Since $ \frac{2n}{n+1} < 2 $ for all $ n \geq 1 $, the original statement is proven.
