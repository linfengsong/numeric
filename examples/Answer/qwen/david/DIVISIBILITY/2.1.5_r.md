Okay, so I need to solve three parts related to triangular numbers. Let me start by recalling what triangular numbers are. A triangular number is a number that can be represented as a triangle with dots. The formula for the nth triangular number is T_n = n(n + 1)/2. So, for example, T_1 = 1, T_2 = 3, T_3 = 6, T_4 = 10, and so on.

Starting with part (a): Find two triangular numbers whose sum and difference are also triangular numbers. Hmm. Let me think. Let's denote two triangular numbers as T_a and T_b. Then, their sum is T_a + T_b and their difference is |T_a - T_b|. Both of these need to be triangular numbers as well.

First, maybe I should try some small triangular numbers and check if their sum and difference are also triangular. Let me list some triangular numbers:

T_1 = 1

T_2 = 3

T_3 = 6

T_4 = 10

T_5 = 15

T_6 = 21

T_7 = 28

T_8 = 36

T_9 = 45

T_10 = 55

T_11 = 66

T_12 = 78

T_13 = 91

T_14 = 105

T_15 = 120

Okay, so let me try pairs of these numbers. Let me start with T_1 and T_2. Their sum is 1 + 3 = 4. Is 4 a triangular number? Let me check. T_2 is 3, T_3 is 6. 4 isn't a triangular number. The difference is 3 - 1 = 2, which isn't triangular either. So that doesn't work.

Next, T_1 and T_3: sum is 1 + 6 = 7, difference is 6 - 1 = 5. Neither 7 nor 5 are triangular numbers.

T_1 and T_4: sum 1 + 10 = 11, difference 10 - 1 = 9. 11 isn't triangular, 9 isn't either. T_1 and T_5: 1 + 15 = 16, difference 15 - 1 = 14. Neither 16 nor 14 are triangular numbers.

T_1 and T_6: 1 + 21 = 22, difference 21 - 1 = 20. Not triangular. Hmm. Maybe T_1 isn't useful here. Let's try T_2 and T_3. Sum is 3 + 6 = 9, difference is 6 - 3 = 3. 9 isn't triangular, but 3 is. So only one of them is. Not good.

T_2 and T_4: 3 + 10 = 13, difference 10 - 3 = 7. Neither 13 nor 7 are triangular.

T_2 and T_5: 3 + 15 = 18, difference 15 - 3 = 12. 18 isn't triangular, 12 isn't either.

T_2 and T_6: 3 + 21 = 24, difference 21 - 3 = 18. 24 and 18 aren't triangular numbers.

T_2 and T_7: 3 + 28 = 31, difference 28 - 3 = 25. Neither 31 nor 25 are triangular.

T_2 and T_8: 3 + 36 = 39, difference 36 - 3 = 33. Not triangular.

Hmm, maybe T_3 and T_4? Sum is 6 + 10 = 16, difference 10 - 6 = 4. 16 isn't triangular, 4 isn't. T_3 and T_5: 6 + 15 = 21, difference 15 - 6 = 9. 21 is triangular (T_6), 9 isn't. So only one.

T_3 and T_6: 6 + 21 = 27, difference 21 - 6 = 15. 27 isn't triangular, 15 is (T_5). So again, only one.

T_3 and T_7: 6 + 28 = 34, difference 28 - 6 = 22. Neither are triangular.

T_3 and T_8: 6 + 36 = 42, difference 36 - 6 = 30. Not triangular.

T_4 and T_5: 10 + 15 = 25, difference 15 - 10 = 5. 25 isn't triangular, 5 isn't.

T_4 and T_6: 10 + 21 = 31, difference 21 - 10 = 11. Not triangular.

T_4 and T_7: 10 + 28 = 38, difference 28 - 10 = 18. Not triangular.

T_4 and T_8: 10 + 36 = 46, difference 36 - 10 = 26. Not triangular.

T_5 and T_6: 15 + 21 = 36, difference 21 - 15 = 6. 36 is triangular (T_8), 6 is triangular (T_3). Oh! So here we go. T_5 = 15 and T_6 = 21. Their sum is 36, which is T_8, and their difference is 6, which is T_3. So that works. Therefore, part (a) answer is T_5 and T_6?

Wait, but the question says "two triangular numbers", so maybe they can be in any order? Let me check. If we take T_6 and T_5, same thing. So yes, that's a valid pair. So maybe that's the answer for part (a). Let me check if there are others.

But let me check if there are other pairs. For example, T_6 and T_7: 21 + 28 = 49, difference 28 - 21 = 7. 49 isn't triangular, 7 isn't. T_6 and T_8: 21 + 36 = 57, difference 36 - 21 = 15. 57 isn't triangular, 15 is. So only one.

T_7 and T_8: 28 + 36 = 64, difference 36 - 28 = 8. 64 isn't triangular, 8 isn't.

T_5 and T_7: 15 + 28 = 43, difference 28 - 15 = 13. Not triangular.

T_5 and T_9: 15 + 45 = 60, difference 45 - 15 = 30. 60 isn't triangular, 30 isn't.

T_6 and T_9: 21 + 45 = 66, difference 45 - 21 = 24. 66 is T_11, 24 isn't. So only one.

T_7 and T_9: 28 + 45 = 73, difference 45 - 28 = 17. Not triangular.

T_8 and T_9: 36 + 45 = 81, difference 45 - 36 = 9. 81 isn't triangular, 9 isn't.

Wait, maybe there's another pair. Let me check T_1 and T_3? No, we did that. How about T_2 and T_6? 3 + 21 = 24, difference 18. Not triangular. T_3 and T_6: 6 + 21 = 27, difference 15. 15 is triangular, 27 isn't. So only one.

So maybe the first pair I found is the only one? Let me check higher numbers. Maybe T_8 and T_12? Let's see, T_8 is 36, T_12 is 78. Sum is 114, difference is 42. 114 isn't triangular. 42 isn't. How about T_10 and T_15? T_10 is 55, T_15 is 120. Sum is 175, difference 65. Not triangular.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical way to approach this instead of checking all pairs. Let me think.

Suppose we have two triangular numbers T_a and T_b. Let me denote T_a = a(a + 1)/2, T_b = b(b + 1)/2. Then their sum is [a(a + 1) + b(b + 1)] / 2, and their difference is |[a(a + 1) - b(b + 1)]| / 2. Both of these need to be triangular numbers.

Alternatively, maybe we can set up equations. Let me assume that a < b, so that the difference is T_b - T_a. Then, T_b - T_a = T_c, and T_b + T_a = T_d. So we have:

T_b - T_a = T_c

T_b + T_a = T_d

So adding these two equations: 2T_b = T_c + T_d => T_b = (T_c + T_d)/2

Subtracting the first equation from the second: 2T_a = T_d - T_c => T_a = (T_d - T_c)/2

So, since T_a and T_b are triangular numbers, then (T_d - T_c)/2 and (T_c + T_d)/2 must be triangular numbers. Therefore, T_d and T_c must be such that their sum and difference are both even? Wait, not necessarily. Because T_a and T_b are integers, so (T_d - T_c) must be even and (T_c + T_d) must be even. Therefore, T_d and T_c must be both even or both odd. Since triangular numbers: T_n = n(n + 1)/2. For n even, n + 1 is odd, so T_n is even? Wait, n and n + 1 are consecutive integers, so one of them is even. Therefore, T_n is always an integer. But whether it's even or odd?

Let me check:

If n is even: Let n = 2k. Then T_n = 2k(2k + 1)/2 = k(2k + 1). So if k is integer, then T_n is k*(odd). So if k is even, then T_n is even; if k is odd, T_n is odd.

If n is odd: n = 2k + 1. Then T_n = (2k + 1)(2k + 2)/2 = (2k + 1)(k + 1). So again, (2k + 1) is odd, and (k + 1) is integer. So T_n is odd * integer. If k + 1 is even, then T_n is even; if k + 1 is odd, T_n is odd.

So, in general, T_n is even if either n is even and k is even, or n is odd and k + 1 is even. But maybe it's easier to just note that T_n is even or odd depending on n. For example, T_1 = 1 (odd), T_2 = 3 (odd), T_3 = 6 (even), T_4 = 10 (even), T_5 = 15 (odd), T_6 = 21 (odd), T_7 = 28 (even), etc. So the parity alternates in some pattern. So, for example, T_n is even when n ≡ 0 or 3 mod 4? Maybe not, but perhaps not important.

But the point is, T_d and T_c must be both even or both odd so that their sum and difference are even. Therefore, T_d and T_c have the same parity.

But maybe this is getting too abstract. Since I already found one example with T_5 and T_6, which gives T_8 and T_3. Maybe that's the answer. But let me check if there are other pairs. For example, maybe T_3 and T_6? Wait, T_3 is 6, T_6 is 21. Their sum is 27, which is not triangular. Difference is 15, which is triangular. So only one.

Alternatively, maybe T_4 and T_5? Sum is 25, which isn't triangular. Difference is 5, which isn't. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe T_2 and T_5? Sum is 18, difference is 12. Neither are triangular. T_2 and T_7: sum 31, difference 25. Not triangular.

Alternatively, maybe T_8 and T_12? Let me check. T_8 is 36, T_12 is 78. Sum is 114. Is 114 triangular? Let me check. Let's solve T_n = 114. So n(n + 1)/2 = 114 => n^2 + n - 228 = 0. Discriminant is 1 + 912 = 913. sqrt(913) is approx 30.2, so n = (-1 + 30.2)/2 ≈ 14.6. Not integer. So 114 isn't triangular. Difference is 78 - 36 = 42. T_n = 42. n(n + 1)/2 = 42 => n^2 + n - 84 = 0. Discriminant 1 + 336 = 337, sqrt(337) ≈ 18.36. Not integer. So no.

Alternatively, maybe T_10 and T_15? T_10 = 55, T_15 = 120. Sum is 175. Let me check if 175 is triangular. n(n + 1)/2 = 175 => n^2 + n - 350 = 0. Discriminant 1 + 1400 = 1401. sqrt(1401) ≈ 37.44. Not integer. Difference is 65. T_n = 65. n(n + 1)/2 = 65 => n^2 + n - 130 = 0. Discriminant 1 + 520 = 521. Not square. So no.

Alternatively, maybe T_6 and T_10? T_6 = 21, T_10 = 55. Sum is 76. Is 76 triangular? n(n + 1)/2 = 76 => n^2 + n - 152 = 0. Discriminant 1 + 608 = 609. Not square. Difference is 55 - 21 = 34. Not triangular.

Alternatively, maybe T_7 and T_10? 28 + 55 = 83, difference 27. 83 isn't triangular, 27 isn't.

Alternatively, maybe T_3 and T_8? 6 + 36 = 42, which isn't triangular. Difference 30, which isn't.

Alternatively, maybe T_4 and T_7? 10 + 28 = 38, difference 18. 38 isn't, 18 isn't.

Wait, maybe there's another pair. Let me check T_1 and T_8. 1 + 36 = 37, difference 35. Not triangular. T_1 and T_9: 1 + 45 = 46, difference 44. Not.

Alternatively, maybe T_2 and T_7? 3 + 28 = 31, difference 25. Not.

Alternatively, maybe T_3 and T_7? 6 + 28 = 34, difference 22. Not.

Alternatively, maybe T_4 and T_6? 10 + 21 = 31, difference 11. Not.

Alternatively, maybe T_5 and T_7? 15 + 28 = 43, difference 13. Not.

Alternatively, T_5 and T_8? 15 + 36 = 51, difference 21. 51 isn't triangular, 21 is. So only one.

Hmm. Maybe the only pair is T_5 and T_6? Let me check T_6 and T_8? 21 + 36 = 57, difference 15. 57 isn't triangular, 15 is.

Alternatively, T_6 and T_9? 21 + 45 = 66, difference 24. 66 is T_11, 24 isn't. So only one.

So maybe the answer is T_5 and T_6. Let me check again:

T_5 = 15, T_6 = 21. Sum is 36, which is T_8. Difference is 6, which is T_3. So yes. Therefore, part (a) answer is 15 and 21. But the question says "two triangular numbers", so maybe they want the numbers, not the indices. So 15 and 21. Alternatively, maybe they want the indices? The problem says "find the following", so probably the numbers themselves. So I think that's part (a).

Moving on to part (b): Three successive triangular numbers whose product is a perfect square.

Three successive triangular numbers. Let me denote them as T_n, T_{n+1}, T_{n+2}. Their product is T_n * T_{n+1} * T_{n+2}, and this should be a perfect square.

So I need to find n such that T_n * T_{n+1} * T_{n+2} is a perfect square.

First, let me recall that T_k = k(k + 1)/2. Therefore, the product is [n(n + 1)/2] * [(n + 1)(n + 2)/2] * [(n + 2)(n + 3)/2]. Let me write that out:

Product = [n(n + 1)/2] * [(n + 1)(n + 2)/2] * [(n + 2)(n + 3)/2] = [n(n + 1)^2(n + 2)^2(n + 3)] / 8.

So the product is [n(n + 3)(n + 1)^2(n + 2)^2] / 8.

For this to be a perfect square, the numerator must be 8 times a perfect square. Let me think. Let me write it as:

Product = [n(n + 3) * (n + 1)^2 * (n + 2)^2] / 8.

Since (n + 1)^2 and (n + 2)^2 are already squares, the product will be a square if n(n + 3)/8 is a square. Wait, but 8 is 2^3. So let me think. The entire expression is [n(n + 3) * (n + 1)^2 * (n + 2)^2] divided by 8. Therefore, the numerator is n(n + 3) multiplied by squares. So if n(n + 3) is 8 times a square, then the entire expression would be a square.

Alternatively, maybe n(n + 3) must be 8 times a square? Let me check.

Let me denote that the entire expression must be a square. Let me write:

Let me factor the numerator:

n(n + 3) * (n + 1)^2 * (n + 2)^2 = [n(n + 3)] * [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2.

So the product is [n(n + 3)] * [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2. Therefore, the entire product divided by 8 is [n(n + 3)/8] * [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2.

Therefore, for the entire product to be a perfect square, [n(n + 3)/8] must be a perfect square multiplied by some factors. Wait, since [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2 is already a square, then [n(n + 3)/8] must be a square times something? Wait, no. If the entire product is a square, then [n(n + 3)/8] must be a square. Because [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2 is a square, so multiplying by [n(n + 3)/8] must result in a square. Therefore, [n(n + 3)/8] must be a square. Therefore, n(n + 3) must be 8 times a square. So:

n(n + 3) = 8k^2, for some integer k.

Therefore, solving for n in integers such that n(n + 3) = 8k^2.

So, this is a diophantine equation. Let me try to find integer solutions for n and k.

Let me rearrange:

n^2 + 3n - 8k^2 = 0.

This is a quadratic in n. For integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is 9 + 32k^2. So D = 32k^2 + 9 must be a perfect square. Let me denote D = m^2. So:

m^2 - 32k^2 = 9.

This is a Pell-type equation. Let me see. The equation is m^2 - 32k^2 = 9.

I need to find integer solutions (m, k) to this equation. Then, solving for n from the quadratic equation:

n = [-3 ± m]/2. Since n must be positive, we take the positive root: n = [ -3 + m ] / 2. Therefore, m must be odd, since -3 + m must be even. So m must be odd.

Let me try small values of k and see if m^2 = 32k^2 + 9 is a perfect square.

For k = 1: m^2 = 32 + 9 = 41. Not square.

k = 2: 32*4 + 9 = 128 + 9 = 137. Not square.

k = 3: 32*9 + 9 = 288 + 9 = 297. Not square.

k = 4: 32*16 + 9 = 512 + 9 = 521. Not square.

k = 5: 32*25 + 9 = 800 + 9 = 809. Not square.

k = 6: 32*36 + 9 = 1152 + 9 = 1161. Not square.

k = 7: 32*49 + 9 = 1568 + 9 = 1577. Not square.

k = 8: 32*64 + 9 = 2048 + 9 = 2057. Not square.

k = 9: 32*81 + 9 = 2592 + 9 = 2601. Wait, 2601 is 51^2. Because 50^2 = 2500, 51^2 = 2601. Yes! So m = 51, k = 9.

Therefore, for k = 9, m = 51. Then, n = (-3 + 51)/2 = 48/2 = 24. So n = 24. Let me check if this works.

So n = 24. Then, the three successive triangular numbers are T_24, T_25, T_26.

Let me compute their product. But before that, let me check if n(n + 3) = 24*27 = 648. And 8k^2 = 8*(9)^2 = 8*81 = 648. Yes, that's correct. So that works.

So n = 24. Therefore, the three successive triangular numbers are T_24, T_25, T_26. Let me check if their product is a perfect square.

Alternatively, maybe there are smaller solutions? Let me check if there are smaller k.

Wait, for k = 0: m^2 = 9, so m = 3. Then n = (-3 + 3)/2 = 0. But n = 0 would correspond to T_0 = 0, which is trivial, but maybe not considered here. The problem says "three successive triangular numbers", so n should be positive integer. So n = 0 is invalid.

So the next solution is k = 9, n = 24. Let me check if there are other solutions. For example, maybe k = 12? Let me check k = 12: m^2 = 32*(144) + 9 = 4608 + 9 = 4617. Not square. sqrt(4617) ≈ 67.95, not integer.

Alternatively, maybe there's another solution with smaller k? Let me check k = 1, 2, ..., up to 9. We saw that k=9 is the first non-trivial solution. Let me check for k=  something else. For example, maybe negative k? But since k^2 is positive, negative k would not give new solutions.

Alternatively, maybe there's another solution with m and k. Let me think about the Pell equation. The equation is m^2 - 32k^2 = 9. The solutions can be generated from the minimal solution. The minimal solution is (m, k) = (51, 9). Let me check if there are other solutions.

But maybe for the purpose of this problem, n=24 is the smallest solution. Let me check if the product of T_24, T_25, T_26 is indeed a perfect square.

First, compute T_24 = 24*25/2 = 300.

T_25 = 25*26/2 = 325.

T_26 = 26*27/2 = 351.

Product: 300 * 325 * 351.

Let me compute this. First, compute 300 * 325. 300*325 = 97,500. Then, 97,500 * 351. Let me compute this.

But instead of calculating the exact value, maybe I can check if it's a square. Alternatively, since we derived that n(n + 3) = 8k^2, and the product is [n(n + 3)/8] * [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2, which would be k^2 * [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2, which is [k(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2. Therefore, the product is a perfect square. Therefore, regardless of the value of k, as long as n(n + 3) = 8k^2, the product is a square. Therefore, since we have n = 24, k = 9, then the product is [9*(24 + 1)*(24 + 2)]^2 = [9*25*26]^2. Which is indeed a perfect square. Therefore, the product is a square. Therefore, T_24, T_25, T_26 is a valid solution.

But maybe there are smaller n? Let me check for n=1, 2, etc. Let me check for n=1: T_1=1, T_2=3, T_3=6. Product is 1*3*6=18, not square.

n=2: T_2=3, T_3=6, T_4=10. Product 3*6*10=180, not square.

n=3: T_3=6, T_4=10, T_5=15. Product 6*10*15=900. Wait, 900 is 30^2. Oh! Wait, that's a perfect square. Wait, so n=3? But according to our previous equation, n(n + 3) = 3*6 = 18. 8k^2 = 18 => k^2 = 18/8 = 9/4, which is not integer. So that contradicts our previous conclusion? Wait, but the product is 900, which is a square. What's happening here?

Wait, let me check again. For n=3, the three successive triangular numbers are T_3=6, T_4=10, T_5=15. Their product is 6*10*15 = 900 = 30^2. So that is a perfect square. But according to our previous equation, n(n + 3) = 3*6 = 18. Then according to our previous logic, the product should be [n(n + 3)/8] * [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2. So 18/8 * (4*5)^2 = (9/4) * 400 = 900. Which is correct. But 9/4 is not an integer, but multiplied by 400 gives 900. So the entire expression is a square even though [n(n + 3)/8] is not an integer. Therefore, my previous reasoning was flawed. I thought that [n(n + 3)/8] must be a square, but actually, since [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2 is multiplied by [n(n + 3)/8], the entire expression is a square if [n(n + 3)/8] is a rational square, but in this case, it's 9/4, which is (3/2)^2. Therefore, the entire product is [ (3/2)^2 * (4*5)^2 ] = [ (3/2 * 4*5) ]^2 = [3*10]^2 = 30^2. Therefore, the product is a square even if [n(n + 3)/8] is not an integer, as long as it's a rational square.

Therefore, my mistake was assuming that [n(n + 3)/8] must be an integer. But actually, since the entire expression is a square, even if [n(n + 3)/8] is a fraction, as long as when multiplied by [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2, it becomes a square. Therefore, in this case, n=3 is a solution. Therefore, there is a smaller solution. Therefore, my previous approach was missing this case.

Therefore, I need to re-examine the problem. Let me think again.

The product is [n(n + 3)/8] * [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2. For this to be a square, [n(n + 3)/8] must be a square times some factors. But since [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2 is a square, then [n(n + 3)/8] must be a square times a square factor? Wait, no. Let me think.

Suppose that [n(n + 3)/8] * [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2 is a square. Let me denote A = n(n + 3)/8 and B = [(n + 1)(n + 2)]^2. Then, A * B is a square. Since B is a square, then A must be a square times a square factor? Wait, no. If A * square is a square, then A must be a square times a square factor? Wait, more accurately, if A * square is a square, then A must be a square times a square factor? Or more precisely, A must be a square multiplied by a square factor? Wait, no. Let me think in terms of prime factors.

Suppose that A * B is a square. Since B is a square, then A must be a square multiplied by some factors that are already in B. But since B is a square, the prime factors of A must be such that when combined with those in B, they all have even exponents. Therefore, A must be a square times a square factor? Wait, no. If B is a square, then A must be a square times a square factor? No, that's not necessarily. For example, if A is 2 and B is 8, then A * B = 16, which is a square. So 2 is not a square, but multiplied by 8 (which is 2^3) gives 16, which is square. Therefore, the key is that A must be a rational square, but multiplied by B (a square) gives a square. Therefore, A must be a square times a square factor? Wait, maybe not. The key is that A * B is a square, so the exponents of all primes in A * B must be even. Since B is a square, all exponents in B are even. Therefore, the exponents of primes in A must be even as well. Therefore, A must be a square. Wait, but in the case of n=3, A = 3*6 / 8 = 18/8 = 9/4, which is (3/2)^2, a square. Therefore, A is a square. Therefore, my previous reasoning was correct. So A must be a square. Therefore, n(n + 3)/8 must be a square. Therefore, n(n + 3) must be 8 times a square. But in the case of n=3, n(n + 3) = 3*6 = 18 = 8*(9/4). But 9/4 is not integer. However, if we consider rational numbers, then 18/8 = 9/4 is a square. Therefore, the equation n(n + 3) = 8k^2 must hold for some rational k. However, since n is integer, k must be rational. Let me write k = p/q, reduced fraction. Then n(n + 3) = 8*(p/q)^2. Multiply both sides by q^2: n(n + 3)q^2 = 8p^2. Therefore, this is a diophantine equation. However, maybe there are solutions where k is not integer. However, in our previous case, n=3, k= 3/2. Therefore, k is rational. Therefore, maybe there are more solutions. Therefore, the equation n(n + 3) = 8k^2 has solutions where k is rational. However, solving this in integers is more complicated. Therefore, perhaps I need to look for integer solutions where n(n + 3) is 8 times a square. But in the case of n=3, 3*6=18=8*(9/4). Therefore, not integer. Therefore, my previous approach was missing this case.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me think. The product is [n(n + 1)/2] * [(n + 1)(n + 2)/2] * [(n + 2)(n + 3)/2] = [n(n + 1)^2(n + 2)^2(n + 3)] / 8. Let me write this as [ (n + 1)(n + 2) ]^2 * [n(n + 3)] / 8. Therefore, for this to be a square, [n(n + 3)] / 8 must be a square. Therefore, n(n + 3) must be 8 times a square. However, in the case of n=3, n(n + 3) = 18 = 8*(9/4). Therefore, if we allow k to be rational, then 9/4 is a square. Therefore, the problem is that in our previous equation, we considered k to be integer, but in reality, k can be rational. Therefore, maybe there are more solutions.

Alternatively, maybe I need to think of n(n + 3) as 8 times a square. Let me think of n(n + 3) = 8k^2. Let me rearrange:

n^2 + 3n - 8k^2 = 0.

This is a quadratic in n. For integer n and k, the discriminant must be a perfect square. As before, discriminant D = 9 + 32k^2 = m^2.

So m^2 - 32k^2 = 9.

Earlier, we found that (m, k) = (51, 9) is a solution. Also, (m, k) = (3, 0) is a solution, but that gives n=0.

But also, for n=3, we have k= 3/2. Let me check if that satisfies the equation m^2 - 32k^2 = 9.

If k = 3/2, then m^2 = 9 + 32*(9/4) = 9 + 72 = 81. So m = 9. Therefore, m=9, k=3/2. So this is another solution. Therefore, there are solutions with rational k. Therefore, the equation m^2 - 32k^2 = 9 has infinitely many solutions, both integer and rational.

Therefore, to find integer solutions for n, we need to find integer k such that m^2 - 32k^2 = 9, and then n = [ -3 + m ] / 2 is integer.

For example, with k=9, m=51, n=24.

With k=3/2, m=9, n=( -3 + 9 ) / 2 = 6/2 = 3. Which is the solution we found earlier. Therefore, n=3 is a solution.

Therefore, the equation has solutions for both integer k and rational k. Therefore, to find all integer n, we need to find solutions where m and k are integers or rationals such that n is integer.

But since we are looking for integer n, let me see if there are other solutions with integer k.

For example, let me check for k= 3/2, but that's not integer. However, if I can find solutions where k is rational, but when plugged into the equation for n, gives integer n.

Alternatively, maybe there are other integer solutions. Let me check for m and k integers.

We have the equation m^2 - 32k^2 = 9.

We found (m, k) = (51, 9) and (3, 0). Are there others?

Let me check for m= 9, k= 3/2, but that's not integer. How about m=  something else?

Let me try m=  9 + 32k^2. Wait, not helpful.

Alternatively, think of the equation m^2 - 32k^2 = 9. This is similar to Pell's equation. The general solution can be generated from the minimal solution.

The minimal solution for m^2 - 32k^2 = 9 is (m, k) = (9, 3/2) but that's not integer. Wait, but earlier we had (m, k) = (51, 9). Let me check if (m, k) = (51, 9) is a solution: 51^2 - 32*(9)^2 = 2601 - 32*81 = 2601 - 2592 = 9. Yes. So that's a solution.

To find other solutions, we can use the theory of Pell equations. The equation m^2 - 32k^2 = 9 can be considered as a Pell-type equation.

The general solution can be generated from the minimal solution. However, since the right-hand side is not 1, it's a bit more complex. However, we can use the fact that if (m, k) is a solution, then multiplying by the fundamental solution of the Pell equation m^2 - 32k^2 = 1 can generate new solutions.

The fundamental solution for Pell equation x^2 - 32y^2 = 1 is (x, y) = (17, 5), since 17^2 - 32*(5)^2 = 289 - 800 = -511? Wait, no. Wait, 17^2 = 289, 32*5^2 = 32*25 = 800. 289 - 800 = -511. Not 1. Wait, maybe I need to find the minimal solution.

Let me check for x^2 - 32y^2 = 1.

Trying small y:

y=1: x^2 = 1 + 32 = 33, not square.

y=2: x^2 = 1 + 128 = 129, nope.

y=3: 1 + 288 = 289 = 17^2. Yes! So (x, y) = (17, 3) is a solution. Therefore, the fundamental solution is (17, 3).

Therefore, solutions to x^2 - 32y^2 = 1 can be generated by (17 + 3√32)^n.

Therefore, for our equation m^2 - 32k^2 = 9, once we have a solution, we can generate more solutions by multiplying by the fundamental solution of the Pell equation.

So, starting with the solution (m, k) = (9, 3/2), but since that's not integer, let me use the integer solution (51, 9). Then, multiplying by the fundamental solution (17 + 3√32):

Let me denote the solution (m, k) = (51, 9). Multiply by (17 + 3√32):

(51 + 9√32)(17 + 3√32) = 51*17 + 51*3√32 + 9√32*17 + 9√32*3√32.

Compute each term:

51*17 = 867.

51*3√32 = 153√32.

9*17√32 = 153√32.

9*3*(√32)^2 = 27*32 = 864.

Therefore, total is 867 + 864 + (153√32 + 153√32) = 1731 + 306√32.

Therefore, the new solution is m = 1731, k = 306/2 = 153? Wait, no. Wait, the multiplication is (m + k√32)(17 + 3√32) = (m*17 + k*3*32) + (m*3 + k*17)√32. Wait, perhaps I need to do it more carefully.

Actually, when you multiply (a + b√d)(c + e√d) = (ac + b e d) + (ae + bc)√d.

In our case, d = 32. So:

Let me write (m + k√32)(17 + 3√32) = m*17 + m*3√32 + k√32*17 + k√32*3√32.

Which is:

= 17m + 3m√32 + 17k√32 + 3k*(√3
