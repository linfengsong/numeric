Okay, so I need to prove that for any positive integer n and any integer a, the greatest common divisor of a and a + n divides n. And then specifically, show that gcd(a, a + 1) is 1. Let me start by recalling what the greatest common divisor (gcd) is. The gcd of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. 

First, let me tackle the general case: proving that gcd(a, a + n) divides n. Let me denote d as the gcd of a and a + n. So, d = gcd(a, a + n). I need to show that d divides n. 

Hmm, how can I relate the gcd of a and a + n to n? Maybe I can use the property that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a) when b > a. Wait, let me check that. If I have gcd(a, a + n), then if I subtract a from a + n, I get n. So, gcd(a, a + n) = gcd(a, (a + n) - a) = gcd(a, n). Oh! So, that simplifies things. Therefore, gcd(a, a + n) is equal to gcd(a, n). Therefore, since d is the gcd of a and n, it must divide n. That seems straightforward. 

Wait, but let me verify this with an example. Let me take a = 4 and n = 6. Then, a + n = 10. So, gcd(4, 10) is 2. And gcd(4, 6) is also 2. And 2 divides 6, which is true. Another example: a = 5, n = 3. Then, a + n = 8. gcd(5, 8) is 1, and gcd(5, 3) is 1, which divides 3. So that works. 

So, in general, gcd(a, a + n) = gcd(a, n). Therefore, since the gcd(a, n) divides n, then indeed, the gcd(a, a + n) divides n. Therefore, that part is proven. 

Now, the second part is to show that gcd(a, a + 1) = 1. Well, using the same logic as above, gcd(a, a + 1) = gcd(a, (a + 1) - a) = gcd(a, 1). And the gcd of any number and 1 is 1, since 1 divides every integer. Therefore, gcd(a, 1) = 1. Therefore, gcd(a, a + 1) = 1. 

But let me check with examples. Let's take a = 3, then a + 1 = 4. gcd(3, 4) is 1. If a = 5, then a + 1 = 6, gcd(5, 6) is 1. If a = 0, then a + 1 = 1, gcd(0, 1) is 1. Wait, but the problem says "any integer a". So, even if a is zero? Well, gcd(0, 1) is 1, since the divisors of 0 are all integers, but the gcd is the greatest common divisor, which would be 1 because 1 divides 0 and 1. So that works. 

But maybe the problem specifies a as a positive integer? Wait, the original problem says "for a positive integer n and any integer a". So n is positive, but a can be any integer, positive or negative. However, gcd is always positive, and it's the same for positive and negative numbers because divisors are considered in absolute value. So, even if a is negative, gcd(a, a + n) is the same as gcd(|a|, |a + n|). 

But in any case, the logic holds. So, the key step is that gcd(a, a + n) = gcd(a, n). Therefore, since gcd(a, n) divides n, then the original gcd divides n. And for the specific case of n = 1, since gcd(a, a + 1) = gcd(a, 1) = 1. 

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose a is zero. Then, gcd(0, 0 + 1) = gcd(0, 1). But gcd(0, 1) is 1. Which is correct. So even if a is zero, it still holds. 

Alternatively, if a is negative. Let me take a = -3, n = 5. Then a + n = 2. gcd(-3, 2) is 1. Which is the same as gcd(3, 2) = 1. So that works. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that gcd(a, a + 1) is 1. 

But maybe I need to formalize the first part more carefully. Let me try to write it step by step. 

Let d = gcd(a, a + n). Then, by the property of gcd, we have that d divides a and d divides a + n. Therefore, d divides (a + n) - a = n. Therefore, d divides n. Therefore, gcd(a, a + n) divides n. 

Alternatively, using the Euclidean algorithm, which states that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a) when b > a. So, if we take b = a + n, then gcd(a, a + n) = gcd(a, n). Therefore, since gcd(a, n) divides n, then so does the original gcd. 

Therefore, that's the proof. 

So, for the second part, substituting n = 1, we have gcd(a, a + 1) = gcd(a, 1) = 1. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, a + 1) divides 1, and the only positive divisor of 1 is 1 itself, so the gcd must be 1. 

Therefore, that's the conclusion. 

But let me check if there's another way to think about it. For example, if there is a common divisor of a and a + 1, then it must divide their difference, which is 1. Therefore, the only possible common divisor is 1. Therefore, gcd(a, a + 1) = 1. 

Yes, that's another way to see it. So, if d divides both a and a + 1, then d divides (a + 1) - a = 1. Therefore, d divides 1, so d = 1. Therefore, the gcd is 1. 

So, both approaches confirm that. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that for any integer a and positive integer n, gcd(a, a + n) divides n, and in particular, when n = 1, gcd(a, a + 1) = 1. 

I think that's the proof. Let me check if there's any possible mistake here. 

Wait, in the first part, I used the property that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a). But is that always true? Let me recall. The Euclidean algorithm says that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - ka) for any integer k. So, in this case, if we take k = 1, then it's gcd(a, b - a). But this is valid only if b > a? Or is it valid regardless? 

Actually, the Euclidean algorithm works regardless of the sign. For example, if b < a, then we can take k = 1, and then b - a is negative, but the gcd is the same as gcd(a, |b - a|). So, in general, gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, |b - a|). Therefore, in our case, since we have gcd(a, a + n) = gcd(a, (a + n) - a) = gcd(a, n). Therefore, regardless of the value of n, as long as n is positive. 

But since n is given as a positive integer, then (a + n) - a = n, which is positive. Therefore, the property holds. 

Therefore, the first part is correct. 

Another way to think about it is that if d divides a and a + n, then d divides their difference, which is n. Therefore, d divides n. Therefore, the gcd(a, a + n) divides n. 

Therefore, that's another way to see it. 

So, in conclusion, both parts are proven. 

Therefore, the answer is that gcd(a, a + 1) is 1, which is proven by showing that gcd(a, a + 1) = gcd(a, 1) = 1.

**Final Answer**

To prove that for any positive integer $ n $ and any integer $ a $, the greatest common divisor $ \gcd(a, a + n) $ divides $ n $, and that in particular $ \gcd(a, a + 1) = 1 $, we proceed with the following steps:

---

### **Step 1: General Case — Proving $ \gcd(a, a + n) \mid n $**

Let $ d = \gcd(a, a + n) $. By the **definition of the greatest common divisor**, $ d $ must divide both $ a $ and $ a + n $. Therefore, it must also divide their **difference**:

$$
(a + n) - a = n
$$

So, $ d \mid n $. This shows that the gcd of $ a $ and $ a + n $ divides $ n $.

Alternatively, using the **Euclidean algorithm**, we know:

$$
\gcd(a, a + n) = \gcd(a, (a + n) - a) = \gcd(a, n)
$$

Hence, $ \gcd(a, a + n) = \gcd(a, n) $, and since $ \gcd(a, n) \mid n $, it follows that $ \gcd(a, a + n) \mid n $.

---

### **Step 2: Specific Case — Proving $ \gcd(a, a + 1) = 1 $**

Let us now specialize the result above by taking $ n = 1 $. Then:

$$
\gcd(a, a + 1) = \gcd(a, 1)
$$

But the **greatest common divisor of any integer and 1 is always 1**, because 1 divides every integer. Therefore:

$$
\gcd(a, a + 1) = \gcd(a, 1) = 1
$$

Alternatively, consider that if $ d \mid a $ and $ d \mid a + 1 $, then $ d \mid (a + 1) - a = 1 $. The only positive integer that divides 1 is 1 itself, so $ d = 1 $, and thus:

$$
\gcd(a, a + 1) = 1
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

We have shown that for any integer $ a $ and positive integer $ n $, $ \gcd(a, a + n) \mid n $. In particular, when $ n = 1 $, this implies:

$$
\gcd(a, a + 1) = 1
$$
