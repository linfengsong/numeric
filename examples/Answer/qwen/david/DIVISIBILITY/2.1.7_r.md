Okay, so I need to show that the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is always a cube. Hmm, let me start by recalling what triangular numbers are. A triangular number is a number that can be represented as a triangle with dots. The formula for the nth triangular number is T_n = n(n + 1)/2. Right?

So, if I have two consecutive triangular numbers, say T_n and T_{n+1}, then their squares would be [T_n]^2 and [T_{n+1}]^2. The problem says that the difference between these squares is always a cube. Let me write that down:

Difference = [T_{n+1}]^2 - [T_n]^2.

And this difference should be equal to some cube, say k^3. So I need to show that this difference is indeed a cube for any n.

First, maybe I should compute [T_{n+1}]^2 - [T_n]^2 using the formula for triangular numbers. Let me do that.

First, T_n = n(n + 1)/2. Therefore, T_{n+1} = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Let me compute the squares:

[T_{n+1}]^2 = [(n + 1)(n + 2)/2]^2.

[T_n]^2 = [n(n + 1)/2]^2.

So the difference is:

[(n + 1)^2(n + 2)^2 / 4] - [n^2(n + 1)^2 / 4].

Factor out common terms. Both terms have (n + 1)^2 / 4. So:

[(n + 1)^2 / 4] * [(n + 2)^2 - n^2].

Let me compute (n + 2)^2 - n^2. Expanding (n + 2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4. Subtract n^2 gives 4n + 4. So:

Difference = [(n + 1)^2 / 4] * (4n + 4).

Simplify 4n + 4 as 4(n + 1). Therefore:

Difference = [(n + 1)^2 / 4] * 4(n + 1) = (n + 1)^2 * (n + 1) = (n + 1)^3.

Wait, so the difference is (n + 1)^3? That would mean that the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is the cube of (n + 1). Therefore, it's a cube. So that's the result?

But let me check with an example to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's take n = 1.

T_1 = 1(1 + 1)/2 = 1. T_2 = 2(3)/2 = 3. Then the difference is 3^2 - 1^2 = 9 - 1 = 8. Which is 2^3. And (n + 1)^3 when n = 1 is 2^3 = 8. Correct.

Another example, n = 2. T_2 = 3, T_3 = 6. Difference is 6^2 - 3^2 = 36 - 9 = 27. Which is 3^3. And (n + 1)^3 = 3^3 = 27. Correct again.

Another example, n = 3. T_3 = 6, T_4 = 10. Difference is 100 - 36 = 64. Which is 4^3. And (3 + 1)^3 = 4^3 = 64. Correct.

Okay, so that seems to hold. Therefore, the difference is indeed (n + 1)^3, which is a cube. Therefore, the statement is proven.

Wait, but let me check my algebra again. Let me go through the steps again.

Starting with [T_{n+1}]^2 - [T_n]^2. Expanding that:

[(n + 1)(n + 2)/2]^2 - [n(n + 1)/2]^2.

Factor out [(n + 1)/2]^2:

[(n + 1)/2]^2 * [(n + 2)^2 - n^2].

Then (n + 2)^2 - n^2 is 4n + 4. So:

[(n + 1)^2 / 4] * 4(n + 1) = (n + 1)^3. Yes, that's correct. The 4 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving (n + 1)^3.

Therefore, the difference is indeed (n + 1)^3, which is a cube. Therefore, the problem is solved.

But wait, the problem says "the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is always a cube". So, according to this, it's (n + 1)^3, which is a cube. Therefore, it's proven.

But let me check another example where n is larger, say n = 4. T_4 = 10, T_5 = 15. Difference is 15^2 - 10^2 = 225 - 100 = 125. Which is 5^3. And (4 + 1)^3 = 125. Correct again.

Therefore, this seems to hold. Therefore, the conclusion is that the difference is (n + 1)^3, which is a cube. Therefore, the statement is proven.

But maybe I need to write it more formally? Let me try to structure the proof properly.

Let T_n = n(n + 1)/2. Then T_{n+1} = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Then:

[T_{n+1}]^2 - [T_n]^2 = [(n + 1)^2(n + 2)^2 / 4] - [n^2(n + 1)^2 / 4] = [(n + 1)^2 / 4][(n + 2)^2 - n^2] = [(n + 1)^2 / 4][4n + 4] = [(n + 1)^2 / 4][4(n + 1)] = (n + 1)^3.

Therefore, the difference is (n + 1)^3, which is a perfect cube. Therefore, the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is always a cube.

Yes, that seems solid. So the answer is that the difference is (n + 1)^3, which is a cube. Therefore, the statement is proven.

But maybe the problem expects a different approach? Or maybe there's a different way to see it?

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Let me try that.

Let me set a = T_{n+1}, b = T_n. Then a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b).

Compute a - b = T_{n+1} - T_n. Let me compute that:

T_{n+1} - T_n = [(n + 1)(n + 2)/2] - [n(n + 1)/2] = [(n + 1)/2][(n + 2) - n] = [(n + 1)/2][2] = n + 1.

Then a + b = T_{n+1} + T_n = [(n + 1)(n + 2)/2] + [n(n + 1)/2] = [(n + 1)/2][(n + 2) + n] = [(n + 1)/2][2n + 2] = [(n + 1)/2][2(n + 1)] = (n + 1)^2.

Therefore, a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b) = (n + 1)(n + 1)^2 = (n + 1)^3. Same result. So that's another way to see it. Therefore, the difference is (n + 1)^3. Therefore, it is a cube. So that's the proof.

Therefore, the answer is that the difference is (n + 1)^3, which is a cube. Therefore, the statement is proven.

So I think this is correct. The key was to recognize that the difference of squares can be factored into (a - b)(a + b), and then compute each part. Alternatively, expanding the squares directly also leads to the same conclusion.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the difference is always a cube, specifically the cube of (n + 1).

**Final Answer**
The difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is always a cube, specifically \boxed{(n + 1)^3}.

To show that the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is always a cube, we begin by recalling the formula for the $ n $-th triangular number:

$$
T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

Let us consider two consecutive triangular numbers: $ T_n $ and $ T_{n+1} $. The difference between their squares is:

$$
[T_{n+1}]^2 - [T_n]^2
$$

We compute each term using the formula for triangular numbers:

- $ T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $
- $ T_{n+1} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} $

Now, compute the squares:

$$
[T_{n+1}]^2 = \left( \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{(n+1)^2(n+2)^2}{4}
$$
$$
[T_n]^2 = \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}
$$

Subtracting the two:

$$
[T_{n+1}]^2 - [T_n]^2 = \frac{(n+1)^2(n+2)^2}{4} - \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}
$$

Factor out the common term $ \frac{(n+1)^2}{4} $:

$$
= \frac{(n+1)^2}{4} \left[ (n+2)^2 - n^2 \right]
$$

Now compute the expression in the brackets:

$$
(n+2)^2 - n^2 = (n^2 + 4n + 4) - n^2 = 4n + 4 = 4(n + 1)
$$

Substitute back:

$$
[T_{n+1}]^2 - [T_n]^2 = \frac{(n+1)^2}{4} \cdot 4(n+1) = (n+1)^3
$$

---

This result shows that the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is:

$$
(n+1)^3
$$

Since any cube of an integer is a perfect cube, this confirms that the difference is always a cube.

**Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{(n + 1)^3}
$$
