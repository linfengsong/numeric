Okay, so I need to use the Euclidean Algorithm to find integers x and y for each of these equations. Let me start with part (a): gcd(56, 72) = 56x + 72y. 

First, I remember that the Euclidean Algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers. But here, I also need to find coefficients x and y such that the gcd is a linear combination of the two numbers. That sounds like the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Right, so I need to not only find the gcd but also keep track of the coefficients during the algorithm.

Let me recall how the Extended Euclidean Algorithm works. It's similar to the regular Euclidean Algorithm, but at each step, you also keep track of coefficients that express the remainder as a linear combination of the original numbers. 

Starting with part (a): gcd(56, 72). Let me apply the Euclidean Algorithm step by step.

First, divide 72 by 56. 56 goes into 72 once with a remainder. 56*1 = 56, so 72 - 56 = 16. So, 72 = 56*1 + 16.

Now, take 56 and divide by 16. 16*3 = 48, so 56 - 48 = 8. So, 56 = 16*3 + 8.

Next, divide 16 by 8. 8*2 = 16, so remainder is 0. Therefore, gcd is 8.

Now, to find x and y such that 8 = 56x + 72y. Let me work backwards through the equations.

Starting from the second last step: 8 = 56 - 16*3.

But from the first step, we had 16 = 72 - 56*1. So substitute that into the equation for 8:

8 = 56 - (72 - 56*1)*3.

Let me compute that:

8 = 56 - 3*72 + 3*56*1

Combine like terms:

8 = (1 + 3)*56 - 3*72 = 4*56 - 3*72.

Therefore, x is 4 and y is -3. Let me check that: 56*4 + 72*(-3) = 224 - 216 = 8. Yes, that works. So part (a) is done. 

Moving on to part (b): gcd(24, 138) = 24x + 138y.

Again, let me apply the Euclidean Algorithm. Let me start by dividing 138 by 24.

24*5 = 120, so 138 - 120 = 18. Therefore, 138 = 24*5 + 18.

Next, divide 24 by 18. 18*1 = 18, remainder 6. So 24 = 18*1 + 6.

Then divide 18 by 6. 6*3 = 18, remainder 0. So gcd is 6.

Now, working backwards to find coefficients. Starting from 6 = 24 - 18*1.

But from the first step, 18 = 138 - 24*5. Substitute that into the equation:

6 = 24 - (138 - 24*5)*1 = 24 - 138 + 24*5 = (1 + 5)*24 - 138 = 6*24 - 138*1.

Therefore, x is 6 and y is -1. Let me check: 24*6 + 138*(-1) = 144 - 138 = 6. Correct. So part (b) is done.

Now part (c): gcd(119, 272) = 119x + 272y.

Let me perform the Euclidean Algorithm. Let me divide 272 by 119.

119*2 = 238. 272 - 238 = 34. So 272 = 119*2 + 34.

Next, divide 119 by 34. 34*3 = 102. 119 - 102 = 17. So 119 = 34*3 + 17.

Then divide 34 by 17. 17*2 = 34, remainder 0. Therefore, gcd is 17.

Now, working backwards. Starting from 17 = 119 - 34*3.

But from the first step, 34 = 272 - 119*2. Substitute that into the equation:

17 = 119 - (272 - 119*2)*3 = 119 - 272*3 + 119*6 = (1 + 6)*119 - 272*3 = 7*119 - 3*272.

Therefore, x is 7 and y is -3. Let me check: 119*7 + 272*(-3) = 833 - 816 = 17. Correct. So part (c) is done.

Now part (d): gcd(1769, 2378) = 1769x + 2378y.

This seems more complex. Let me proceed step by step. 

First, apply the Euclidean Algorithm to 1769 and 2378.

Let me divide 2378 by 1769. Let me see how many times 1769 fits into 2378. 1769*1 = 1769. Subtract that from 2378: 2378 - 1769 = 609. So, 2378 = 1769*1 + 609.

Next, divide 1769 by 609. Let me compute 609*2 = 1218. 1769 - 1218 = 551. So 1769 = 609*2 + 551.

Then divide 609 by 551. 551*1 = 551. 609 - 551 = 58. So 609 = 551*1 + 58.

Next, divide 551 by 58. Let me see. 58*9 = 522. 551 - 522 = 29. So 551 = 58*9 + 29.

Then divide 58 by 29. 29*2 = 58, remainder 0. So gcd is 29.

Now, working backwards to find coefficients. Let me write down all the steps:

1. 2378 = 1769*1 + 609
2. 1769 = 609*2 + 551
3. 609 = 551*1 + 58
4. 551 = 58*9 + 29
5. 58 = 29*2 + 0

So, gcd is 29. Now, express 29 as a combination.

Starting from step 4: 29 = 551 - 58*9.

From step 3: 58 = 609 - 551*1. Substitute into above:

29 = 551 - (609 - 551*1)*9 = 551 - 609*9 + 551*9 = (1 + 9)*551 - 609*9 = 10*551 - 609*9.

Now, from step 2: 551 = 1769 - 609*2. Substitute into above:

29 = 10*(1769 - 609*2) - 609*9 = 10*1769 - 20*609 - 9*609 = 10*1769 - 29*609.

Now, from step 1: 609 = 2378 - 1769*1. Substitute into above:

29 = 10*1769 - 29*(2378 - 1769*1) = 10*1769 - 29*2378 + 29*1769 = (10 + 29)*1769 - 29*2378 = 39*1769 - 29*2378.

Therefore, x is 39 and y is -29. Let me check: 1769*39 + 2378*(-29). 

Wait, but let me compute that. Let me check if that equals 29. 

First, compute 1769*39. Let me compute 1769*40 = 70,760, subtract 1769: 70,760 - 1,769 = 68,991.

Then compute 2378*29. Let me compute 2378*30 = 71,340, subtract 2378: 71,340 - 2,378 = 68,962.

So, 68,991 - 68,962 = 29. Correct. Therefore, 1769*39 - 2378*29 = 29. Therefore, x = 39, y = -29. 

But wait, the equation is gcd = 1769x + 2378y. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, part (d) is done.

Let me just recap all the parts to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

For (a): 8 = 4*56 - 3*72. Correct.

For (b): 6 = 6*24 - 1*138. Correct.

For (c): 17 = 7*119 - 3*272. Correct.

For (d): 29 = 39*1769 - 29*2378. Correct.

I think that's all. Let me check if there's another way to represent the coefficients, but since the question just asks for integers x and y, there are infinitely many solutions, but the ones found via the Extended Euclidean Algorithm are the ones that are typically required. So I think these are correct.

**Final Answer**

(a) $\boxed{4}$ and $\boxed{-3}$

(b) $\boxed{6}$ and $\boxed{-1}$

(c) $\boxed{7}$ and $\boxed{-3}$

(d) $\boxed{39}$ and $\boxed{-29}$

To solve each of the given problems, we apply the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**, which not only computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers but also finds integers $ x $ and $ y $ such that:

$$
\gcd(a, b) = ax + by
$$

We proceed step-by-step for each part:

### **(a) $ \gcd(56, 72) = 56x + 72y $**

**Step 1:**  
$$
72 = 56 \cdot 1 + 16
$$  
$$
56 = 16 \cdot 3 + 8
$$  
$$
16 = 8 \cdot 2 + 0
$$  
So, $ \gcd(56, 72) = 8 $

**Step 2:**  
Back-substitute:
$$
8 = 56 - 16 \cdot 3
$$  
$$
16 = 72 - 56 \cdot 1
$$  
$$
8 = 56 - (72 - 56 \cdot 1) \cdot 3 = 4 \cdot 56 - 3 \cdot 72
$$

**Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{4} \text{ and } \boxed{-3}
$$

### **(b) $ \gcd(24, 138) = 24x + 138y $**

**Step 1:**  
$$
138 = 24 \cdot 5 + 18
$$  
$$
24 = 18 \cdot 1 + 6
$$  
$$
18 = 6 \cdot 3 + 0
$$  
So, $ \gcd(24, 138) = 6 $

**Step 2:**  
Back-substitute:
$$
6 = 24 - 18 \cdot 1
$$  
$$
18 = 138 - 24 \cdot 5
$$  
$$
6 = 24 - (138 - 24 \cdot 5) = 6 \cdot 24 - 1 \cdot 138
$$

**Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{6} \text{ and } \boxed{-1}
$$

### **(c) $ \gcd(119, 272) = 119x + 272y $**

**Step 1:**  
$$
272 = 119 \cdot 2 + 34
$$  
$$
119 = 34 \cdot 3 + 17
$$  
$$
34 = 17 \cdot 2 + 0
$$  
So, $ \gcd(119, 272) = 17 $

**Step 2:**  
Back-substitute:
$$
17 = 119 - 34 \cdot 3
$$  
$$
34 = 272 - 119 \cdot 2
$$  
$$
17 = 119 - (272 - 119 \cdot 2) \cdot 3 = 7 \cdot 119 - 3 \cdot 272
$$

**Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{7} \text{ and } \boxed{-3}
$$

### **(d) $ \gcd(1769, 2378) = 1769x + 2378y $**

**Step 1:**  
$$
2378 = 1769 \cdot 1 + 609
$$  
$$
1769 = 609 \cdot 2 + 551
$$  
$$
609 = 551 \cdot 1 + 58
$$  
$$
551 = 58 \cdot 9 + 29
$$  
$$
58 = 29 \cdot 2 + 0
$$  
So, $ \gcd(1769, 2378) = 29 $

**Step 2:**  
Back-substitute:
$$
29 = 551 - 58 \cdot 9
$$  
$$
58 = 609 - 551
$$  
$$
29 = 551 - (609 - 551) \cdot 9 = 10 \cdot 551 - 9 \cdot 609
$$  
$$
551 = 1769 - 609 \cdot 2
$$  
$$
29 = 10 \cdot (1769 - 609 \cdot 2) - 9 \cdot 609 = 10 \cdot 1769 - 29 \cdot 609
$$  
$$
609 = 2378 - 1769
$$  
$$
29 = 10 \cdot 1769 - 29 \cdot (2378 - 1769) = 39 \cdot 1769 - 29 \cdot 2378
$$

**Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{39} \text{ and } \boxed{-29}
$$
