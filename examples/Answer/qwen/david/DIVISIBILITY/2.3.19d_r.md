Okay, so I need to prove that if an integer a is not divisible by 2 or 3, then 24 divides (a² + 23). Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. 

First, the statement says that a is an integer not divisible by 2 or 3. So that means a is an integer that's coprime with 6, right? Because 2 and 3 are prime numbers, so if a isn't divisible by either, then it's coprime with 6. But maybe I don't need to think about coprimality here. Let me just note that a is odd (since not divisible by 2) and not a multiple of 3. 

The conclusion is that 24 divides a² + 23. So, 24 divides (a² + 23) means that when you divide a² + 23 by 24, there's no remainder. Which is equivalent to saying that a² + 23 is congruent to 0 modulo 24. So, a² ≡ -23 mod 24. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of modulo 2 and modulo 3 first, since 24 is 8*3, but wait, 24 is 2^3 * 3. Hmm, maybe I should check divisibility by 8 and 3? Wait, but 24 is 8*3, but since 8 and 3 are coprime, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, if something is divisible by 8 and 3, then it's divisible by 24. So maybe I can check that a² + 23 is divisible by 8 and by 3. If I can show that, then it's divisible by 24. 

Alternatively, maybe I can check divisibility by 24 directly. But since 24 is a composite number, breaking it down into prime factors might be easier. Let me try that approach. 

So, first, check divisibility by 3. Let's see, since a is not divisible by 3, then a mod 3 can be 1 or 2. Let me compute a² mod 3. 

If a ≡ 1 mod 3, then a² ≡ 1² ≡ 1 mod 3. Then a² + 23 ≡ 1 + 23 mod 3. 23 divided by 3 is 7*3=21, so 23 ≡ 2 mod 3. Therefore, 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. 

If a ≡ 2 mod 3, then a² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Then again, a² + 23 ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. 

So regardless of whether a is 1 or 2 mod 3, a² + 23 is 0 mod 3. So that takes care of divisibility by 3. 

Now, check divisibility by 8. Since 24 is 8*3, and we already have divisibility by 3, we need to check divisibility by 8. 

But first, since a is not divisible by 2, so a is odd. Therefore, a is congruent to 1, 3, 5, or 7 mod 8. Let me compute a² mod 8 for these cases. 

If a ≡ 1 mod 8, then a² ≡ 1 mod 8. Then a² + 23 ≡ 1 + 23 mod 8. 23 divided by 8 is 2*8=16, so 23 ≡ 7 mod 8. Therefore, 1 + 7 = 8 ≡ 0 mod 8. 

If a ≡ 3 mod 8, then a² = 9 ≡ 1 mod 8. Then again, a² + 23 ≡ 1 + 7 = 8 ≡ 0 mod 8. 

Similarly, if a ≡ 5 mod 8, then a² = 25 ≡ 1 mod 8. Again, same result: 1 + 7 = 8 ≡ 0 mod 8. 

If a ≡ 7 mod 8, then a² = 49 ≡ 1 mod 8. Again, same thing: 1 + 7 = 8 ≡ 0 mod 8. 

So regardless of which odd residue a is mod 8, a² ≡ 1 mod 8, so a² + 23 ≡ 1 + 7 = 8 ≡ 0 mod 8. Therefore, a² + 23 is divisible by 8. 

Therefore, since a² + 23 is divisible by both 3 and 8, and since 3 and 8 are coprime, it is divisible by 24. Hence, 24 divides a² + 23. 

Wait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using modular arithmetic directly. Let me think. 

Alternatively, since a is not divisible by 2 or 3, then a is coprime to 6, so by Euler's theorem, a^φ(6) ≡ 1 mod 6. But φ(6) is 2, so a² ≡ 1 mod 6. Therefore, a² + 23 ≡ 1 + 23 mod 6. 23 mod 6 is 5, so 1 + 5 = 6 ≡ 0 mod 6. So that shows divisibility by 6. But we need divisibility by 24, so maybe this is not sufficient. 

But perhaps I can use higher exponents. For example, since 24 is 8*3, maybe I need to check modulo 8 and modulo 3. Which is what I did earlier. 

Alternatively, maybe I can check modulo 24 directly. Let me try that. 

Since a is not divisible by 2 or 3, then a is odd and not a multiple of 3. So possible residues mod 24? Well, there are 24 residues, but since a is not divisible by 2 or 3, the possible residues are numbers coprime to 6, which are numbers not divisible by 2 or 3. So numbers like 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 mod 24. 

So maybe I can check for each of these residues, compute a² + 23 mod 24 and see if it's 0. 

Let me try:

For a ≡ 1 mod 24: a² = 1, so 1 + 23 = 24 ≡ 0 mod 24. 

a ≡ 5 mod 24: 5² = 25, 25 + 23 = 48 ≡ 0 mod 24. 

a ≡ 7 mod 24: 7² = 49, 49 + 23 = 72 ≡ 0 mod 24. 

a ≡ 11 mod 24: 11² = 121, 121 + 23 = 144. 144 / 24 = 6, so 0 mod 24. 

a ≡ 13 mod 24: 13² = 169, 169 + 23 = 192. 192 / 24 = 8, so 0 mod 24. 

a ≡ 17 mod 24: 17² = 289, 289 + 23 = 312. 312 / 24 = 13, so 0 mod 24. 

a ≡ 19 mod 24: 19² = 361, 361 + 23 = 384. 384 / 24 = 16, so 0 mod 24. 

a ≡ 23 mod 24: 23² = 529, 529 + 23 = 552. 552 / 24 = 23, so 0 mod 24. 

So all these residues give 0 mod 24. Therefore, for any a not divisible by 2 or 3, a² + 23 is divisible by 24. 

But maybe this is more of a brute force approach. However, since there are only 8 residues mod 24 that are coprime to 6, checking them all is manageable. However, maybe there's a more general way. 

Alternatively, since we already showed that a² + 23 is divisible by 3 and 8, then since 3 and 8 are coprime, it's divisible by 24. 

But let me check if that logic is correct. If a number is divisible by 3 and 8, then it's divisible by LCM(3,8)=24. Yes, because 3 and 8 are coprime. Therefore, if a number is divisible by both, then it's divisible by their product. Therefore, since we showed that a² + 23 is divisible by 3 and 8, then it is divisible by 24. 

Therefore, the assertion holds. 

But let me just check if there's any possible mistake in my reasoning. 

First, for divisibility by 3: since a is not divisible by 3, then a ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3. Then a² ≡ 1 mod 3, so a² + 23 ≡ 1 + 23 mod 3. 23 mod 3 is 2, so 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Correct. 

For divisibility by 8: since a is odd, so a ≡ 1, 3, 5, 7 mod 8. Then a² ≡ 1 mod 8 in all cases. Because 1²=1, 3²=9≡1, 5²=25≡1, 7²=49≡1 mod 8. Therefore, a² ≡1 mod 8. Then a² + 23 ≡1 + 23 mod 8. 23 mod 8 is 7, so 1 + 7 = 8 ≡ 0 mod 8. Correct. 

Therefore, since 3 and 8 are coprime, then 24 divides a² + 23. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of congruences. Let me try to write a² + 23 ≡ 0 mod 24. Which is equivalent to a² ≡ -23 mod 24. But -23 mod 24 is 1, because 24 - 23 = 1. Therefore, a² ≡ 1 mod 24. 

But if a is not divisible by 2 or 3, then a is coprime to 24, so by Euler's theorem, a^φ(24) ≡ 1 mod 24. φ(24) is φ(8*3) = φ(8)*φ(3) = 4*2 = 8. So a^8 ≡ 1 mod 24. But does that help? Maybe not directly. However, if we can show that a² ≡ 1 mod 24, then that would be sufficient. 

But why would a² ≡ 1 mod 24? Well, since a is odd, a² ≡ 1 mod 8, as we saw. And since a is not divisible by 3, then a² ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, since 8 and 3 are coprime, there is a unique solution mod 24. So if a² ≡ 1 mod 8 and a² ≡ 1 mod 3, then a² ≡ 1 mod 24. 

Therefore, a² ≡ 1 mod 24. Therefore, a² + 23 ≡ 1 + 23 ≡ 24 ≡ 0 mod 24. 

Yes, that's another way to see it. So, if we can show that a² ≡ 1 mod 24, then adding 23 gives 0 mod 24. 

But how do we know that a² ≡ 1 mod 24? Well, since a is odd, we know that a² ≡ 1 mod 8. And since a is not divisible by 3, then a² ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, combining these two congruences, we can use Chinese Remainder Theorem to say that a² ≡ 1 mod 24. 

Therefore, that's another way to see it. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if a is odd, then a is 1 or -1 mod 4, so a² is 1 mod 4. But 24 is 8*3, so maybe I need to check mod 8 and mod 3. 

But regardless, the key steps are:

1. Show that a² + 23 is divisible by 3.

2. Show that a² + 23 is divisible by 8.

Since 3 and 8 are coprime, then it's divisible by 24. 

Alternatively, since a² ≡ 1 mod 8 and mod 3, so a² ≡ 1 mod 24. 

Therefore, a² + 23 ≡ 1 + 23 = 24 ≡ 0 mod 24. 

So, all these approaches lead to the same conclusion. 

But let me check with an example. Let me take a = 1. Then a² + 23 = 1 + 23 = 24, which is divisible by 24. 

Take a = 5. 5² + 23 = 25 + 23 = 48, which is 2*24. 

Take a = 7. 7² + 23 = 49 + 23 = 72, which is 3*24. 

Take a = 11. 121 + 23 = 144, which is 6*24. 

Take a = 13. 169 + 23 = 192, which is 8*24. 

Take a = 17. 289 + 23 = 312, which is 13*24. 

Take a = 19. 361 + 23 = 384, which is 16*24. 

Take a = 23. 529 + 23 = 552, which is 23*24. 

All these examples check out. 

Another example, take a = 7. Wait, already did that. How about a = -1? Well, -1 mod 24 is 23, which we checked. 

Another example, a = 5 mod 24. 

Alternatively, take a = 7 mod 24. 

So, seems like all these examples work. 

Therefore, the assertion is correct. 

But let me check a case where a is not coprime to 6, just to make sure that the condition is correct. For example, take a = 2. Then a is divisible by 2, so it's excluded. Similarly, a = 3 is excluded. Let's take a = 4. Divisible by 2. Not allowed. a = 6, divisible by 2 and 3. Not allowed. 

So, the examples where a is not divisible by 2 or 3 are the ones we checked. 

Therefore, I think the reasoning is solid. 

So, the conclusion is that if a is not divisible by 2 or 3, then 24 divides a² + 23. 

Therefore, the assertion is established.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{24}
</think>

To prove that if an integer $ a $ is not divisible by 2 or 3, then $ 24 \mid (a^2 + 23) $, we proceed by analyzing the divisibility of $ a^2 + 23 $ by 3 and 8, since $ 24 = 3 \times 8 $, and 3 and 8 are coprime.

---

### Step 1: Divisibility by 3

Since $ a $ is **not divisible by 3**, we have:
$$
a \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \quad \text{or} \quad a \equiv 2 \pmod{3}
$$

- If $ a \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $, then $ a^2 \equiv 1^2 = 1 \pmod{3} $, and $ a^2 + 23 \equiv 1 + 23 = 24 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $.
- If $ a \equiv 2 \pmod{3} $, then $ a^2 \equiv 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $, and again $ a^2 + 23 \equiv 1 + 23 = 24 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $.

So, in both cases, $ a^2 + 23 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $, which means $ a^2 + 23 $ is divisible by 3.

---

### Step 2: Divisibility by 8

Since $ a $ is **not divisible by 2**, it is **odd**, and thus $ a \equiv 1, 3, 5, 7 \pmod{8} $. For each of these residues, we compute $ a^2 \mod 8 $:

- $ 1^2 = 1 \mod 8 $
- $ 3^2 = 9 \equiv 1 \mod 8 $
- $ 5^2 = 25 \equiv 1 \mod 8 $
- $ 7^2 = 49 \equiv 1 \mod 8 $

So, in all cases, $ a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} $, and therefore:
$$
a^2 + 23 \equiv 1 + 23 = 24 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}
$$

Hence, $ a^2 + 23 $ is divisible by 8.

---

### Step 3: Combining the Results

We now know that:
$$
a^2 + 23 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \quad \text{and} \quad a^2 + 23 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}
$$

Since 3 and 8 are coprime, by the **Chinese Remainder Theorem**, this implies:
$$
a^2 + 23 \equiv 0 \pmod{24}
$$

Thus, $ 24 \mid (a^2 + 23) $.

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{24}
