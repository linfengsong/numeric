Okay, so I need to verify these four statements about divisibility. Let me take them one by one. First, let me recall what divisibility means. If a | b, that means there exists some integer k such that b = a*k. Similarly for other divisibility statements.

Starting with part (a): If a divides b, then a divides bc. So, given that a | b, we need to show that a | bc. Let me think. If a divides b, then b is a multiple of a. So, let me write b as a*k for some integer k. Then bc would be a*k*c. Therefore, bc is a multiplied by k*c. Since k*c is an integer (because k and c are integers), that means bc is a multiple of a. Therefore, a divides bc. That seems straightforward. So part (a) is true.

Moving on to part (b): If a divides b and a divides c, then a squared divides bc. So, given that a | b and a | c, we need to show that a² divides bc. Let me try to write this out. If a divides b, then b = a*m for some integer m. Similarly, since a divides c, c = a*n for some integer n. Then bc would be (a*m)*(a*n) = a²*m*n. Therefore, bc is a² multiplied by m*n, which is an integer. Therefore, a² divides bc. So that's true. Therefore, part (b) is correct.

Part (c): a divides b if and only if ac divides bc, where c is not zero. So, this is a biconditional statement. So, we need to prove both directions. First, if a divides b, then ac divides bc. And also, if ac divides bc, then a divides b. Let me check both directions.

First direction: If a | b, then ac | bc. Well, if a divides b, then b = a*k for some integer k. Then bc = a*k*c. So, ac divides bc because bc = a*c*k. Therefore, ac divides bc. That's straightforward.

Now the other direction: If ac divides bc, then a divides b. So, suppose that ac divides bc. That means there exists some integer m such that bc = ac*m. Let me rearrange this equation. Dividing both sides by c (since c ≠ 0, we can do that). Then b = a*m. Therefore, a divides b. So that's the other direction. Therefore, the biconditional holds. So part (c) is true.

Part (d): If a divides b and c divides d, then ac divides bd. Let me check this. So, given a | b and c | d, so b = a*k and d = c*m for some integers k and m. Then bd = (a*k)*(c*m) = a*c*k*m. Therefore, bd is equal to ac multiplied by k*m. Therefore, ac divides bd. Therefore, part (d) is true.

Now, moving on to problem 3: Prove or disprove that if a divides (b + c), then either a divides b or a divides c. Hmm. Let me think. This seems like a common misconception. Let me try to find a counterexample. Suppose a = 2, b = 1, c = 1. Then b + c = 2, and 2 divides 2. But 2 does not divide 1 or 1. Therefore, this is a counterexample. Therefore, the statement is false. Therefore, the answer is that it's false.

Wait, but let me check another example. Let me think again. Suppose a divides b + c. So, for example, a = 3, b = 1, c = 2. Then b + c = 3, which is divisible by 3. But 3 doesn't divide 1 or 2. So again, counterexample. Therefore, the statement is false. Therefore, the answer is that it's false.

Alternatively, maybe there are some cases where it's true. For example, if a divides b, then obviously a divides b + c if a divides c. But the statement says "either a divides b or a divides c", but it's not necessarily true. Therefore, the statement is false.

So, to summarize:

(a) True.

(b) True.

(c) True.

(d) True.

Problem 3: False.

But let me check part (d) again. Suppose a divides b and c divides d. Then ac divides bd? Let me take specific numbers. Let a = 2, b = 4, c = 3, d = 6. Then ac = 6, bd = 4*6 = 24. 6 divides 24, yes. Another example: a = 2, b = 2, c = 3, d = 3. Then ac = 6, bd = 6. 6 divides 6. True. Another example: a = 2, b = 6, c = 3, d = 9. Then ac = 6, bd = 6*9 = 54. 6 divides 54. Yes. So seems like part (d) is true.

But let me think of a case where maybe it's not. Suppose a = 2, b = 2, c = 2, d = 2. Then ac = 4, bd = 4. 4 divides 4. True. What if a = 2, b = 4, c = 2, d = 6. Then ac = 4, bd = 4*6 = 24. 4 divides 24. Yes. Maybe another case where a divides b and c divides d, but ac doesn't divide bd? Let me think. Let me take a = 2, b = 4 (so 2 divides 4), c = 3, d = 6 (so 3 divides 6). Then ac = 6, bd = 4*6 = 24. 6 divides 24. Yes. How about a = 2, b = 2, c = 4, d = 8. Then ac = 8, bd = 2*8 = 16. 8 divides 16. Yes. Hmm. Maybe it's always true. So, since b = a*k and d = c*m, then bd = a*c*k*m, so ac divides bd. Therefore, yes, part (d) is true.

Therefore, my conclusion is that all parts (a)-(d) are true, and problem 3 is false.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{True}

(b) \boxed{True}

(c) \boxed{True}

(d) \boxed{True}

3. \boxed{False}

### **Verification of Statements**

#### **(a) If $ a \mid b $, then $ a \mid bc $**

- Given $ a \mid b $, there exists an integer $ k $ such that $ b = a \cdot k $.
- Then $ bc = (a \cdot k) \cdot c = a \cdot (k \cdot c) $.
- Since $ k \cdot c $ is an integer, $ bc $ is a multiple of $ a $, so $ a \mid bc $.

✅ **True**

---

#### **(b) If $ a \mid b $ and $ a \mid c $, then $ a^2 \mid bc $**

- From $ a \mid b $, we get $ b = a \cdot m $ for some integer $ m $.
- From $ a \mid c $, we get $ c = a \cdot n $ for some integer $ n $.
- Then $ bc = (a \cdot m)(a \cdot n) = a^2 \cdot (m \cdot n) $.
- Since $ m \cdot n $ is an integer, $ bc $ is a multiple of $ a^2 $, so $ a^2 \mid bc $.

✅ **True**

---

#### **(c) $ a \mid b $ if and only if $ ac \mid bc $, where $ c \neq 0 $**

- **Forward direction**: If $ a \mid b $, then $ b = a \cdot k $, so $ bc = a \cdot k \cdot c = ac \cdot k $, hence $ ac \mid bc $.
- **Reverse direction**: If $ ac \mid bc $, then $ bc = ac \cdot m $ for some integer $ m $, so dividing both sides by $ c $ (since $ c \neq 0 $), we get $ b = a \cdot m $, hence $ a \mid b $.

✅ **True**

---

#### **(d) If $ a \mid b $ and $ c \mid d $, then $ ac \mid bd $**

- From $ a \mid b $, we get $ b = a \cdot k $.
- From $ c \mid d $, we get $ d = c \cdot m $.
- Then $ bd = (a \cdot k)(c \cdot m) = ac \cdot (k \cdot m) $.
- Since $ k \cdot m $ is an integer, $ bd $ is a multiple of $ ac $, so $ ac \mid bd $.

✅ **True**

---

### **Problem 3: Prove or disprove: If $ a \mid (b + c) $, then either $ a \mid b $ or $ a \mid c $**

This is a classic counterexample problem.

- **Counterexample**: Let $ a = 2 $, $ b = 1 $, $ c = 1 $. Then $ b + c = 2 $, and $ 2 \mid 2 $, but $ 2 \nmid 1 $ and $ 2 \nmid 1 $.
- Therefore, the statement is **false**.

❌ **False**
