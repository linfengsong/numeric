Okay, so I need to prove that for any integer a, 6 divides a(a² + 11). Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that if a number is divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3, since 6 is 2 times 3 and they are prime. So maybe I can show that a(a² + 11) is divisible by 2 and by 3 separately. That seems like a plan.

Let me start with divisibility by 2. So, for any integer a, either a is even or a is odd. If a is even, then a is divisible by 2, so the whole expression a(a² + 11) is definitely divisible by 2. If a is odd, then a² is also odd because odd times odd is odd. Then 11 is odd, so odd plus odd is even. Therefore, a² + 11 is even. So even if a is odd, the term (a² + 11) is even, so the entire expression is odd times even, which is even. Therefore, regardless of whether a is even or odd, the product is divisible by 2. So that takes care of the divisibility by 2.

Now, moving on to divisibility by 3. This part might be trickier. Let me think. For any integer a, when divided by 3, the remainder can be 0, 1, or 2. So maybe I can consider these three cases.

Case 1: a is divisible by 3. Then a = 3k for some integer k. Then a(a² + 11) = 3k*( (3k)^2 + 11 ) = 3k*(9k² + 11). Clearly, this is divisible by 3.

Case 2: a ≡ 1 mod 3. So a = 3k + 1. Let me compute a² + 11. First, a² = (3k + 1)^2 = 9k² + 6k + 1. Then adding 11 gives 9k² + 6k + 1 + 11 = 9k² + 6k + 12. Now, let's factor this: 9k² + 6k + 12. Let me check if this is divisible by 3. Each term is divisible by 3: 9k² is 3*(3k²), 6k is 3*(2k), and 12 is 3*4. So yes, the entire expression is divisible by 3. Therefore, a² + 11 is divisible by 3, so the whole product a(a² + 11) is divisible by 3.

Case 3: a ≡ 2 mod 3. So a = 3k + 2. Then a² = (3k + 2)^2 = 9k² + 12k + 4. Adding 11 gives 9k² + 12k + 4 + 11 = 9k² + 12k + 15. Again, check divisibility by 3. Each term is divisible by 3: 9k² is 3*(3k²), 12k is 3*(4k), and 15 is 3*5. Therefore, the entire expression is divisible by 3, so again, a² + 11 is divisible by 3, making the product divisible by 3.

So in all three cases, the expression is divisible by 3. Therefore, since it is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6. Therefore, 6 divides a(a² + 11) for any integer a.

Wait, but let me check with some examples to make sure. Let me take a = 1. Then 1*(1 + 11) = 1*12 = 12, which is divisible by 6. Okay. a = 2: 2*(4 + 11) = 2*15 = 30, which is divisible by 6. a = 3: 3*(9 + 11) = 3*20 = 60, which is divisible by 6. a = 0: 0*(0 + 11) = 0, which is divisible by 6. a = -1: (-1)*(1 + 11) = -12, which is divisible by 6. a = 4: 4*(16 + 11) = 4*27 = 108, which is divisible by 6. Okay, seems like all these examples work. So maybe my reasoning is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Let me think. Maybe using modular arithmetic. Let me try that.

We need to show that a(a² + 11) ≡ 0 mod 6. Which is equivalent to showing that a(a² + 11) ≡ 0 mod 2 and mod 3.

But I already did that. Alternatively, maybe factor the expression. Let me see. Let me compute a³ + 11a. So, the expression is a³ + 11a. Maybe factor that? a³ + 11a = a(a² + 11). Hmm. Not sure if that helps. Maybe try to see if this is divisible by 6.

Alternatively, think about modulo 6. Let me check for all residues mod 6. Since a can be 0,1,2,3,4,5 mod 6. Let me check each case:

Case 0: a ≡ 0 mod 6. Then the expression is 0*(something) = 0 mod 6. Good.

Case 1: a ≡ 1 mod 6. Then compute 1³ + 11*1 = 1 + 11 = 12 ≡ 0 mod 6. Good.

Case 2: a ≡ 2 mod 6. Then 8 + 22 = 30 ≡ 0 mod 6. Good.

Case 3: a ≡ 3 mod 6. Then 27 + 33 = 60 ≡ 0 mod 6. Good.

Case 4: a ≡ 4 mod 6. Then 64 + 44 = 108 ≡ 0 mod 6. Good.

Case 5: a ≡ 5 mod 6. Then 125 + 55 = 180 ≡ 0 mod 6. Good.

So, in all cases, the expression is 0 mod 6. Therefore, this proves that 6 divides a(a² + 11) for any integer a. So that's another way to see it. So both methods confirm the same thing.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the fact that 6 divides the expression if it's divisible by 2 and 3. Which is what I did first. So, both approaches work.

But maybe there's another way. Let me think. For example, maybe using the fact that a³ - a is divisible by 6 for any integer a. Wait, that's a known result. Because a³ - a = a(a² - 1) = a(a - 1)(a + 1), which is three consecutive integers, so divisible by 2 and 3. But our expression is a³ + 11a. Let me see if I can relate this to a³ - a.

a³ + 11a = a³ - a + 12a. So, a³ - a is divisible by 6, and 12a is obviously divisible by 6. Therefore, their sum is also divisible by 6. Therefore, a³ + 11a is divisible by 6. Therefore, this is another way to see it. That's clever. So, since a³ - a is divisible by 6, and 12a is divisible by 6, then adding them gives something divisible by 6. Therefore, the original expression is divisible by 6. That's a nice approach.

So that's another way to look at it. So, maybe that's a more concise way. But regardless, all the methods lead to the same conclusion.

Therefore, the assertion is proven.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{6}

To prove that $ 6 \mid a(a^2 + 11) $ for any integer $ a $, we aim to show that the expression is divisible by both 2 and 3, since 6 is the product of these two primes and they are coprime.

### **Step 1: Divisibility by 2**

We consider the two cases based on whether $ a $ is even or odd:

- **Case 1: $ a $ is even**  
  If $ a $ is even, then $ a $ is divisible by 2. Hence, the entire expression $ a(a^2 + 11) $ is divisible by 2.

- **Case 2: $ a $ is odd**  
  If $ a $ is odd, then $ a^2 $ is also odd (odd × odd = odd). Since 11 is odd, $ a^2 + 11 $ is even (odd + odd = even). Therefore, $ a(a^2 + 11) $ is odd × even = even, which is divisible by 2.

Thus, in both cases, the expression is divisible by 2.

### **Step 2: Divisibility by 3**

We analyze the expression modulo 3. The possible residues of $ a \mod 3 $ are 0, 1, or 2. We examine each case:

- **Case 1: $ a \equiv 0 \mod 3 $**  
  Then $ a $ is divisible by 3, so the entire expression $ a(a^2 + 11) $ is divisible by 3.

- **Case 2: $ a \equiv 1 \mod 3 $**  
  Then $ a^2 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $, and $ a^2 + 11 \equiv 1 + 11 = 12 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $. So the expression is divisible by 3.

- **Case 3: $ a \equiv 2 \mod 3 $**  
  Then $ a^2 \equiv 4 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $, and $ a^2 + 11 \equiv 1 + 11 = 12 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $. Again, the expression is divisible by 3.

In all cases, the expression is divisible by 3.

### **Conclusion**

Since the expression $ a(a^2 + 11) $ is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by their least common multiple, which is 6. Therefore, we conclude:
