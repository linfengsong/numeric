Okay, so I need to show that if a divides b (a | b), then (-a) also divides b, a divides (-b), and (-a) divides (-b). Let me start by recalling what it means for one integer to divide another. 

If a divides b, written as a | b, that means there exists some integer k such that b = a * k. Right? So, for example, if a is 2 and b is 6, then 2 divides 6 because 6 = 2 * 3. 

Now, the problem is about negative numbers. Let me think. If a divides b, then I need to show that -a also divides b. Let me try to use the definition. If -a divides b, then there must be some integer m such that b = (-a) * m. Let me see if that's true given that a divides b.

Since a divides b, there is an integer k such that b = a * k. Let me substitute that into the equation for -a dividing b. If b = a * k, then can I write that as (-a) * m? Let me see. If I factor out a negative sign from the left side, (-a) * m = -a * m. So, if I set -a * m equal to a * k, then:

-a * m = a * k

Divide both sides by a (assuming a is not zero, which I think is a safe assumption here because division by zero is undefined, and if a was zero, then the divisibility would be trivial, but maybe the problem assumes a and b are non-zero? Wait, actually, if a is zero, then 0 divides b only if b is also zero, but I think in standard definitions, 0 divides only 0. But maybe the problem is considering a and b as non-zero integers. Hmm. Well, maybe I should proceed assuming a ≠ 0, since otherwise the problem might not make much sense. 

So, assuming a ≠ 0, then dividing both sides by a gives:

- m = k => m = -k

Therefore, since k is an integer, m is also an integer. Therefore, b = (-a) * m, which means that -a divides b. Therefore, (-a) | b. So that's the first part. 

Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, moving on to the second part: a divides (-b). So, similarly, if a divides b, then there exists an integer k such that b = a * k. Then, -b would be -a * k. Therefore, -b = a * (-k). Since k is an integer, -k is also an integer. Therefore, a divides -b. So that's the second part. 

Similarly, for the third part: (-a) divides (-b). Let me think. If (-a) divides (-b), then there must be some integer m such that -b = (-a) * m. Let me see. Since a divides b, we have b = a * k. Then, -b = -a * k. So, if I write that as (-a) * m, then:

(-a) * m = -a * k => m = k. Therefore, since k is an integer, m is also an integer. Therefore, -b = (-a) * m, so (-a) divides (-b). 

Therefore, all three statements hold. 

Wait, let me check if I did that correctly. For the third part, starting from (-a) divides (-b). So, if we have -b = (-a) * m. Then, since b = a * k, then -b = -a * k. Therefore, -a * k = (-a) * m. Therefore, m = k. So yes, that's correct. 

But let me think again. Maybe there's another way to approach it. Since divisibility is related to factors. If a divides b, then the divisors of b include a, -a, and so on. So, if a divides b, then multiplying both sides by -1, we get that -a divides -b? Wait, but that seems like maybe a different approach. 

Alternatively, since divisibility is preserved under multiplication by units. In integers, the units are 1 and -1. So, if a divides b, then multiplying both sides by -1, we get that (-1)*a divides (-1)*b. Which would be -a divides -b. But that's another way to think about it. 

But maybe I need to be more careful. Let me recall that if a divides b, then there exists an integer k such that b = a * k. Then, multiplying both sides by -1, we get -b = -a * k. Therefore, -b is equal to (-a) multiplied by k. Therefore, (-a) divides -b. 

But that's exactly the third part. So that's another way to see it. 

Alternatively, for the second part, a divides -b. Since b = a * k, then -b = -a * k, which is a multiplied by -k, so since -k is an integer, a divides -b. 

So, all three statements follow from the definition. 

But let me check with an example. Let's take a = 2, b = 6. Then, a divides b. Now, -a is -2. Does -2 divide 6? Yes, because 6 = (-2) * (-3). So that's good. Then, a divides -b: -b is -6, and 2 divides -6 because -6 = 2 * (-3). And (-a) divides (-b): -a is -2, and -b is -6. So, -6 = (-2) * 3. So that works. 

Another example: a = 3, b = 9. Then -a = -3. -3 divides 9? Yes, 9 = (-3) * (-3). a divides -b: -b is -9, and 3 divides -9 because -9 = 3 * (-3). (-a) divides (-b): -3 divides -9, which is true because -9 = (-3) * 3. 

Another example with negative numbers. Let me take a = -2, b = 4. Then, a divides b? Well, -2 divides 4 because 4 = (-2) * (-2). Then, (-a) is 2. Does 2 divide 4? Yes. a divides -b: -b is -4. -2 divides -4? Yes, because -4 = (-2) * 2. (-a) divides (-b): 2 divides -4? Yes, because -4 = 2 * (-2). 

So in all these examples, the statements hold. 

But maybe I need to think about the general case. Let me try to formalize it again. 

Given that a | b, so there exists integer k such that b = a * k. 

Then, for (-a) | b: we need to find integer m such that b = (-a) * m. From above, since b = a * k, then we can write b = (-a) * (-k). Therefore, m = -k, which is integer. Therefore, (-a) divides b. 

Similarly, for a | (-b): -b = -a * k, so that's a * (-k), so yes, a divides -b. 

For (-a) | (-b): -b = (-a) * k, which is same as above. So, since -b = (-a) * k, then (-a) divides -b. 

Therefore, all three statements hold. 

Is there any case where this might not hold? Suppose a is zero? Well, if a is zero, then the divisibility is only defined if b is also zero. Because 0 divides 0? Wait, actually, in mathematics, 0 divides 0 is a bit of a tricky case. But generally, the definition is that a divides b if there exists an integer k such that b = a * k. If a is zero, then b = 0 * k = 0 for any k. Therefore, the only integer b that is divisible by 0 is 0. However, in that case, the divisibility is only defined for b = 0. But if a is zero and b is zero, then we have 0 divides 0. But then, (-a) is also zero. So, (-a) divides b would be 0 divides 0, which is true. Similarly, a divides -b would be 0 divides 0, which is true. And (-a) divides (-b) is also 0 divides 0. So, in that case, it still holds. However, usually, when talking about divisibility, we consider a and b to be non-zero. But since the problem didn't specify, maybe we need to consider that case as well. However, since the problem says "a | b", and if a is zero, then b must be zero, and then all the other statements would also hold. 

But maybe the problem is assuming that a and b are non-zero integers. But regardless, the logic holds. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a more formal way to write this using the definition. 

So, to recap:

Given a | b, so there exists integer k with b = a*k.

Then:

1. (-a) | b: We need to show that there exists integer m such that b = (-a)*m. From above, b = a*k = (-a)*(-k). Therefore, m = -k is integer. Hence, (-a) divides b.

2. a | (-b): We need to show that there exists integer n such that -b = a*n. From above, since b = a*k, then -b = -a*k = a*(-k). Therefore, n = -k is integer. Hence, a divides -b.

3. (-a) | (-b): We need to show that there exists integer p such that -b = (-a)*p. From above, -b = -a*k = (-a)*k. Therefore, p = k is integer. Hence, (-a) divides -b.

Therefore, all three statements are proven.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the property that if a divides b, then a divides -b, and also that a divides -b if and only if a divides b. But that might be more of a property rather than a direct proof. 

But since the problem is to show that (-a) divides b, etc., using the definition, the above approach is sufficient.

Another way to think about it is that divisibility is preserved under multiplication by units. In the integers, the units are 1 and -1. So, if a divides b, then multiplying both sides by -1, we get that (-1)*a divides (-1)*b, which is -a divides -b. But that's another way to see the third part. Similarly, since a divides b, then multiplying both sides by -1, we get that -a divides -b. But that's the third part. However, for the first part, (-a) divides b. How does that relate? Well, if a divides b, then multiplying both sides by -1, we get that -a divides -b, but how does that relate to (-a) dividing b?

Wait, maybe that approach is not directly helpful for the first part. But perhaps if we think that if a divides b, then -a divides b because multiplying both sides by -1, but that might not be directly applicable. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. 

If a divides b, then there is an integer k such that b = a*k. Then, if we want to show that -a divides b, then we need to have b = (-a)*m. Which would mean that m = -k. Therefore, since k is integer, m is integer. So that's the same as before. 

Alternatively, if we think of divisibility in terms of absolute values. If a divides b, then |a| divides |b|. But that's not exactly the same. However, if a divides b, then -a divides b because the divisors of b include both a and -a. But that's more of a property. 

But in any case, the direct approach using the definition seems to work. 

So, I think that's all. The key is that if a divides b, then you can write b as a multiple of a, and then by adjusting the sign of the multiplier, you can express b as a multiple of -a, or -b as a multiple of a, etc. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that all three statements hold.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{(-a) \mid b}, \boxed{a \mid (-b)}, and \boxed{(-a) \mid (-b)}
</think>

To show that if $ a \mid b $, then $ (-a) \mid b $, $ a \mid (-b) $, and $ (-a) \mid (-b) $, we begin by recalling the definition of divisibility in the context of integers:

> If $ a \mid b $, then there exists some integer $ k $ such that $ b = a \cdot k $.

---

### 1. **Show that $ (-a) \mid b $**

We are given that $ a \mid b $, so there exists an integer $ k $ such that:

$$
b = a \cdot k
$$

We want to show that $ (-a) \mid b $, which means we need an integer $ m $ such that:

$$
b = (-a) \cdot m
$$

From the above, we can write:

$$
b = a \cdot k = (-a) \cdot (-k)
$$

So, if we let $ m = -k $, then:

$$
b = (-a) \cdot m
$$

Since $ k $ is an integer, so is $ m $, hence $ (-a) \mid b $.

---

### 2. **Show that $ a \mid (-b) $**

Again, starting from the given $ a \mid b $, we have $ b = a \cdot k $. Then:

$$
-b = -a \cdot k = a \cdot (-k)
$$

This shows that $ -b = a \cdot (-k) $, and since $ -k $ is an integer, it follows that:

$$
a \mid (-b)
$$

---

### 3. **Show that $ (-a) \mid (-b) $**

From the previous step, we have:

$$
-b = -a \cdot k
$$

So:

$$
-b = (-a) \cdot k
$$

This shows that $ -b = (-a) \cdot k $, and since $ k $ is an integer, it follows that:

$$
(-a) \mid (-b)
$$

---

### Conclusion

By applying the definition of divisibility and manipulating the expressions accordingly, we have shown that:

- $ (-a) \mid b $
- $ a \mid (-b) $
- $ (-a) \mid (-b) $

All three statements follow directly from the original divisibility condition $ a \mid b $.

---

**Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{(-a) \mid b}, \quad \boxed{a \mid (-b)}, \quad \boxed{(-a) \mid (-b)}
$$
