Okay, so I need to show that any integer that's of the form 6k + 5 is also of the form 3j + 2, but that the reverse isn't true. Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking.

First, let me recall what it means for a number to be of a certain form. If a number is of the form 6k + 5, that means when you divide it by 6, the remainder is 5. Similarly, a number of the form 3j + 2 means when divided by 3, the remainder is 2. So, the problem is saying that numbers that are 5 mod 6 are also 2 mod 3, but numbers that are 2 mod 3 aren't necessarily 5 mod 6. 

Let me start with the first part: showing that 6k + 5 is equivalent to 3j + 2. Maybe I can express 6k + 5 in terms of 3j + 2. Let me try to manipulate the expression 6k + 5. 

Since 6 is 2 times 3, maybe I can write 6k as 3*(2k). So, 6k + 5 = 3*(2k) + 5. Now, if I want this to be in the form 3j + 2, then I need to adjust the 5. Let me think. If I have 3*(2k) + 5, then 5 can be written as 3*1 + 2. So, substituting that in, we get 3*(2k) + 3*1 + 2. Which is 3*(2k + 1) + 2. Therefore, if I let j = 2k + 1, then 6k + 5 = 3j + 2. 

So, that seems to work. Therefore, any number that is 6k + 5 can be written as 3j + 2 where j is 2k + 1. Therefore, the first part is proven. 

But wait, let me check with an example. Let me take k = 0. Then 6*0 + 5 = 5. Now, 5 should be 3j + 2. Let's solve for j: 3j + 2 = 5 => 3j = 3 => j = 1. Which is indeed 2*0 + 1 = 1. So that works. Another example: k = 1. 6*1 + 5 = 11. Then 3j + 2 = 11 => 3j = 9 => j = 3. And 2k + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3. That works too. How about k = -1? 6*(-1) + 5 = -6 + 5 = -1. Then 3j + 2 = -1 => 3j = -3 => j = -1. And 2k + 1 = 2*(-1) + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1. That also works. So seems like the algebra checks out. 

Therefore, the first part is done. Now, the second part: showing that not all numbers of the form 3j + 2 are of the form 6k + 5. So, we need to find a number that is 3j + 2 but not 6k + 5. 

Let me think. Let's take some numbers that are 2 mod 3. For example, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, etc. Now, let's check if they are 5 mod 6. Let's take 2: 2 divided by 6 is 0 with remainder 2. So 2 mod 6 is 2, not 5. Therefore, 2 is 3j + 2 (j=0) but not 6k + 5. Therefore, that's a counterexample. 

Alternatively, let me think algebraically. Suppose we have a number of the form 3j + 2. Let me try to write it as 6k + 5. So, 3j + 2 = 6k + 5. Then, rearranging, 3j - 6k = 3 => j - 2k = 1 => j = 2k + 1. Therefore, if j is 2k + 1, then 3j + 2 is 6k + 5. But if j is not of the form 2k + 1, then it's not of the form 6k + 5. 

But wait, j can be any integer. So, if we take j such that j is not equal to 2k + 1 for any integer k, then 3j + 2 is not 6k + 5. However, j can be any integer. Let me think. For example, if j is even, then j = 2m for some integer m. Then, 3j + 2 = 6m + 2, which is 6m + 2. Which is 2 mod 6. Therefore, numbers of the form 3j + 2 where j is even are 2 mod 6, which is not 5 mod 6. Therefore, they are not of the form 6k + 5. 

Alternatively, if j is odd, then j = 2m + 1. Then, 3j + 2 = 3*(2m + 1) + 2 = 6m + 3 + 2 = 6m + 5. Which is exactly 6k + 5 where k = m. Therefore, when j is odd, 3j + 2 is 6k + 5. But when j is even, 3j + 2 is 6m + 2, which is not 6k + 5. Therefore, only when j is odd do we get numbers of the form 6k + 5. Therefore, not all numbers of the form 3j + 2 are of the form 6k + 5. 

Therefore, the converse is not true. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of congruence. Let me consider the congruence classes. 

Numbers of the form 6k + 5 are congruent to 5 mod 6. Numbers of the form 3j + 2 are congruent to 2 mod 3. Now, since 6 is a multiple of 3, the congruence mod 6 is more specific. If a number is congruent to 5 mod 6, then it is congruent to 5 mod 3. But 5 mod 3 is 2. Therefore, numbers congruent to 5 mod 6 are congruent to 2 mod 3. Therefore, 6k + 5 ≡ 2 mod 3. Therefore, the set of numbers of the form 6k + 5 is a subset of the numbers of the form 3j + 2. 

But the converse is not true because numbers of the form 3j + 2 include numbers that are 2 mod 3, which can be either 2 mod 6 or 5 mod 6. Therefore, only half of the numbers congruent to 2 mod 3 are congruent to 5 mod 6. 

So, for example, numbers congruent to 2 mod 3 are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17,... which mod 6 are 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5,... So alternating between 2 and 5 mod 6. Therefore, only the odd ones (when j is odd) are 5 mod 6. Therefore, only half of the numbers in 3j + 2 are in 6k + 5. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that 6k + 5 is a subset of 3j + 2, but not the other way around. 

Therefore, the problem is solved. 

But let me check again with another example. Take 8, which is 3*2 + 2. 8 divided by 6 is 1 with remainder 2, so 8 is 6*1 + 2. Therefore, 8 is not of the form 6k + 5. Therefore, 8 is 3j + 2 but not 6k + 5. Therefore, that's a concrete example. 

Alternatively, take 5, which is 6*0 + 5, and 5 is also 3*1 + 2. So that works. 

Another example: 11 is 6*1 + 5, and 11 is 3*3 + 2. So that works. 

But 2 is 3*0 + 2, and 2 is not 6k + 5. 

Therefore, the conclusion is correct. 

So, to summarize:

To show that any integer of the form 6k + 5 is also of the form 3j + 2:

Express 6k + 5 as 3*(2k) + 5. Then, since 5 = 3*1 + 2, substitute to get 3*(2k + 1) + 2. Therefore, j = 2k + 1, so it is of the form 3j + 2.

To show that not all numbers of the form 3j + 2 are of the form 6k + 5:

Note that numbers of the form 3j + 2 can be either 2 mod 6 or 5 mod 6, depending on whether j is even or odd. For example, if j is even, say j = 2m, then 3j + 2 = 6m + 2, which is 2 mod 6. If j is odd, j = 2m + 1, then 3j + 2 = 6m + 5, which is 5 mod 6. Therefore, only when j is odd do we get numbers of the form 6k + 5. Therefore, there are numbers of the form 3j + 2 (like 2, 8, 14, etc.) that are not of the form 6k + 5. 

Therefore, the statement is proven.

**Final Answer**
Any integer of the form $6k + 5$ is also of the form $3j + 2$, but not conversely. Thus, the final answer is \boxed{3j + 2}.

To show that any integer of the form $6k + 5$ is also of the form $3j + 2$, we begin by analyzing the structure of these expressions.

### Step 1: Expressing $6k + 5$ in the form $3j + 2$

We start with the expression:

$$
6k + 5
$$

We can factor out a 3 from the first term:

$$
6k + 5 = 3(2k) + 5
$$

Now, observe that $5 = 3 \cdot 1 + 2$, so we can rewrite the expression as:

$$
3(2k) + 3(1) + 2 = 3(2k + 1) + 2
$$

Letting $j = 2k + 1$, we get:

$$
6k + 5 = 3j + 2
$$

Thus, **any integer of the form $6k + 5$ can be expressed as $3j + 2$**.

---

### Step 2: Showing that not all integers of the form $3j + 2$ are of the form $6k + 5$

We now examine the reverse direction: **Is every integer of the form $3j + 2$ also of the form $6k + 5$?**

Let’s consider the possible values of $j$ modulo 2:

- If $j$ is **even**, say $j = 2m$, then:
  $$
  3j + 2 = 3(2m) + 2 = 6m + 2
  $$
  This is **not** of the form $6k + 5$, since $6m + 2 \equiv 2 \pmod{6}$, not $5$.

- If $j$ is **odd**, say $j = 2m + 1$, then:
  $$
  3j + 2 = 3(2m + 1) + 2 = 6m + 3 + 2 = 6m + 5
  $$
  This **is** of the form $6k + 5$, with $k = m$.

So, **only when $j$ is odd** does $3j + 2$ become of the form $6k + 5$. When $j$ is even, the result is $6m + 2$, which is not of the form $6k + 5$.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion

- Every number of the form $6k + 5$ is also of the form $3j + 2$.
- However, **not all** numbers of the form $3j + 2$ are of the form $6k + 5$.

This is because the set of numbers congruent to $2 \mod 3$ includes both numbers congruent to $2 \mod 6$ and $5 \mod 6$, and only the ones congruent to $5 \mod 6$ are of the form $6k + 5$.

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{3j + 2}
$$
