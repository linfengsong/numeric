Okay, so I need to prove that if a and b are odd integers, then 8 divides (a² - b²). Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that when dealing with divisibility by 8, it's often helpful to look at the numbers modulo 8. Since we're dealing with squares, maybe I can find the possible residues of squares modulo 8 and see what differences there are. 

But before that, let me recall that odd integers can be written in the form 2k + 1, where k is an integer. So maybe I can express a and b as 2k + 1 and 2m + 1, respectively, where k and m are integers. Then, I can compute a² - b² and see if it's divisible by 8.

Let me try that. Let's let a = 2k + 1 and b = 2m + 1. Then:

a² = (2k + 1)² = 4k² + 4k + 1

Similarly, b² = (2m + 1)² = 4m² + 4m + 1

Therefore, a² - b² = (4k² + 4k + 1) - (4m² + 4m + 1) = 4k² + 4k - 4m² - 4m

Factor out the 4: 4(k² + k - m² - m) = 4[(k² - m²) + (k - m)]

Hmm, maybe I can factor further. Let me see:

k² - m² is (k - m)(k + m), so then:

a² - b² = 4[(k - m)(k + m) + (k - m)] = 4(k - m)(k + m + 1)

So that's 4 times (k - m) times (k + m + 1). Now, I need to show that this is divisible by 8, which means that the entire expression must be a multiple of 8. Since we have a factor of 4, we need the remaining part (k - m)(k + m + 1) to be even. So if (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even, then 4 times even is 8 times something, hence divisible by 8.

So, the key is to show that (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even. Let me think about whether this product is even. For a product of two integers to be even, at least one of them must be even. So, either (k - m) is even, or (k + m + 1) is even. 

But how can I determine that? Let me think about the parity of k and m. Since a and b are odd, they are of the form 2k + 1 and 2m + 1. However, k and m can be any integers, so they can be even or odd. Let me consider different cases based on the parity of k and m.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me think about the original problem again. Since a and b are odd, their squares are congruent to 1 modulo 8? Wait, let me check that.

Let me recall that squares modulo 8. Let's compute squares of numbers from 0 to 7 modulo 8:

0² = 0 mod 8

1² = 1 mod 8

2² = 4 mod 8

3² = 9 ≡ 1 mod 8

4² = 16 ≡ 0 mod 8

5² = 25 ≡ 1 mod 8

6² = 36 ≡ 4 mod 8

7² = 49 ≡ 1 mod 8

So, the squares modulo 8 are either 0, 1, or 4. However, since a and b are odd, their squares are 1 mod 8? Wait, let me check:

If a is odd, then a is congruent to 1, 3, 5, or 7 mod 8. Then:

1² = 1 mod 8

3² = 9 ≡ 1 mod 8

5² = 25 ≡ 1 mod 8

7² = 49 ≡ 1 mod 8

So indeed, any odd integer squared is congruent to 1 mod 8. Therefore, a² ≡ 1 mod 8 and b² ≡ 1 mod 8. Therefore, a² - b² ≡ 1 - 1 = 0 mod 8. Therefore, 8 divides (a² - b²). 

Wait, that seems straightforward. But why did I go through all that earlier with the expressions in terms of k and m? Maybe that was a longer way. But this seems much simpler. 

But let me check with an example. Let me take a = 3 and b = 1. Then a² - b² = 9 - 1 = 8, which is divisible by 8. Another example: a = 5, b = 3. Then 25 - 9 = 16, which is divisible by 8. Another example: a = 7, b = 5. 49 - 25 = 24, which is divisible by 8. If I take a = 1 and b = 1, then 1 - 1 = 0, which is divisible by 8. 

What if a and b are different? Let me take a = 3 and b = 5. Then 9 - 25 = -16, which is divisible by 8. So seems like it works. 

But then why did I get stuck earlier with the expression in terms of k and m? Maybe I can reconcile both approaches. 

From the first approach, we had that a² - b² = 4(k - m)(k + m + 1). So if we can show that (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even, then 4 times even is 8 times something. 

But how can we show that (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even? Let me think. Let me note that k and m are integers. Let me consider the parity of k and m. 

Case 1: Both k and m are even. Then, k - m is even - even = even. So (k - m) is even, so the product is even. 

Case 2: Both k and m are odd. Then, k - m is odd - odd = even. Again, (k - m) is even, so the product is even.

Case 3: One is even and the other is odd. Then, k - m is even - odd = odd, or odd - even = odd. So (k - m) is odd. Then, we need to check if (k + m + 1) is even. 

If k is even and m is odd: k + m is even + odd = odd. Then, odd + 1 = even. So (k + m + 1) is even. Therefore, the product is odd * even = even. 

Similarly, if k is odd and m is even: k + m is odd + even = odd. Then, odd + 1 = even. So again, (k + m + 1) is even, so the product is odd * even = even. 

Therefore, in all cases, (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even. Therefore, 4 times even is divisible by 8. Therefore, the conclusion holds. 

So both approaches confirm that 8 divides (a² - b²). 

Alternatively, using the modulo 8 approach, since both a² and b² are congruent to 1 mod 8, their difference is 0 mod 8. 

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the conclusion is that 8 divides a² - b². 

But let me check if there's another way to think about this. Maybe by factoring a² - b² as (a - b)(a + b). Since a and b are both odd, then a - b is even (odd minus odd is even) and a + b is even (odd plus odd is even). Therefore, (a - b)(a + b) is the product of two even numbers. 

So, let me write that: (a - b)(a + b). Since both factors are even, each is divisible by 2, so their product is divisible by 4. But we need divisibility by 8. Therefore, we need to check if one of them is divisible by 4, or both are divisible by 2 but in such a way that the product is divisible by 8. 

Let me think. Let me write a - b and a + b. Since a and b are both odd, let me denote a = 2k + 1 and b = 2m + 1. Then, a - b = 2(k - m), which is 2 times an integer. Similarly, a + b = 2(k + m + 1). Therefore, (a - b)(a + b) = 4(k - m)(k + m + 1). Which is the same expression as before. Therefore, again, we need to show that (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even. Which we did earlier. 

Alternatively, since a - b and a + b are both even, let me write them as 2p and 2q, where p and q are integers. Then, their product is 4pq. So, 4pq must be divisible by 8, so pq must be even. Therefore, pq is even. Which means that either p or q is even. 

But p = (a - b)/2 and q = (a + b)/2. Let me check if either p or q is even. 

But since a and b are both odd, let me consider their sum and difference. Let me think about the parity of p and q. 

Let me take a and b as odd numbers. Let me consider their sum and difference. 

Let me take a = 2k + 1 and b = 2m + 1. Then:

a + b = 2k + 1 + 2m + 1 = 2(k + m + 1). Therefore, q = (a + b)/2 = k + m + 1. 

Similarly, a - b = 2(k - m). Therefore, p = (a - b)/2 = k - m. 

So, p = k - m and q = k + m + 1. 

Earlier, we saw that either p or q is even. Let me check:

If k and m are both even or both odd, then p = k - m is even. If one is even and the other is odd, then p = k - m is odd, but then q = k + m + 1 is even. Therefore, in either case, either p or q is even, so pq is even. Therefore, 4pq is divisible by 8. 

Therefore, this approach also works. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to think about it in terms of modular arithmetic. Since a and b are odd, they are congruent to 1 or 3 or 5 or 7 mod 8. As we saw earlier, their squares are all congruent to 1 mod 8. Therefore, the difference between two squares is 1 - 1 = 0 mod 8. 

But let me check if that's always the case. Suppose a ≡ 1 mod 8, then a² ≡ 1 mod 8. Similarly, if a ≡ 3 mod 8, then a² ≡ 9 ≡ 1 mod 8. Similarly for 5 and 7. Therefore, regardless of which odd number a is, its square is 1 mod 8. Therefore, a² - b² ≡ 1 - 1 = 0 mod 8. Therefore, 8 divides a² - b². 

This seems like the most straightforward way. 

But maybe I need to make sure that this is true for all odd integers. Let me think again. 

Suppose a is odd, so a = 2k + 1. Then, a² = 4k² + 4k + 1 = 4k(k + 1) + 1. Now, since k and k + 1 are consecutive integers, one of them is even, so 4k(k + 1) is divisible by 8. Therefore, a² ≡ 1 mod 8. 

Yes, that's another way to see it. Because 4 times an even number is 8 times something. Therefore, a² = 8m + 1, so a² ≡ 1 mod 8. Similarly for b². Therefore, their difference is 0 mod 8. 

Therefore, this is a solid proof. 

But let me check with specific numbers again. Let me take a = 5, which is 5 mod 8. 5² = 25, which is 1 mod 8. Similarly, 7² = 49, which is 1 mod 8. 3² = 9, which is 1 mod 8. 1² = 1 mod 8. So yes, all odd squares are 1 mod 8. 

Therefore, the difference between two odd squares is 1 - 1 = 0 mod 8. Therefore, 8 divides the difference. 

So, the conclusion is that 8 divides (a² - b²) when a and b are odd. 

Alternatively, if I didn't remember that odd squares are 1 mod 8, I could have gone through the algebraic approach. 

But since both approaches confirm the same result, I think this is solid. 

Therefore, the assertion is proven. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{8}
</think>

To establish the assertion that **if $ a $ and $ b $ are odd integers, then $ 8 \mid (a^2 - b^2) $**, we proceed by analyzing the properties of odd integers and their squares.

### Step 1: Expressing Odd Integers

Let $ a = 2k + 1 $ and $ b = 2m + 1 $, where $ k $ and $ m $ are integers. These expressions represent any odd integer in terms of an integer parameter.

---

### Step 2: Compute the Difference of Squares

We compute:

$$
a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
$$
$$
b^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1
$$

Then:

$$
a^2 - b^2 = (4k^2 + 4k + 1) - (4m^2 + 4m + 1) = 4(k^2 + k - m^2 - m)
$$

Factor the expression:

$$
a^2 - b^2 = 4[(k - m)(k + m + 1)]
$$

So, the expression is a multiple of 4. To show it is a multiple of 8, we need to show that the term $ (k - m)(k + m + 1) $ is even.

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Parity of the Product

We examine the parity (even or odd nature) of the two factors in the product $ (k - m)(k + m + 1) $:

- Since $ a $ and $ b $ are both odd, $ a - b $ and $ a + b $ are both even.
- Therefore, $ a - b = 2(k - m) $ and $ a + b = 2(k + m + 1) $, both even.
- Thus, $ (a - b)(a + b) = 4(k - m)(k + m + 1) $, which is divisible by 4.

To show it is divisible by 8, we must show that $ (k - m)(k + m + 1) $ is even.

This is true in all cases:

- If $ k $ and $ m $ are both even or both odd, $ k - m $ is even.
- If $ k $ and $ m $ have different parities, then $ k + m + 1 $ is even.

In either case, the product is even, so the entire expression is divisible by 8.

---

### Step 4: Modular Arithmetic Approach (Alternative)

Alternatively, we can consider the squares of odd integers modulo 8.

- Any odd integer is congruent to $ 1, 3, 5, $ or $ 7 \mod 8 $.
- The square of any odd number modulo 8 is always:

$$
1^2 \equiv 1, \quad 3^2 \equiv 9 \equiv 1, \quad 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 1, \quad 7^2 \equiv 49 \equiv 1 \mod 8
$$

So, $ a^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 $ and $ b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 $, hence:

$$
a^2 - b^2 \equiv 1 - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 8
$$

This confirms that $ 8 \mid (a^2 - b^2) $.

---

### Final Conclusion

Both algebraic and modular arithmetic approaches confirm that when $ a $ and $ b $ are odd integers, their squares differ by a multiple of 8.
