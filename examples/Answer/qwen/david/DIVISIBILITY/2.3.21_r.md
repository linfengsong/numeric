Okay, so I need to solve part (a) and (b) of this problem. Let me start with part (a). The question says: Prove that if d divides n, then 2^d - 1 divides 2^n - 1. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with divisibility of numbers like 2^d - 1 and 2^n - 1, there might be some properties related to exponents and modular arithmetic. Maybe I can use the concept of modular arithmetic here. If d divides n, then n can be written as n = d * k for some integer k. So maybe I can express 2^n - 1 in terms of 2^d - 1?

Let me try that. Let's say n = d * k. Then 2^n - 1 = 2^{d*k} - 1. I need to show that 2^d - 1 divides this. There's a formula for factoring differences of powers. For example, a^m - 1 factors as (a - 1)(a^{m-1} + a^{m-2} + ... + 1). But here, we have 2^{d*k} - 1. Maybe I can write this as (2^d)^k - 1. So that would be (2^d - 1)(something). Let me check.

Yes, the formula says that a^k - 1 = (a - 1)(a^{k-1} + a^{k-2} + ... + 1). So if I let a = 2^d, then a^k - 1 = (2^d)^k - 1 = 2^{d*k} - 1 = 2^n - 1. Therefore, this factors into (2^d - 1)(something). Therefore, 2^d - 1 divides 2^n - 1. Therefore, the statement is proven.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But maybe I should check with an example. Let me take d = 2, n = 4. Then 2^2 - 1 = 3, and 2^4 - 1 = 15. 3 divides 15, which is true. Another example: d = 3, n = 6. 2^3 - 1 = 7, 2^6 - 1 = 63. 7 divides 63. Yes, 63 / 7 = 9. So that works.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of modular arithmetic. If 2^d ≡ 1 mod (2^d - 1), then 2^{d*k} ≡ 1^k = 1 mod (2^d - 1). Therefore, 2^n ≡ 1 mod (2^d - 1), so 2^n - 1 ≡ 0 mod (2^d - 1). Therefore, 2^d - 1 divides 2^n - 1. That seems like another way to think about it.

So both approaches seem to work. Therefore, the proof is done by either factoring or using modular arithmetic. So part (a) is proven.

Now moving on to part (b): Verify that 2^{35} - 1 is divisible by 31 and 127. So I need to check that 31 divides 2^{35} - 1 and 127 divides 2^{35} - 1.

First, let me check 31. To check if 31 divides 2^{35} - 1, I can compute 2^{35} mod 31 and see if it's equal to 1.

Alternatively, I can use Fermat's little theorem. Since 31 is prime, Fermat's little theorem says that 2^{30} ≡ 1 mod 31. Therefore, 2^{30} ≡ 1 mod 31. Then 2^{35} = 2^{30} * 2^5 ≡ 1 * 2^5 mod 31. 2^5 is 32. 32 mod 31 is 1. Therefore, 2^{35} ≡ 1 mod 31. Therefore, 2^{35} - 1 ≡ 0 mod 31. Therefore, 31 divides 2^{35} - 1. That's good.

Now check 127. Similarly, 127 is prime. So by Fermat's little theorem, 2^{126} ≡ 1 mod 127. But we need to check 2^{35} mod 127. Hmm. Maybe I can find the order of 2 modulo 127? Or perhaps find some exponent that relates to 35.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute 2^7 mod 127. Wait, 2^7 is 128. 128 mod 127 is 1. Wait, that's interesting. So 2^7 ≡ 1 mod 127. Therefore, 2^7 ≡ 1 mod 127. Therefore, 2^{35} = 2^{7*5} = (2^7)^5 ≡ 1^5 = 1 mod 127. Therefore, 2^{35} - 1 ≡ 0 mod 127. Therefore, 127 divides 2^{35} - 1. Therefore, both 31 and 127 divide 2^{35} - 1.

Wait, but let me verify that 2^7 ≡ 1 mod 127. Let me compute 2^7: 2^7 is 128. 128 - 127 = 1, so yes, 128 ≡ 1 mod 127. Therefore, that is correct. Therefore, 2^7 ≡ 1 mod 127. Therefore, 2^{35} is 2^{7*5} which is (2^7)^5 ≡ 1^5 = 1 mod 127. Therefore, 2^{35} - 1 is 0 mod 127.

But wait, maybe I should check if 7 divides 35? Yes, 35 is 7*5. So that's why 2^{35} is (2^7)^5. Therefore, that works. Therefore, 127 divides 2^{35} - 1.

But let me check with another method. Maybe compute 2^35 mod 127 step by step. Let me try that. Although that might take longer, but just to confirm.

Alternatively, since 2^7 ≡ 1 mod 127, then 2^7k ≡ 1^k = 1 mod 127. Therefore, 2^{35} = 2^{7*5} ≡ 1 mod 127. Therefore, that's straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can check if 35 is a multiple of the order of 2 modulo 127. Wait, the order of 2 modulo 127 divides 126 (since 127 is prime). But since 2^7 ≡ 1 mod 127, the order of 2 modulo 127 divides 7. But 7 is prime. So the order is either 1 or 7. But 2^1 = 2 ≠ 1 mod 127, so order is 7. Therefore, 7 divides 35, so 2^{35} = (2^7)^5 ≡ 1^5 = 1 mod 127. Therefore, that's correct.

Therefore, both 31 and 127 divide 2^{35} - 1. Therefore, part (b) is verified.

But just to be thorough, let me check with actual computation for 31. Let me compute 2^5 mod 31. 2^5 is 32, which is 1 mod 31. Therefore, 2^5 ≡ 1 mod 31. Therefore, 2^{35} = 2^{5*7} = (2^5)^7 ≡ 1^7 = 1 mod 31. Therefore, 2^{35} - 1 ≡ 0 mod 31. So that's correct.

Alternatively, 35 divided by 5 is 7, so that's why.

Therefore, both 31 and 127 divide 2^{35} - 1. Therefore, part (b) is verified.

Wait, but maybe I should check if 31 and 127 are factors of 2^{35} - 1. Let me check 2^35 - 1. But 2^35 is a huge number, so I can't compute it directly. But maybe I can use another approach.

Alternatively, for 31: Since 2^5 ≡ 1 mod 31, then 2^5k ≡ 1 mod 31. Therefore, 35 is 5*7, so 2^35 ≡ 1 mod 31. Similarly for 127, since 2^7 ≡ 1 mod 127, so 2^35 = 2^{7*5} ≡ 1 mod 127. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can check if 31 divides 2^35 - 1. Let me compute 2^35 mod 31. Since 2^5 ≡ 1 mod 31, then 2^5 = 32 ≡ 1. Therefore, 2^5 ≡ 1. Then 2^35 = 2^(5*7) = (2^5)^7 ≡ 1^7 = 1 mod 31. Therefore, 2^35 - 1 ≡ 0 mod 31. Similarly for 127. Therefore, that's correct.

Therefore, both parts are verified. Therefore, the answer is correct.

But let me check if there's any mistake here. For example, for part (a), is there any case where d divides n but 2^d - 1 does not divide 2^n - 1? Let me think. Suppose d = 1, n = 1. Then 2^1 - 1 = 1 divides 2^1 - 1 = 1. That works. If d = 2, n = 4. 2^2 - 1 = 3 divides 2^4 - 1 = 15. Yes, 15 / 3 = 5. If d = 3, n = 6. 2^3 - 1 = 7 divides 2^6 - 1 = 63. 63 / 7 = 9. So that works. If d = 4, n = 4. 2^4 - 1 = 15 divides 15. Yes. If d = 2, n = 6. Then 2^2 - 1 = 3 divides 2^6 - 1 = 63. 63 / 3 = 21. Yes. So seems like the formula works.

Alternatively, if d = 2, n = 2. Then 2^2 - 1 divides 2^2 - 1. Yes. So seems like the proof is correct.

Therefore, part (a) is proven, and part (b) is verified.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{2^d - 1 \mid 2^n - 1} is proven.

(b) $2^{35} - 1$ is divisible by both 31 and 127, so the answers are \boxed{31} and \boxed{127}.

But since the question says "Verify that $2^{35} - 1$ is divisible by 31 and 127", the answer for part (b) is just confirming that both numbers divide it. However, the problem might expect to write the verification steps, but since the user asked for the final answer within boxes, maybe for part (b), the answer is just stating that both 31 and 127 divide it. However, in the original problem, part (b) says "Verify that...", so maybe the answer is just confirming that, but since the user might expect boxed numbers? Wait, looking back at the problem:

"(b) Verify that $2^{35} - 1$ is divisible by 31 and 127."

But the user instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Since part (a) is a proof, but the user might expect for part (b) to have boxed answers? However, in the original problem, part (b) is a verification, so maybe the answer is just confirming that 31 and 127 divide it, but the user might expect to write that in boxed form? But the problem says "Verify that...", so maybe the answer is just stating that both 31 and 127 divide it. However, since the user might have intended for part (b) to have boxed numbers, but the question is not asking for the quotient or anything. Maybe the answer is just confirming that they are divisors. However, since the user might have wanted the answers for part (b) to be boxed, but since it's a verification, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to write that both 31 and 127 divide 2^35 - 1, so in the answer, for part (b), the answer is just stating that, but in the format of boxed numbers? Maybe not. Since the original problem is in Chinese, maybe the user wants the answers for (a) and (b) as boxed. But part (a) is a proof, so maybe the answer is just stating that the statement is proven. However, in the initial problem, part (a) is a proof, so maybe the answer is just the statement. But in the instructions, the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Maybe for part (a), the answer is just the statement, but since it's a proof, maybe not. However, the user might have intended for part (a) to have a boxed answer, but since it's a proof, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe part (a) is just a proof, and part (b) is to verify that 31 and 127 divide 2^35 - 1, so the answer for (b) is that both are divisors. However, since the user might want the answers for (a) and (b) in boxed format, but for (a), it's a proof, so maybe not. But the original problem says "Verify that...", so maybe the answer is just confirming that, but since the user wants the final answer in boxed, maybe for part (b), the answer is that both 31 and 127 divide it, so boxed numbers? But the problem says "Verify that...", not "Find the divisors...". Maybe the answer is just that, but the user might have intended for part (b) to have the numbers boxed. However, since the problem is in Chinese, maybe the user is following a specific format. But since the user hasn't specified, and given the initial problem, part (a) is a proof, and part (b) is a verification. Since the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", maybe for part (a), the answer is just stating the theorem, but since it's a proof, maybe not. However, in many math problems, part (a) is a proof, and part (b) is a verification. Since the user might have expected for part (b) to have the numbers 31 and 127 in boxes, but since the question is to verify that 2^35 -1 is divisible by them, maybe the answer is just confirming that, but since the user wants boxed answers, maybe for part (b), the answer is both 31 and 127. However, in the problem statement, part (b) is to verify that 2^35 -1 is divisible by 31 and 127, so maybe the answer is just stating that they are divisors, but in the format of boxed numbers. However, since the user might have intended for part (b) to have the numbers 31 and 127 boxed, but I need to check the original problem's instructions. 

Looking back, the user wrote:

"(a) Prove that if d | n, then $2^d - 1 |2^n - 1$.

(b) Verify that $2^{35} - 1$ is divisible by 31 and 127."

So part (a) is a proof, and part (b) is a verification. The user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Since part (a) is a proof, but the user might expect a boxed answer for part (a) as well. However, in standard math problems, proofs are not boxed. However, maybe the user is expecting the answer for part (a) to be the statement that it's proven, but since the user might have intended for part (a) to have a boxed answer, but I think that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the answer for part (a) is just the statement, and part (b) is to write the numbers 31 and 127 in boxes. However, since part (b) is a verification, not a calculation, maybe the answer is that they divide it, but since the user wants boxed answers, maybe the answer is just stating that 31 and 127 divide it. But since the problem says "Verify that...", maybe the answer is just confirming that, but in the format of boxed numbers. However, since the problem is about divisibility, maybe the answer is that both are divisors. But since the user might have intended for part (b) to have the numbers 31 and 127 boxed, but I need to check the original problem's intention. 

Alternatively, since the user might have wanted the answers for part (b) to be the divisors, so maybe \boxed{31} and \boxed{127}. But since the question is to verify that 2^35 -1 is divisible by them, not to find them, but since the user says to put the final answer in boxes, maybe that's the way. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a textbook where part (b) is to show that 31 and 127 divide 2^35 -1, and the answer is just confirming that, but since the user wants boxed answers, maybe just writing the numbers. However, in the absence of specific instructions, I think the safest way is to answer part (a) as a proof and part (b) as verifying the divisibility, but since the user might expect boxed answers for (b), I'll go with that.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{2^d - 1 \mid 2^n - 1}

(b) \boxed{31} and \boxed{127}
</think>

To address the problem, we analyze and verify the statements step by step.

### **(a) Proof that if $ d \mid n $, then $ 2^d - 1 \mid 2^n - 1 $**

We are given that $ d \mid n $, which implies $ n = d \cdot k $ for some integer $ k $.

We aim to show that $ 2^d - 1 $ divides $ 2^n - 1 $, i.e., $ 2^d - 1 \mid 2^{d \cdot k} - 1 $.

Using the identity for the difference of powers:

$$
a^m - 1 = (a - 1)(a^{m-1} + a^{m-2} + \cdots + 1)
$$

Let $ a = 2^d $, and $ m = k $. Then:

$$
2^{d \cdot k} - 1 = (2^d)^k - 1 = (2^d - 1)(2^{d(k-1)} + 2^{d(k-2)} + \cdots + 1)
$$

This shows that $ 2^d - 1 $ is a factor of $ 2^n - 1 $, since $ 2^n - 1 = 2^{d \cdot k} - 1 $.

Alternatively, using modular arithmetic:

Since $ 2^d \equiv 1 \pmod{2^d - 1} $, it follows that:

$$
2^{d \cdot k} \equiv 1^k = 1 \pmod{2^d - 1}
\Rightarrow 2^n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^d - 1}
\Rightarrow 2^n - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{2^d - 1}
$$

Thus, $ 2^d - 1 \mid 2^n - 1 $.

---

### **(b) Verification that $ 2^{35} - 1 $ is divisible by 31 and 127**

We verify this by computing $ 2^{35} \mod 31 $ and $ 2^{35} \mod 127 $, and checking if both are congruent to 1.

#### **Verification for 31:**

Since 31 is prime, by **Fermat's Little Theorem**, we have:

$$
2^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{31}
\Rightarrow 2^{35} = 2^{30} \cdot 2^5 \equiv 1 \cdot 32 \equiv 1 \pmod{31}
$$

Thus, $ 2^{35} - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{31} $, so 31 divides $ 2^{35} - 1 $.

#### **Verification for 127:**

Similarly, 127 is prime, so:

$$
2^{126} \equiv 1 \pmod{127}
$$

But we can find a smaller exponent that satisfies $ 2^k \equiv 1 \pmod{127} $. Noting that:

$$
2^7 = 128 \equiv 1 \pmod{127}
$$

So:

$$
2^{35} = 2^{7 \cdot 5} = (2^7)^5 \equiv 1^5 = 1 \pmod{127}
\Rightarrow 2^{35} - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{127}
$$

Thus, 127 divides $ 2^{35} - 1 $.

---

### **Final Answers**

(a) $ \boxed{2^d - 1 \mid 2^n - 1} $ is proven.

(b) $ 2^{35} - 1 $ is divisible by both $ \boxed{31} $ and $ \boxed{127} $.
