Okay, so I need to find integers x, y, z such that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 198, 288, and 512 is equal to 198x + 288y + 512z. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the gcd of these numbers is. 

First, maybe I should compute the gcd of 198, 288, and 512. To do that, I can start by finding the gcd of two numbers first and then take that result with the third number. Let me remember how to compute gcds. 

So, gcd(198, 288). Let me use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm says that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b). Let me compute 198 and 288. 

First, divide 288 by 198. 198 goes into 288 once, with a remainder of 288 - 198 = 90. So gcd(198, 288) = gcd(198, 90). Now, divide 198 by 90. 90 goes into 198 twice, remainder 198 - 180 = 18. So now gcd(90, 18). Divide 90 by 18, which is 5 times with remainder 0. So gcd is 18. 

So gcd(198, 288) is 18. Now, I need to find gcd(18, 512). Let's do that. Divide 512 by 18. 18*28 = 504, so remainder is 512 - 504 = 8. So gcd(18, 512) = gcd(18, 8). Then divide 18 by 8: 8*2=16, remainder 2. So gcd(8, 2). Then divide 8 by 2: remainder 0. So gcd is 2. 

Therefore, the gcd of 198, 288, and 512 is 2. So the equation we need is 2 = 198x + 288y + 512z. 

Now, I need to find integers x, y, z such that this equation holds. 

I remember that for two numbers, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find coefficients, but here we have three numbers. However, since the gcd is 2, maybe I can first find coefficients for two numbers and then combine them with the third? Or maybe find coefficients for all three?

Alternatively, since 2 is the gcd, there exist integers a, b, c such that 198a + 288b + 512c = 2. But how do I find such integers?

Alternatively, maybe I can first find the gcd of 198 and 288, which we already found is 18, and then find the gcd of 18 and 512, which is 2. So perhaps I can first find integers such that 18 = 198x + 288y, and then use that to find integers for the equation 2 = 18x' + 512y', then combine them?

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think.

Let me first find integers x1, y1 such that 198x1 + 288y1 = 18. Then, since 18 and 512 have gcd 2, we can find integers x2, y2 such that 18x2 + 512y2 = 2. Then combining these, we can get 198x1x2 + 288y1x2 + 512y2 = 2. But that seems a bit abstract. Maybe I need to do it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the extended Euclidean algorithm on all three numbers. But I don't remember exactly how to do that. Maybe it's easier to first find the gcd of 198, 288, 512 by breaking it down step by step.

Alternatively, since 2 divides all three numbers, we can divide each number by 2 and then find coefficients for 1, 144, 256. Wait, 198/2=99, 288/2=144, 512/2=256. So the equation becomes 2 = 2*(99x + 144y + 256z). Therefore, 1 = 99x + 144y + 256z. So maybe solving for 1 as a combination of 99, 144, 256. But I don't know if that helps. Maybe?

Alternatively, maybe I can find x, y, z such that 198x + 288y + 512z = 2. Let me try to find such integers. 

First, note that 198 is even, 288 is even, 512 is even. So all coefficients are even, so 2 is even. So maybe I can divide the entire equation by 2? Let me try that. Dividing both sides by 2 gives 99x + 144y + 256z = 1. So now I need to find integers x, y, z such that 99x + 144y + 256z = 1. 

Hmm, that might be easier? Maybe. Let me think. How can I find integers x, y, z such that this equation holds? 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the extended Euclidean algorithm for two numbers first. For example, let me find integers a and b such that 99a + 144b = gcd(99, 144). Then, since gcd(99, 144) is 9? Wait, 99 is 9*11, 144 is 12^2 = 16*9. So gcd(99, 144) is 9. Then, since 256 is 2^8, which is co-prime with 9? Wait, 256 is 2^8, so gcd(9, 256) is 1. Therefore, since 9 and 256 are coprime, there exist integers c and d such that 9c + 256d = 1. Then, combining with the previous equation, we can get 99a + 144b = 9, and then 9c + 256d = 1, so multiplying the first equation by c and the second by 9? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, since 99x + 144y + 256z = 1. Let me first find coefficients for 99 and 144. Let me find integers a and b such that 99a + 144b = 9. Then, since 9 and 256 are coprime, we can find integers c and d such that 9c + 256d = 1. Then, substituting, we can write 99a*c + 144b*c + 256d = 1. But that would be 99(a c) + 144(b c) + 256d = 1. So then, if I set x = a c, y = b c, z = d, that would work. But maybe this is a bit convoluted. Let me try to compute it step by step.

First, find a and b such that 99a + 144b = 9. Let me divide the equation by 9: 11a + 16b = 1. So solving 11a + 16b = 1. Let me use the extended Euclidean algorithm for 11 and 16.

Compute gcd(11, 16). 16 divided by 11 is 1 with remainder 5. Then 11 divided by 5 is 2 with remainder 1. Then 5 divided by 1 is 5 with remainder 0. So gcd is 1. Now, backtracking:

1 = 11 - 2*5

But 5 = 16 - 1*11, so substitute:

1 = 11 - 2*(16 - 1*11) = 11 - 2*16 + 2*11 = 3*11 - 2*16

Therefore, 1 = 3*11 - 2*16. Therefore, multiplying both sides by 1 (since we had 11a + 16b = 1), so a = 3, b = -2. Therefore, 11*3 + 16*(-2) = 33 - 32 = 1. Therefore, going back to the original equation: 99a + 144b = 9. Since 99 = 9*11, 144 = 9*16. Therefore, 9*(11a + 16b) = 9*1 = 9. Therefore, if we take a = 3, b = -2, then 99*3 + 144*(-2) = 9. Therefore, that gives us 99*3 + 144*(-2) = 9. 

So then, we can write 9 = 99*3 + 144*(-2). Then, since we need 99x + 144y + 256z = 1, we can take this equation and then find integers c and d such that 9c + 256d = 1. Then, multiplying the first equation by c and adding to the second equation? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. 

Let me denote that 9 = 99*3 + 144*(-2). Then, if we can write 9c + 256d = 1, then substituting 9 with the expression above, we have:

(99*3 + 144*(-2)) * c + 256d = 1

Which is 99*(3c) + 144*(-2c) + 256d = 1. Therefore, this would be 99x + 144y + 256z = 1 where x = 3c, y = -2c, z = d. Therefore, we need to find integers c and d such that 9c + 256d = 1. 

So let me solve 9c + 256d = 1. Again, using the extended Euclidean algorithm for 9 and 256. 

Compute gcd(9, 256). 256 divided by 9 is 28 with remainder 4 (since 9*28=252, 256-252=4). Then 9 divided by 4 is 2 with remainder 1. Then 4 divided by 1 is 4 with remainder 0. So gcd is 1. 

Now backtracking:

1 = 9 - 2*4

But 4 = 256 - 28*9. Substitute:

1 = 9 - 2*(256 - 28*9) = 9 - 2*256 + 56*9 = 57*9 - 2*256

Therefore, 1 = 57*9 - 2*256. Therefore, c = 57, d = -2. Therefore, substituting back into our previous equation, we have:

x = 3c = 3*57 = 171

y = -2c = -2*57 = -114

z = d = -2

Therefore, substituting into 99x + 144y + 256z = 1:

99*171 + 144*(-114) + 256*(-2) = ?

Let me check if this equals 1. Let me compute each term:

First term: 99*171. Let me compute 100*171 - 1*171 = 17100 - 171 = 16929.

Second term: 144*(-114). Let me compute 144*114. 144*100=14400, 144*14=2016, so total 14400 + 2016 = 16416. Therefore, with the negative sign: -16416.

Third term: 256*(-2) = -512.

So total is 16929 - 16416 - 512. Let me compute 16929 - 16416 first: 16929 - 16416 = 513. Then 513 - 512 = 1. Yes! That works. 

Therefore, we have 99*171 + 144*(-114) + 256*(-2) = 1. Therefore, going back to the original equation, which was 198x + 288y + 512z = 2. Since we divided by 2 earlier, so 99x + 144y + 256z = 1. Therefore, multiplying both sides by 2, we get 198*(171) + 288*(-114) + 512*(-2) = 2. Therefore, the integers x, y, z are 171, -114, -2. 

But wait, let me check if that's correct. Let me compute 198*171 + 288*(-114) + 512*(-2). Let me compute each term:

First term: 198*171. Well, 200*171 = 34200, minus 2*171 = 342, so 34200 - 342 = 33858.

Second term: 288*(-114). Let me compute 288*114. Let me break it down: 288*(100 + 14) = 28800 + 288*14. 288*10=2880, 288*4=1152, so 2880 + 1152 = 4032. Therefore, 28800 + 4032 = 32832. Therefore, with the negative sign: -32832.

Third term: 512*(-2) = -1024.

So total is 33858 - 32832 - 1024. Let me compute 33858 - 32832 first: 33858 - 32832 = 1026. Then 1026 - 1024 = 2. Yes! That works. 

Therefore, the solution is x=171, y=-114, z=-2. But the problem says "Find integers x, y, z", so these are integers. However, maybe there are other solutions? But the question just asks for any integers, so this is a valid solution. 

But let me check if there are smaller numbers or something. But since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on x, y, z, just that they are integers, this is acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a simpler solution? Let me think. For example, maybe using different steps. 

Alternatively, since 198, 288, 512 are all even, maybe we can find some combination. Let me try to think of other ways. 

Alternatively, since 198 = 2*99, 288=2*144, 512=2*256, so the equation is 2 = 2*(99x + 144y + 256z), so 1 = 99x + 144y + 256z. So maybe I can find another way to write 1 as a combination of 99, 144, 256. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 256 - 2*144 = 256 - 288 = -32. Then, 99 - (-32)*something? Not sure. Let me try. 

Alternatively, think of 99 and 256. Let me try to find integers a and b such that 99a + 256b = 1. Then, once I have that, I can set y = 0 and solve for x and z. Let me try that. 

So solving 99a + 256b = 1. Let me use the extended Euclidean algorithm for 99 and 256. 

Compute gcd(99, 256). 256 divided by 99 is 2 with remainder 58 (since 2*99 = 198, 256 - 198 = 58). Then 99 divided by 58 is 1 with remainder 41. Then 58 divided by 41 is 1 with remainder 17. Then 41 divided by 17 is 2 with remainder 7. Then 17 divided by 7 is 2 with remainder 3. Then 7 divided by 3 is 2 with remainder 1. Then 3 divided by 1 is 3 with remainder 0. So gcd is 1. 

Now backtracking:

1 = 7 - 2*3

But 3 = 17 - 2*7, so substitute:

1 = 7 - 2*(17 - 2*7) = 7 - 2*17 + 4*7 = 5*7 - 2*17

But 7 = 41 - 2*17, substitute:

1 = 5*(41 - 2*17) - 2*17 = 5*41 - 10*17 - 2*17 = 5*41 - 12*17

But 17 = 58 - 1*41, substitute:

1 = 5*41 - 12*(58 - 41) = 5*41 - 12*58 + 12*41 = 17*41 - 12*58

But 41 = 99 - 1*58, substitute:

1 = 17*(99 - 58) - 12*58 = 17*99 - 17*58 - 12*58 = 17*99 - 29*58

But 58 = 256 - 2*99, substitute:

1 = 17*99 - 29*(256 - 2*99) = 17*99 - 29*256 + 58*99 = (17 + 58)*99 - 29*256 = 75*99 - 29*256

Therefore, 1 = 75*99 - 29*256. Therefore, a = 75, b = -29. Therefore, 99*75 + 256*(-29) = 1. Therefore, if we set y = 0, then x = 75, z = -29. Therefore, 99*75 + 144*0 + 256*(-29) = 1. Therefore, going back to the original equation, multiplying by 2 gives 198*75 + 288*0 + 512*(-29) = 2. Therefore, x = 75, y = 0, z = -29. 

Wait, so that's another solution. So here, y is 0, which might be simpler. Let me check if that works. 

Compute 198*75 + 288*0 + 512*(-29). 

First term: 198*75. Let me compute 200*75 - 2*75 = 15000 - 150 = 14850.

Second term: 0.

Third term: 512*(-29). Let me compute 512*30 = 15360, so 512*29 = 15360 - 512 = 14848. Therefore, with the negative sign: -14848.

Total is 14850 - 14848 = 2. Correct. 

So this is another solution: x = 75, y = 0, z = -29. 

So there are multiple solutions. The problem just asks for integers x, y, z, so either of these is acceptable. 

But maybe the question expects the minimal positive integers or something? But since it's not specified, either is okay. 

Alternatively, maybe even more simple solutions? Let me check. 

Alternatively, maybe we can find a solution with smaller numbers. Let me think. 

Alternatively, since 198 and 288 are both multiples of 18, and 512 is 2^9. So maybe we can think of 2 as 18*something + 512*something. Wait, but we already did that. 

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that 198 = 2*99, 288 = 2*144, 512 = 2*256. So 2 = 2*(99x + 144y + 256z). So 1 = 99x + 144y + 256z. 

Alternatively, think of 144 as 99 + 45. So 144 = 99 + 45. Not sure if that helps. 

Alternatively, maybe try to find some combination. Let me think. 

Suppose I take z = -1. Then 256*(-1) = -256. Then 99x + 144y = 1 + 256 = 257. So solving 99x + 144y = 257. Let me try to find integers x, y. 

Divide 257 by 99: 99*2 = 198, 257 - 198 = 59. So 99*2 + 144y = 257 => 144y = 257 - 198 = 59. 59 divided by 144 is not integer. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, take z = -2. Then 256*(-2) = -512. Then 99x + 144y = 1 + 512 = 513. So 99x + 144y = 513. Let me divide by 3: 33x + 48y = 171. Hmm, 33 and 48 have gcd 3. 171 is divisible by 3. So divide by 3: 11x + 16y = 57. Which is similar to what we had before. 

Earlier, we had 11a + 16b = 1. So here, 11x + 16y = 57. Let me solve this. 

We can write 57 = 11* something + 16* something. Let me try to find integers x, y. 

Let me use the extended Euclidean algorithm again. Since we know that 11*3 - 16*2 = 1. Therefore, multiplying by 57: 11*171 - 16*114 = 57. Therefore, x = 171, y = -114. Therefore, 11*171 + 16*(-114) = 57. Therefore, 33*171 + 48*(-114) = 513. Therefore, 99*171 + 144*(-114) = 513. Therefore, 99*171 + 144*(-114) + 256*(-2) = 1. Which is the same solution as before. 

Therefore, this is the same solution. 

Alternatively, maybe take z = 1. Then 256*1 = 256. Then 99x + 144y = 1 - 256 = -255. So solving 99x + 144y = -255. Let me divide by 3: 33x + 48y = -85. Then divide by gcd(33, 48). gcd(33, 48) is 3. But 85 is not divisible by 3. So no solution here. 

Alternatively, z = 0. Then 99x + 144y = 1. Let me check if that's possible. Since gcd(99, 144) is 9, and 1 is not divisible by 9. Therefore, no solution. 

So z cannot be 0. 

Alternatively, z = -1, which didn't work. z = -2 works. So that gives us the solution. 

Alternatively, maybe try z = -3. Then 256*(-3) = -768. Then 99x + 144y = 1 + 768 = 769. Let me check if 769 can be expressed as 99x + 144y. Let me try. 

Divide 769 by 99: 99*7 = 693, 769 - 693 = 76. So 99*7 + 144y = 769 => 144y = 769 - 693 = 76. 76 divided by 144 is not integer. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, z = -4. 256*(-4) = -1024. Then 99x + 144y = 1 + 1024 = 1025. Let me check. 1025 divided by 99 is 10*99 = 990, 1025 - 990 = 35. So 99*10 + 144y = 1025 => 144y = 35. Not integer. 

Alternatively, z = -5. 256*(-5) = -1280. Then 99x + 144y = 1 + 1280 = 1281. Let me divide by 3: 33x + 48y = 427. Then gcd(33, 48) is 3, but 427 divided by 3 is not integer. 

So maybe not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe try to find another solution. For example, the solution with y = 0, which we found earlier: x = 75, z = -29. Let me check if that's correct. 

So 99*75 + 256*(-29) = 1. Let me compute 99*75: 100*75 - 1*75 = 7500 - 75 = 7425. 256*(-29): 256*30 = 7680, so 256*29 = 7680 - 256 = 7424. Therefore, 7425 - 7424 = 1. Correct. 

So that's another solution. 

Therefore, there are multiple solutions. The problem doesn't specify any constraints, so either is acceptable. 

But maybe the question expects the solution with the smallest absolute values? Let me check. 

The first solution I found was x = 171, y = -114, z = -2. The second solution is x = 75, y = 0, z = -29. 

Comparing the absolute values: 

First solution: |171| + |-114| + |-2| = 171 + 114 + 2 = 287.

Second solution: |75| + |0| + |-29| = 75 + 0 + 29 = 104. So the second solution is better. 

Alternatively, maybe even better solutions? Let me think. 

Alternatively, let me try to find a solution with smaller numbers. Let me try to find another way. 

Let me think about the equation 99x + 144y + 256z = 1. Maybe I can find some combination where one of the variables is 0. 

We already have y = 0, giving x = 75, z = -29. What if I set x = 0? Then 144y + 256z = 1. Let me see if that's possible. 

gcd(144, 256) is 16, and 1 is not divisible by 16. Therefore, no solution. 

If I set z = 0, then 99x + 144y = 1. As before, gcd(99, 144) is 9, which doesn't divide 1. No solution. 

If I set x = 1, then 99 + 144y + 256z = 1 => 144y + 256z = -98. Divide by 2: 72y + 128z = -49. gcd(72, 128) is 8. 49 is not divisible by 8. No solution. 

x = -1: -99 + 144y + 256z = 1 => 144y + 256z = 100. Divide by 4: 36y + 64z = 25. gcd(36, 64) is 4. 25 not divisible by 4. No solution. 

x = 2: 198 + 144y + 256z = 1 => 144y + 256z = -197. Divide by... gcd(144, 256) is 16. -197 is not divisible by 16. 

x = -2: -198 + 144y + 256z = 1 => 144y + 256z = 199. gcd(144, 256)=16. 199 not divisible by 16. 

So maybe not helpful. 

Alternatively, trying to set y = 1. Then 99x + 144 + 256z = 1 => 99x + 256z = -143. Let me see if this is possible. 

Let me try to solve 99x + 256z = -143. Let me try to find integers x, z. 

Let me think. Let me try to solve for x: x = (-143 - 256z)/99. Let me try some z values. 

z = -1: x = (-143 - 256*(-1))/99 = (-143 + 256)/99 = 113/99. Not integer. 

z = -2: x = (-143 - 256*(-2))/99 = (-143 + 512)/99 = 369/99 = 123/33 = 41/11 ≈ 3.727. Not integer. 

z = -3: x = (-143 - 256*(-3))/99 = (-143 + 768)/99 = 625/99 ≈ 6.31. Not integer. 

z = -4: (-143 + 1024)/99 = 881/99 ≈ 8.9. Not integer. 

z = -5: (-143 + 1280)/99 = 1137/99 = 11.48... Not integer. 

z = -6: (-143 + 1536)/99 = 1393/99 ≈ 14.07. Not integer. 

z = -7: (-143 + 1792)/99 = 1649/99 ≈ 16.65. Not integer. 

Not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe trying z = 1: 99x + 256*1 = -143 => 99x = -143 - 256 = -399 => x = -399 / 99 = -133/33 ≈ -4.03. Not integer. 

z = 2: 99x + 512 = -143 => 99x = -655 => x = -655/99 ≈ -6.61. Not integer. 

Not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe trying y = -1. Then 99x + 144*(-1) + 256z = 1 => 99x + 256z = 1 + 144 = 145. So 99x + 256z = 145. Let me try to solve this. 

Let me try z = 0: 99x = 145. Not integer. 

z = 1: 99x + 256 = 145 => 99x = -111 => x = -111/99 = -37/33. Not integer. 

z = -1: 99x - 256 = 145 => 99x = 401 => x ≈ 4.05. Not integer. 

z = 2: 99x + 512 = 145 => 99x = -367 => x ≈ -3.7. Not integer. 

z = -2: 99x - 512 = 145 => 99x = 657 => x = 657 / 99 = 6.636... Not integer. 

z = 3: 99x + 768 = 145 => 99x = -623 => x ≈ -6.29. Not integer. 

Not helpful. 

So maybe the solution with y = 0 is the simplest. 

Therefore, the solution x = 75, y = 0, z = -29 is better. 

Alternatively, maybe even more simplified. Let me check if there are other solutions with smaller numbers. 

Alternatively, think of 256z = 1 - 99x - 144y. Let me try to find small integers. 

For example, let me try z = -1: 256*(-1) = -256. Then 99x + 144y = 1 + 256 = 257. Let me check if 257 can be expressed as 99x + 144y. 

Let me try x = 2: 99*2 = 198. 257 - 198 = 59. 59 / 144 is not integer. 

x = 1: 99 + 144y = 257 => 144y = 158. Not integer. 

x = 3: 297 + 144y = 257 => 144y = -40. Not integer. 

x = 0: 144y = 257. Not integer. 

x = -1: -99 + 144y = 257 => 144y = 356. 356 / 144 = 89/36 ≈ 2.47. Not integer. 

Not helpful. 

z = -2: 256*(-2) = -512. 99x + 144y = 1 + 512 = 513. Which we already solved earlier. 

z = -3: 256*(-3) = -768. 99x + 144y = 1 + 768 = 769. Let me try to find x and y. 

Let me try x = 7: 99*7 = 693. 769 - 693 = 76. 76 / 144 is not integer. 

x = 8: 792. 769 - 792 = -23. Not helpful. 

x = 6: 594. 769 - 594 = 175. 175 / 144 ≈ 1.21. Not integer. 

x = 5: 495. 769 - 495 = 274. 274 / 144 ≈ 1.89. Not integer. 

x = 4: 396. 769 - 396 = 373. Not divisible by 144. 

x = 9: 891. 769 - 891 = -122. Not helpful. 

Not helpful. 

So maybe the solution with z = -29 is the simplest. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find a solution with smaller numbers. 

But given that we already have two solutions, and the problem doesn't specify any constraints, I think either is acceptable. 

Therefore, the answer can be x = 75, y = 0, z = -29 or x = 171, y = -114, z = -2. 

But let me check if the problem expects the answer in a specific format. The problem says "Find integers x, y, z satisfying...". So either is acceptable. 

However, maybe the first solution I found is more straightforward? Or maybe the second one? 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the coefficients to be minimal in some sense. 

Alternatively, let me check if there are solutions with smaller absolute values. 

For example, let me think of the equation 99x + 144y + 256z = 1. 

Let me try to find a solution with z = -1, but that didn't work. 

Alternatively, maybe using the solution with z = -2, which gives x = 171, y = -114. But that's pretty big. 

Alternatively, maybe use the solution with y = 0, which is x = 75, z = -29. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to combine the two solutions? 

Alternatively, think of the equation 99x + 144y + 256z = 1. Let me think of 256z as something. 

Since 256 is 2^8, maybe I can find some combination. 

Alternatively, think of 99 and 144. Since 144 is 99 + 45. Let me try to find a combination. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the solution we found with y = 0, which is x = 75, z = -29. 

Alternatively, maybe I can find another solution by adding multiples of the coefficients. 

For example, since 99*75 + 256*(-29) = 1, then adding multiples of 256 and -99 to x and z. 

For example, if I add 256 to z, and subtract 99 from x, then 99*(75 - 1) + 256*(-29 + 1) = 99*74 + 256*(-28) = 99*74 + 256*(-28). Let me check if that equals 1. 

But since 99*75 + 256*(-29) = 1, then 99*(75 - k) + 256*(-29 + m) = 1. If I take k = 1 and m = 1, then 99*(75 - 1) + 256*(-29 + 1) = 99*74 + 256*(-28). Which is 1 - 99*1 + 256*1 = 1 - 99 + 256 = 1 + 157 = 158. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe find another solution by adding multiples. 

Alternatively, maybe not. 

Alternatively, since the problem doesn't specify any constraints, I can just present one of the solutions. 

Since the second solution (x = 75, y = 0, z = -29) is simpler, maybe that's the one to go with. 

But let me check if there's a solution with even smaller numbers. 

For example, let me try z = -2, which gives us 99x + 144y = 513. Earlier, we found x = 171, y = -114. But maybe there is a smaller solution. 

Let me try to find smaller x and y for 99x + 144y = 513. 

Divide by 3: 33x + 48y = 171. Divide by 3 again: 11x + 16y = 57. 

We had earlier that 11*3 - 16*2 = 1. Therefore, multiplying by 57: 11*171 - 16*114 = 57. Therefore, x = 171, y = -114. 

Alternatively, since 11x + 16y = 57, we can find other solutions by adding multiples of 16 to x and subtracting multiples of 11 from y. 

For example, general solution is x = 171 + 16k, y = -114 - 11k for integer k. 

So if I take k = -1, then x = 171 - 16 = 155, y = -114 +
