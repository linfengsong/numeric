Okay, so I need to solve these three Diophantine equations. Let me start with part (a): 56x + 72y = 40. Hmm, Diophantine equations are equations where we need integer solutions, right? So, first, I remember that for an equation like ax + by = c, there are solutions only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b divides c. Let me check that first.

For part (a), the coefficients are 56 and 72. Let me compute their gcd. Let's see, gcd(56, 72). Breaking them down into prime factors:

56 is 2^3 * 7, and 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. The common factors are 2^3, so gcd(56, 72) is 8. Then, check if 8 divides 40. Well, 40 divided by 8 is 5, so yes, it does. So there are solutions.

Now, to find all integer solutions, I need to find one particular solution and then express the general solution. Let me try to find one particular solution. Maybe using the extended Euclidean algorithm?

First, let me find gcd(56, 72) using the Euclidean algorithm:

72 divided by 56 is 1 with a remainder of 16 (since 56*1=56, 72-56=16).

Then, 56 divided by 16 is 3 with a remainder of 8 (16*3=48, 56-48=8).

Then, 16 divided by 8 is 2 with a remainder of 0. So the gcd is 8, which we already knew.

Now, let me work backwards to express 8 as a linear combination of 56 and 72.

Starting from 8 = 56 - 16*3.

But 16 is from the first step: 72 - 56*1. So substitute that in:

8 = 56 - (72 - 56*1)*3 = 56 - 72*3 + 56*3 = 56*(1 + 3) - 72*3 = 56*4 - 72*3.

So, 8 = 56*4 - 72*3. Therefore, multiplying both sides by 5 (since 8*5=40), we get:

40 = 56*20 - 72*15.

So, one particular solution is x=20, y=-15. Therefore, (x, y) = (20, -15) is a particular solution.

But wait, let me check that. Let me plug into the equation:

56*20 + 72*(-15) = 1120 - 1080 = 40. Yes, that works. Great.

Now, the general solution for equations of the form ax + by = c, once you have a particular solution (x0, y0), the general solution is given by:

x = x0 + (b/d)*t

y = y0 - (a/d)*t

where d is the gcd of a and b, and t is an integer.

So here, a=56, b=72, d=8. Therefore, the general solution is:

x = 20 + (72/8)*t = 20 + 9t

y = -15 - (56/8)*t = -15 - 7t

So, all integer solutions are given by x = 20 + 9t, y = -15 -7t for any integer t.

But let me check if that's correct. Let me pick t=0: x=20, y=-15, which works. Let me try t=1: x=29, y=-22. Let's compute 56*29 + 72*(-22). 56*29: 56*30=1680, minus 56 is 1624. 72*22=1584. So 1624 - 1584 = 40. Correct. Similarly, t=-1: x=20-9=11, y=-15+7= -8. 56*11=616, 72*(-8)= -576. 616 - 576 = 40. Correct. So that seems right.

Therefore, the solutions for part (a) are all integers (x, y) where x = 20 + 9t, y = -15 -7t for some integer t.

Now moving on to part (b): 24x + 138y = 18.

Again, first check if gcd(24, 138) divides 18.

Compute gcd(24, 138). Let's do the Euclidean algorithm.

138 divided by 24 is 5 with remainder 18 (24*5=120, 138-120=18).

Then 24 divided by 18 is 1 with remainder 6.

Then 18 divided by 6 is 3 with remainder 0. So gcd is 6.

Check if 6 divides 18. Yes, 18/6=3. So solutions exist.

Now, find a particular solution. Again, using extended Euclidean algorithm.

First, find gcd(24, 138) = 6.

Working backwards:

6 = 24 - 18*1

But 18 is from 138 - 24*5. Substitute:

6 = 24 - (138 - 24*5)*1 = 24 - 138 + 24*5 = 24*6 - 138*1.

Therefore, 6 = 24*6 - 138*1. Multiply both sides by 3 to get 18:

18 = 24*18 - 138*3.

Therefore, a particular solution is x=18, y=-3. Let me check:

24*18 + 138*(-3) = 432 - 414 = 18. Correct.

So general solution is:

x = x0 + (b/d)*t = 18 + (138/6)*t = 18 + 23t

y = y0 - (a/d)*t = -3 - (24/6)*t = -3 -4t

So general solutions are x=18 +23t, y=-3 -4t for integer t.

Let me check with t=0: x=18, y=-3. 24*18=432, 138*(-3)=-414. 432-414=18. Correct.

t=1: x=18+23=41, y=-3-4=-7. 24*41=984, 138*(-7)= -966. 984 - 966=18. Correct. t=-1: x=18-23=-5, y=-3+4=1. 24*(-5)=-120, 138*1=138. -120 + 138=18. Correct. So that works.

Therefore, part (b) solutions are x=18+23t, y=-3-4t for integers t.

Now part (c): 221x + 35y = 11.

Again, first check if gcd(221, 35) divides 11.

Compute gcd(221, 35). Let me do the Euclidean algorithm:

221 divided by 35 is 6 with remainder 11 (35*6=210, 221-210=11).

Then 35 divided by 11 is 3 with remainder 2 (11*3=33, 35-33=2).

Then 11 divided by 2 is 5 with remainder 1 (2*5=10, 11-10=1).

Then 2 divided by 1 is 2 with remainder 0. So gcd is 1. Since 1 divides 11, there are solutions.

So need to find a particular solution. Let me use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Starting from gcd(221, 35) = 1.

Working backwards:

1 = 11 - 2*5

But 2 is from 35 - 11*3. Substitute:

1 = 11 - (35 - 11*3)*5 = 11 - 35*5 + 11*15 = 11*16 - 35*5.

But 11 is from 221 - 35*6. Substitute:

1 = (221 - 35*6)*16 - 35*5 = 221*16 - 35*96 - 35*5 = 221*16 - 35*101.

Therefore, 1 = 221*16 - 35*101. Multiply both sides by 11 to get 11:

11 = 221*176 - 35*1111.

Therefore, a particular solution is x=176, y=-1111. Let me check:

221*176 + 35*(-1111). Hmm, let me compute 221*176 first. Maybe that's tedious, but let me check if there's a better way.

Alternatively, since we have 1 = 221*16 - 35*101, multiplying by 11 gives 11 = 221*176 - 35*1111. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, x=176, y=-1111 is a particular solution.

But maybe there's a smaller particular solution? Well, perhaps, but since we need to find the general solution, maybe we can just proceed with this.

But let me check if that works. Let me compute 221*176. Let me compute 221*176:

First, 221*100=22100, 221*70=15470, 221*6=1326. So total is 22100 + 15470 = 37570 + 1326 = 38896.

Then 35*(-1111) = -35*1111. Let me compute 35*1000=35000, 35*111=3885. So 35*1111=35000 + 3885 = 38885. Therefore, -38885. Then 38896 - 38885 = 11. Correct. So that works.

But maybe there's a simpler particular solution? Let me try to find one with smaller numbers. Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let me try solving the equation 221x + 35y = 11.

Alternatively, maybe I can solve for one variable. Let me try solving for y:

35y = 11 - 221x

So y = (11 - 221x)/35. So we need 11 - 221x divisible by 35. So 221x ≡ 11 mod 35.

Let me compute 221 mod 35. 35*6=210, so 221-210=11. So 221 ≡ 11 mod 35. Therefore, the equation becomes 11x ≡ 11 mod 35. So 11x ≡ 11 mod 35. Subtract 11: 11x - 11 ≡ 0 mod 35 => 11(x - 1) ≡ 0 mod 35.

Since gcd(11,35)=1, we can divide both sides by 11: x - 1 ≡ 0 mod 35 => x ≡ 1 mod 35. Therefore, x = 1 + 35k for some integer k.

Therefore, substituting back into the equation:

x = 1 + 35k. Then y = (11 - 221x)/35.

Let me compute that:

y = (11 - 221*(1 + 35k))/35 = [11 - 221 - 221*35k]/35 = (-210 - 221*35k)/35 = -210/35 - 221k = -6 - 221k.

Therefore, the general solution is x = 1 + 35k, y = -6 -221k for integer k.

Wait, that seems simpler. So why did I get a different particular solution earlier? Because there are infinitely many particular solutions, but this is a simpler one. So maybe I should use this approach.

So, in this case, the general solution is x = 1 + 35k, y = -6 -221k. Let me check with k=0: x=1, y=-6. Let me compute 221*1 + 35*(-6) = 221 - 210 = 11. Correct. So that's a valid solution.

Therefore, this is a better particular solution. So maybe I should have done that instead of the extended Euclidean algorithm. But either way, both methods lead to the general solution.

So, the general solution is x = 1 + 35k, y = -6 -221k, where k is any integer.

Alternatively, using the previous method where I found x=176, y=-1111. Let me see if that can be expressed in terms of this general solution.

If we take k such that 1 + 35k = 176. Then 35k = 175 => k=5. Then y = -6 -221*5 = -6 -1105 = -1111. Correct. So yes, that's consistent.

Therefore, the general solution is indeed x = 1 + 35k, y = -6 -221k. So that's the answer for part (c).

But let me check another value. Let me take k=1: x=1+35=36, y=-6-221=-227. Let me compute 221*36 + 35*(-227). 221*36: 200*36=7200, 21*36=756, total 7956. 35*(-227): Let me compute 35*227. 35*200=7000, 35*27=945, total 7945. So -7945. Then 7956 - 7945 = 11. Correct. So that works.

Therefore, part (c) solutions are x = 1 + 35k, y = -6 -221k for integers k.

So summarizing:

(a) 56x + 72y = 40: x = 20 + 9t, y = -15 -7t.

(b) 24x + 138y = 18: x = 18 +23t, y = -3 -4t.

(c) 221x + 35y = 11: x = 1 + 35k, y = -6 -221k.

But let me check if there's a way to write them more neatly or if there's any constraints. For example, in part (c), since the coefficients are large, but the general solution is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes people prefer to write the solutions in terms of the coefficients divided by the gcd, but since the gcd is 1 here, it's already simplified.

So, I think that's all. Let me check once again for part (c) if there's another way. For example, solving for x or y.

Alternatively, since 221 and 35 are coprime, the solutions are unique modulo 35 and 221 respectively. But since we have the general solution, that's already covered.

Yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the answers are as above.

**Final Answer**

(a) The integer solutions are $\boxed{x = 20 + 9t}$ and $\boxed{y = -15 - 7t}$ for all integers $t$.

(b) The integer solutions are $\boxed{x = 18 + 23t}$ and $\boxed{y = -3 - 4t}$ for all integers $t$.

(c) The integer solutions are $\boxed{x = 1 + 35t}$ and $\boxed{y = -6 - 221t}$ for all integers $t$.

But wait, the problem says "determine all solutions in the integers" and for each part, I need to present them boxed. However, the standard way is to present the general solution. However, sometimes for multiple variables, they might expect parametric forms. But since the user might expect each equation's solution in boxed format, maybe I need to check the instructions again.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "Determine all solutions in the integers of the following Diophantine equations: (a)... (b)... (c)...". The user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". But each equation has infinitely many solutions, so perhaps they need to present the general solution in boxed form. However, the standard way for Diophantine equations is to present the general solution with parameters. However, the user might expect for each part, the answer is given as parametric equations. But since the user might expect each part to have a boxed answer, but since they are parametric, perhaps they need to be written in a specific way.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects particular solutions? But no, Diophantine equations usually require general solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the answer in a specific format. For example, for part (a), the solutions can be written as all pairs (x, y) where x = 20 + 9t and y = -15 -7t. But how to box that?

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the answer in the form of equations with parameters. However, since the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", which is usually for a single expression. But since there are multiple variables, maybe each part is to be boxed as a parametric solution.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the answer in terms of the general solution, written as equations. However, given that the original instructions say "put your final answer within \boxed{}", perhaps I need to check if there's a standard way.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the solutions to be written as sets, but since they are infinite, that's not feasible. Alternatively, maybe for each equation, write the general solution in terms of parameters, boxed.

But in the context of the problem, since each equation is separate, perhaps each part should have its own boxed answer. However, since the solutions are parametric, perhaps writing them as:

For (a): $\boxed{x = 20 + 9t}$ and $\boxed{y = -15 - 7t}$

Similarly for (b) and (c). But I need to check the user's instructions again.

The original problem says: "Determine all solutions in the integers of the following Diophantine equations: (a)... (b)... (c)...". So, for each part, the answer is the set of solutions, which can be expressed parametrically. Since the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", maybe each part should have its own boxed answer. However, since there are two variables, perhaps the answer is written as two equations in boxes. But the standard practice in math problems is to present the general solution with parameters. However, since the user hasn't specified, but given that the original instructions say "put your final answer within \boxed{}", maybe I need to check.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the answer to be written in terms of the general solution with parameters, and each part is boxed. However, since there are two variables, perhaps for each part, the answer is given as two equations. But given that the user might expect separate boxed answers for each part, but each part has two variables.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the solutions in the form of equations with parameters, and each part is boxed as a system. However, since the platform might not allow multiple boxes, but given that the user hasn't specified, perhaps I need to follow the standard for such problems.

In many textbooks, the general solution is written with parameters. So for example, for part (a), the answer is all integers x and y such that x = 20 + 9t, y = -15 -7t. Therefore, in boxed form, perhaps:

(a) $\boxed{x = 20 + 9t}$ and $\boxed{y = -15 - 7t}$

But since the user might expect each equation to have its own box, but since the problem has three parts, each with two variables, maybe each part's answer is given with two boxed equations. However, the user might have intended for each part to have a single box, but that's not possible because there are two variables. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to write the general solution for each part with parameters, boxed as two equations. However, given that the user might have intended for each part to have its own boxed answer, but I need to check.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the answer in terms of the particular solution, but that's not the case. Since the question says "all solutions", which requires the general solution.

Therefore, I think the correct way is to present each part's general solution with parameters, boxed as two equations. But since I can only put one box per answer, maybe the user expects me to write each part's general solution in a single box, perhaps as a system.

But given that the user hasn't specified, but given that in the initial problem statement, each part is separate, and the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", maybe they expect each part to have its own boxed answer, even if it's multiple equations.

Alternatively, maybe for each part, write the general solution in terms of parameters, and box each part's solution. For example, for part (a), the answer is x = 20 + 9t, y = -15 -7t, so box each equation.

But since the instructions say "put your final answer within \boxed{}", maybe I need to check if there is a standard way here. For example, in some cases, people write the general solution as a single box with parameters. However, since there are two variables, perhaps writing them as two equations in the same box.

But since I can't be sure, but given that the user might expect separate boxed answers for each part, I will proceed as follows:

For each part, write the general solution with parameters, boxed. For example, for part (a):

(a) The solutions are $\boxed{x = 20 + 9t}$ and $\boxed{y = -15 - 7t}$ for all integers $t$.

Similarly for (b) and (c). However, since the user might expect each part to have a single box, but that's not feasible. Alternatively, since the original problem is in Chinese, maybe the user expects the answer to be written in a specific way. However, given that I can't be sure, but following the standard practice, I will present each part's general solution with parameters boxed as two equations.

Alternatively, since the user might have intended for the answer to be in the form of parametric equations, I think that's acceptable.

So, to conclude:

(a) $\boxed{x = 20 + 9t}$ and $\boxed{y = -15 - 7t}$

(b) $\boxed{x = 18 + 23t}$ and $\boxed{y = -3 - 4t}$

(c) $\boxed{x = 1 + 35t}$ and $\boxed{y = -6 - 221t}$

But I need to check if the user wants the answers in a specific format. However, given that the user hasn't specified, and given that each part has two variables, this seems appropriate.

**Final Answer**

(a) $\boxed{x = 20 + 9t}$ and $\boxed{y = -15 - 7t}$

(b) $\boxed{x = 18 + 23t}$ and $\boxed{y = -3 - 4t}$

(c) $\boxed{x = 1 + 35t}$ and $\boxed{y = -6 - 221t}$

To solve the given Diophantine equations, we apply the general method for solving linear Diophantine equations of the form $ ax + by = c $. The key steps involve:

1. **Checking for solvability**: The equation $ ax + by = c $ has integer solutions if and only if the greatest common divisor $ \gcd(a, b) $ divides $ c $.
2. **Finding a particular solution**: Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we express $ \gcd(a, b) $ as a linear combination of $ a $ and $ b $.
3. **Finding the general solution**: Once a particular solution $ (x_0, y_0) $ is found, the general solution is given by:
   $$
   x = x_0 + \frac{b}{\gcd(a, b)} \cdot t,\quad y = y_0 - \frac{a}{\gcd(a, b)} \cdot t
   $$
   where $ t \in \mathbb{Z} $.

### (a) $ 56x + 72y = 40 $

- $ \gcd(56, 72) = 8 $, and $ 8 \mid 40 $, so solutions exist.
- Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:
  $$
  8 = 56 \cdot 4 - 72 \cdot 3 \Rightarrow 40 = 56 \cdot 20 - 72 \cdot 15
  $$
  So, a particular solution is $ x_0 = 20 $, $ y_0 = -15 $.
- General solution:
  $$
  x = 20 + 9t,\quad y = -15 - 7t
  $$

### (b) $ 24x + 138y = 18 $

- $ \gcd(24, 138) = 6 $, and $ 6 \mid 18 $, so solutions exist.
- Extended Euclidean Algorithm gives:
  $$
  6 = 24 \cdot 6 - 138 \cdot 1 \Rightarrow 18 = 24 \cdot 18 - 138 \cdot 3
  $$
  So, a particular solution is $ x_0 = 18 $, $ y_0 = -3 $.
- General solution:
  $$
  x = 18 + 23t,\quad y = -3 - 4t
  $$

---

### (c) $ 221x + 35y = 11 $

- $ \gcd(221, 35) = 1 $, and $ 1 \mid 11 $, so solutions exist.
- Solving $ 221x \equiv 11 \pmod{35} $, we find $ x \equiv 1 \pmod{35} $, so $ x = 1 + 35t $.
- Substituting back:
  $$
  y = \frac{11 - 221x}{35} = \frac{11 - 221(1 + 35t)}{35} = -6 - 221t
  $$
- General solution:
  $$
  x = 1 + 35t,\quad y = -6 - 221t
  $$
