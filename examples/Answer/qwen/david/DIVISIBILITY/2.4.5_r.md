Okay, so I need to solve these two number theory problems. Let me start with part (a). The problem says that if a and b are positive integers with gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a^n, b^n) = 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them. So, if gcd(a, b) is 1, that means a and b are coprime, right? So they share no common divisors other than 1. Now, the question is about their nth powers. I need to show that their gcd is also 1.

Maybe I can use the property that if two numbers are coprime, then any power of them should also be coprime? But I need to verify this more formally. Let me recall that gcd(a^n, b^n) can be expressed in terms of gcd(a, b). Is there a formula or theorem that relates gcd(a^n, b^n) to gcd(a, b)?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if gcd(a, b) = 1, then there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = 1. But how does that help with the gcd of their powers?

Wait, perhaps I can use the property that gcd(a^n, b^n) = (gcd(a, b))^n? If that's true, then since gcd(a, b) is 1, then gcd(a^n, b^n) would be 1^n = 1. But is that formula correct?

Let me check with an example. Let a = 2, b = 3. gcd(2, 3) = 1. Then gcd(2^2, 3^2) = gcd(4, 9) = 1. That works. Another example: a = 3, b = 5. gcd(3^2, 5^2) = gcd(9, 25) = 1. Okay, seems to hold. But is this a general rule?

Wait, let me think. Suppose that gcd(a, b) = d. Then, a = d*a', b = d*b', where gcd(a', b') = 1. Then, a^n = d^n * (a')^n, and b^n = d^n * (b')^n. Therefore, gcd(a^n, b^n) = d^n * gcd(a'^n, b'^n). Since gcd(a', b') = 1, then gcd(a'^n, b'^n) = 1, because if there was a common divisor, it would have to divide both a' and b', which are coprime. Therefore, gcd(a^n, b^n) = d^n. Therefore, if gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a^n, b^n) = 1^n = 1. So that seems to be the case.

Therefore, part (a) is proven by this general formula. But maybe I need to explain this more carefully without referencing that formula? Let me try to do that.

Suppose that gcd(a, b) = 1. Let me assume that there is a prime p that divides both a^n and b^n. Then, p divides a^n and p divides b^n. If p divides a^n, then p divides a, because if a prime divides a power of a number, it must divide the original number. Similarly, p divides b. Therefore, p divides both a and b, which contradicts the fact that gcd(a, b) = 1. Therefore, there are no common prime factors between a^n and b^n, so their gcd must be 1. That seems like a solid proof.

Yes, that's another way to think about it. So, if there is a prime that divides both a^n and b^n, then it divides a and b, which can't happen. Therefore, gcd(a^n, b^n) is 1. That's a good proof. So part (a) is done.

Now moving on to part (b). The problem states that if a^n divides b^n, then a divides b. So, given that a^n | b^n, we need to show that a | b. Let me think about this.

First, let me recall that if a divides b, then there exists an integer k such that b = a*k. So, if a divides b, then b is a multiple of a. Now, the converse is that if a^n divides b^n, then a divides b. How can I show that?

Again, maybe using prime factorization? Let me think. Suppose that a and b are positive integers. Let me consider their prime factorizations. Let me write a as product of primes: a = p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ... * pk^ek. Similarly, b = p1^f1 * p2^f2 * ... * pk^fk * ... (other primes). But since a^n divides b^n, then for each prime in the factorization of a, the exponent in a^n is e_i * n, and in b^n it's f_i * n. Therefore, for each prime in a, we must have that e_i * n ≤ f_i * n, which implies e_i ≤ f_i. Therefore, in the prime factorization of b, each exponent is at least as big as in a. Therefore, a divides b, since each prime in a is present in b with at least the same exponent. Therefore, a divides b.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me check with an example. Let a = 2, b = 4. Then a^2 = 4 divides b^2 = 16. Indeed, 4 divides 16, and 2 divides 4. Another example: a = 2, b = 6. Then a^2 = 4 divides b^2 = 36. 4 divides 36? Wait, 36 divided by 4 is 9, which is an integer. So yes. And 2 divides 6. So that works. Another example: a = 3, b = 6. Then a^2 = 9 divides 36, which is 6^2. And 3 divides 6. What if a = 2, b = 8? Then 2^2 divides 8^2, which is 4 divides 64, yes. And 2 divides 8. What if a = 2, b = 1? Then a^2 = 4 divides 1^2 = 1? No, 4 doesn't divide 1. So that's a case where a^n doesn't divide b^n. So that's not a problem. But if a^n divides b^n, then a divides b.

But let me think about another case. Suppose a = 2, b = 4. Then a divides b. If a = 2, b = 6, then a divides b. What if a = 4, b = 8? Then 4 divides 8. So, if a^n divides b^n, then a divides b. So, the logic seems to hold.

But maybe I need to formalize this. Let me think again. Suppose that a^n divides b^n. Then, there exists an integer k such that b^n = a^n * k. Therefore, b = a * k^{1/n}. But since b is an integer, k must be a perfect nth power? Wait, not necessarily. Wait, if b is an integer, then k must be such that k^{1/n} is rational? Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, using prime factorization. Let me suppose that a and b are positive integers. Let me write a and b in terms of their prime factors. Let me suppose that a has prime factors p1, p2, ..., pr, and b has prime factors p1, p2, ..., pr, and possibly others. But since a^n divides b^n, then for each prime in the prime factorization of a, the exponent in a^n is n times the exponent in a, and in b^n it's n times the exponent in b. Therefore, for each prime in a, the exponent in b must be at least as big as in a. Therefore, when you take the prime factorization of b, it has exponents that are at least as big as those in a. Therefore, a divides b.

But wait, suppose that a has a prime factor that is not in b? Then, since a^n divides b^n, then that prime cannot be in b, because if a has a prime factor not in b, then a^n would have that prime factor, but b^n wouldn't, so a^n cannot divide b^n. Therefore, a and b must have the same prime factors. Therefore, for each prime in a, the exponent in b is at least as big as in a. Therefore, a divides b.

Therefore, the conclusion is that if a^n divides b^n, then a divides b. Therefore, part (b) is proven.

But let me check another example. Let a = 2, b = 4. Then 2^2 divides 4^2, and 2 divides 4. Another example: a = 3, b = 6. 3^2 divides 6^2, and 3 divides 6. What if a = 2, b = 2? Then 2^2 divides 2^2, and 2 divides 2. What if a = 1, b = 1? 1 divides 1. If a = 1, b = any number, then 1^n divides b^n, and 1 divides any number. So that's okay.

But what if a = 2, b = 3? Then 2^2 = 4 divides 3^2 = 9? No, 4 does not divide 9. So that's a case where the implication is vacuously true? Because the premise is false, so the implication holds. So the statement is that if a^n divides b^n, then a divides b. So if a^n does not divide b^n, the implication is still true. So that's okay.

Another example: Let a = 4, b = 2. Then 4^2 = 16 divides 2^2 = 4? No, 16 does not divide 4. Therefore, the premise is false, so the implication holds. But if a = 4, b = 8. Then 4^2 = 16 divides 8^2 = 64. Yes, 16 divides 64. And 4 divides 8. So that works.

So, in all these cases, the implication holds. Therefore, the proof via prime factorization seems solid.

Alternatively, maybe another approach. Suppose that a^n divides b^n. Then, there exists an integer k such that b^n = a^n * k. Then, taking the nth root, we get b = a * k^{1/n}. Since b is an integer, k^{1/n} must be rational. However, unless k is a perfect nth power, this might not hold. Wait, but k is an integer. So if k is a perfect nth power, then k^{1/n} is integer. But if k is not a perfect nth power, then k^{1/n} is irrational? Wait, but b is an integer. Therefore, k^{1/n} must be rational. However, if k is not a perfect nth power, then k^{1/n} is irrational. Therefore, the only way for b to be integer is if k is a perfect nth power. Therefore, k = m^n for some integer m. Therefore, b = a * m. Therefore, a divides b. Therefore, this shows that if a^n divides b^n, then a divides b. So that's another way to see it.

But is this correct? Let me check with an example. Suppose a = 2, b = 4. Then, b^n = 4^2 = 16, a^n = 4. Then k = 16 / 4 = 4. Which is 2^2, so m = 2. Therefore, b = a * m = 2 * 2 = 4. Correct. Another example: a = 2, b = 6. Then, b^2 = 36, a^2 = 4. Then k = 36 / 4 = 9, which is 3^2. So m = 3. Then b = a * m = 2 * 3 = 6. Correct. If a = 2, b = 8. Then k = 8^2 / 2^2 = 64 / 4 = 16 = 2^4. So m = 2^{4/2} = 2^2 = 4. Then b = 2 * 4 = 8. Correct. So that seems to work. Therefore, this approach also works.

But in this case, we have to assume that k is a perfect nth power. But how do we know that? Because if b is an integer, then k^{1/n} must be rational. However, if k is not a perfect nth power, then k^{1/n} is irrational. But since b is an integer, then k^{1/n} must be rational. Therefore, k must be a perfect nth power. Therefore, this is a valid approach.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that if a divides b, then a^n divides b^n. But here, the converse is being asked. So, if a^n divides b^n, then a divides b. Therefore, the converse is true. So, the problem is to show that this converse holds.

Therefore, both approaches seem valid. So, either using prime factorization or using the nth root argument. Therefore, part (b) is proven.

Wait, but maybe I need to be careful with the nth root approach. Suppose that a and b are positive integers. Then, if a^n divides b^n, then b = a * m, where m is an integer. But how do we know that m is an integer? Because if b^n = a^n * k, then b = a * k^{1/n}. But since b is an integer, k^{1/n} must be rational. However, k is an integer. Therefore, k must be a perfect nth power. Therefore, k = m^n, so b = a * m. Therefore, m is integer. Therefore, a divides b. Therefore, that's the proof.

But maybe another way: Let me suppose that a divides b. Then, there exists an integer m such that b = a * m. Then, b^n = (a * m)^n = a^n * m^n. Therefore, a^n divides b^n. Therefore, the converse is true. Therefore, if a^n divides b^n, then a divides b. Therefore, that's the contrapositive? Wait, no. The contrapositive would be if a does not divide b, then a^n does not divide b^n. But here, we are given that a^n divides b^n, so we need to show that a divides b. So, the reasoning is that if a^n divides b^n, then a divides b. Therefore, the proof is that if a^n divides b^n, then b is a multiple of a.

Therefore, both approaches are valid. So, I think that part (b) is proven.

But let me check another example where a and b are not coprime. For example, a = 2, b = 4. Then a^n divides b^n. And a divides b. If a = 4, b = 8. Then a divides b. If a = 6, b = 12. Then 6^2 divides 12^2, and 6 divides 12. So that works. What if a = 2, b = 6. Then 2^2 divides 6^2, and 2 divides 6. So that works. If a = 3, b = 6. 3^2 divides 6^2, and 3 divides 6. So that's okay.

Another example: a = 2, b = 2. Then 2^2 divides 2^2, and 2 divides 2. So that's okay. What if a = 1, b = 1? Then 1 divides 1. If a = 1, b = 5. Then 1^2 divides 5^2, and 1 divides 5. So that's okay. Therefore, seems like all cases work.

Therefore, I think both parts are proven. For part (a), using the fact that if a prime divides a^n and b^n, then it divides a and b, which contradicts gcd(a, b) = 1. For part (b), using prime factorization or the nth root argument, we can show that if a^n divides b^n, then a divides b.

So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{1}

(b) \boxed{a \mid b}
</think>

To solve the given number theory problems, we proceed with a clear and rigorous approach, using fundamental properties of greatest common divisors (gcd) and divisibility.

### **(a) If $ \gcd(a, b) = 1 $, then $ \gcd(a^n, b^n) = 1 $**

We are given that $ a $ and $ b $ are positive integers with $ \gcd(a, b) = 1 $, which means $ a $ and $ b $ are coprime — they share no common prime factors.

Suppose that $ \gcd(a^n, b^n) = d > 1 $. Then $ d $ must divide both $ a^n $ and $ b^n $. If $ d $ divides $ a^n $, then $ d $ must divide $ a $, because any prime factor of $ d $ must also divide $ a $. Similarly, if $ d $ divides $ b^n $, then $ d $ must divide $ b $.

This implies that $ d $ divides both $ a $ and $ b $, which contradicts the fact that $ \gcd(a, b) = 1 $. Therefore, no such $ d > 1 $ exists, and we conclude:

$$
\gcd(a^n, b^n) = 1
$$

**Final Answer for (a):** $\boxed{1}$

---

### **(b) If $ a^n \mid b^n $, then $ a \mid b $**

We are given that $ a^n $ divides $ b^n $, i.e., there exists an integer $ k $ such that:

$$
b^n = a^n \cdot k
$$

Taking the $ n $-th root of both sides, we get:

$$
b = a \cdot k^{1/n}
$$

Since $ b $ is an integer, the expression $ k^{1/n} $ must also be rational. However, the only way for this to be true is if $ k $ is a perfect $ n $-th power, say $ k = m^n $, where $ m $ is an integer. Then:

$$
b = a \cdot m
$$

This shows that $ b $ is a multiple of $ a $, and hence:

$$
a \mid b
$$

**Final Answer for (b):** $\boxed{a \mid b}$

---

### **Summary of Results**

- (a) If $ \gcd(a, b) = 1 $, then $ \gcd(a^n, b^n) = 1 $
- (b) If $ a^n \mid b^n $, then $ a \mid b $

Thus, the final answers are:

**(a)** $\boxed{1}$  
**(b)** $\boxed{a \mid b}$
