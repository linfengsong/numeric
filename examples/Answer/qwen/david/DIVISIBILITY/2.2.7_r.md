Okay, so I need to figure out how to prove this version of the Division Algorithm. The standard Division Algorithm says that for integers a and b (with b not zero), there are unique integers q and r such that a = qb + r, where 0 ≤ r < |b|. But here, the problem wants me to show that there are unique integers q and r such that a = qb + r, and the remainder r satisfies -1/2 |b| < r ≤ 1/2 |b|. Hmm, that's different from the usual remainder, which is non-negative. So this seems like a variation where the remainder can be negative, but it's bounded between -1/2 |b| and 1/2 |b|. 

First, let me recall the standard Division Algorithm. If we have a and b, then we can write a as qb + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder, with 0 ≤ r < |b|. The key here is that the remainder is non-negative and less than the absolute value of b. But in this problem, the remainder is allowed to be negative, but it's restricted to be within half of |b|. 

So maybe this is related to the concept of "balanced" remainders? Like, instead of having remainders that are always positive, we allow them to be negative but in a way that they are as close to zero as possible? For example, if b is positive, then the usual remainder is between 0 and b-1, but here it's between -b/2 and b/2. So for example, if b is 5, then the remainder would be between -2.5 and 2.5. Since r has to be an integer, that would mean r is between -2 and 2. So for a = 5q + r, r would be in {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}. But in the standard algorithm, r would be between 0 and 4. So this is a different way of dividing.

So the problem is to show that for any integers a and b (b ≠ 0), there exist unique integers q and r such that a = qb + r, and -1/2 |b| < r ≤ 1/2 |b|. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, maybe I can start by considering the standard division algorithm and then adjust the remainder to fit this new condition. Let me recall that in the standard algorithm, we have a = qb + r with 0 ≤ r < |b|. So if I can express r in terms of the standard remainder, maybe I can adjust it to fit the new bounds.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about how to find q and r such that r is in the interval (-|b|/2, |b|/2]. Let me consider that. Let me think about how to choose q such that r is in that interval.

Suppose I have a and b. Let me first consider the case where b is positive. If b is positive, then the standard remainder is between 0 and b-1. But here, the remainder is between -b/2 and b/2. So for example, if I have a number a, and I divide by b, the standard remainder is the smallest non-negative number less than b. But here, maybe we can adjust the quotient so that the remainder is in the middle?

Alternatively, maybe we can take the standard quotient and adjust it by 1 if the remainder is too big. Let me think.

Let me try to think of q as the quotient in the standard division algorithm. Let me denote the standard quotient as q0, and the standard remainder as r0, so that a = q0 b + r0, with 0 ≤ r0 < |b|. Then, if I want to adjust this to have a remainder in the interval (-|b|/2, |b|/2], maybe I can adjust q by 1 if r0 is greater than |b|/2. Wait, but since r0 is less than |b|, if |b| is even, then |b|/2 is an integer. If |b| is odd, then |b|/2 is not an integer. But since r0 is an integer, if |b| is even, then r0 can be up to |b| - 1, which is |b|/2 - 1 if |b| is even? Wait, no. If |b| is even, say |b| = 2k, then the standard remainder r0 is between 0 and 2k - 1. So if we want to have r in (-k, k], then if r0 is greater than k, then we can subtract b from a and increase the quotient by 1? Wait, maybe.

Let me take an example. Suppose b = 5 (so |b| = 5). Then the standard remainder r0 is between 0 and 4. The new remainder should be between -2.5 and 2.5. Since r has to be integer, it's between -2 and 2. So if the standard remainder is 3 or 4, then we can adjust by subtracting b (5) from a, which would mean subtracting 5 from a, which is equivalent to increasing the quotient by 1. For example, suppose a = 8. Then standard division would be q0 = 1, r0 = 3. But 3 is greater than 5/2 = 2.5. So we can adjust by subtracting 5 from a, which gives a = 3, and then q becomes 1 + 1 = 2, and r is 3 - 5 = -2. Which is within -2.5 < -2 ≤ 2.5. Similarly, if a = 9, standard division would be q0 = 1, r0 = 4. Then subtract 5, get a = 4, q = 2, r = -1. Which is within the range. If a = 7, standard division is q0 = 1, r0 = 2, which is within -2.5 < 2 ≤ 2.5. So that's okay. If a = 6, standard division is q0 = 1, r0 = 1, which is okay. If a = 5, q0 = 1, r0 = 0. If a = 4, q0 = 0, r0 = 4. Wait, but 4 is greater than 2.5. So we need to adjust. So here, if a = 4, then standard quotient is 0, remainder 4. But 4 is greater than 2.5, so we can subtract b (5) from a, which would be 4 - 5 = -1, and then q becomes 0 + 1 = 1, and r = -1. Which is within the range. So that works. 

So in general, if the standard remainder is greater than |b|/2, we can adjust the quotient by adding 1 and subtracting b from the remainder. Similarly, if the standard remainder is less than -|b|/2, but wait, in the standard division algorithm, the remainder is non-negative, so that can't happen. So in this case, the problem is only when the standard remainder is greater than |b|/2. So perhaps the idea is that if we take the standard quotient q0 and remainder r0, then if r0 > |b|/2, then we can set q = q0 + 1 and r = r0 - b. Then, since r0 - b would be negative, but we need to check if it's within the required range. 

But let me formalize this. Let me suppose that b is positive. Let me assume b > 0. Then, the standard division algorithm gives us a = q0 b + r0, with 0 ≤ r0 < b. Now, if r0 > b/2, then we can write a = (q0 + 1) b + (r0 - b). Then, since r0 - b is between -b and 0. But since r0 < b, then r0 - b < 0. Also, since r0 > b/2, then r0 - b > -b/2. Therefore, the new remainder is between -b/2 and 0. Which is within the required interval (-b/2, b/2]. Wait, but the upper bound is b/2. However, in this case, the remainder is between -b/2 and 0. So that's within the interval. 

Alternatively, if r0 ≤ b/2, then we can just take q = q0 and r = r0, which is within 0 ≤ r ≤ b/2 (since r0 < b, but if b is even, then b/2 is integer, and r0 can be up to b - 1, but if b is even, then b/2 is half of b. Wait, but if b is even, say b = 2k, then the standard remainder r0 is between 0 and 2k - 1. If r0 ≤ k, then it's within the desired range. If r0 > k, then we adjust. So in this case, the adjusted remainder would be between -k and 0. 

So in general, regardless of whether b is even or odd, if we take the standard quotient and remainder, and adjust the quotient if the remainder is greater than b/2, then we get a remainder in (-b/2, b/2]. 

But how do we know that this adjusted remainder is unique? Also, what about when b is negative? Because the problem says that b is an integer not equal to zero, so it can be positive or negative. 

So maybe I need to handle the case when b is positive and when b is negative. Let me first assume that b is positive. Then, as above, we can adjust the remainder. Now, if b is negative, let's say b = -c where c > 0. Then, the equation a = q b + r becomes a = q (-c) + r. Let me rearrange that: a = -q c + r. Which is equivalent to a = (-q) c + r. So if I think of this as dividing a by c (since b is -c), then the standard division algorithm would give me a = q' c + r', with 0 ≤ r' < c. But in this case, the equation is a = (-q) c + r. So maybe I can adjust the quotient accordingly. 

Alternatively, maybe I can just take absolute values. Since the problem is symmetric in b, because if I replace b with -b, then the condition on r would be the same. Because -1/2 |b| < r ≤ 1/2 |b|. So if b is negative, then |b| is positive, so the same condition applies. Therefore, maybe I can assume without loss of generality that b is positive. Because if b is negative, then we can write it as b = -|b|, and then proceed as before. 

Therefore, maybe I can assume b > 0, and then the result would hold for any integer b ≠ 0. 

So let me proceed under the assumption that b is positive. Then, as per the standard division algorithm, there exist unique integers q0 and r0 such that a = q0 b + r0, with 0 ≤ r0 < b. Now, we need to adjust this to get r in (-b/2, b/2]. 

So, if r0 ≤ b/2, then we can take q = q0 and r = r0. If r0 > b/2, then we can take q = q0 + 1 and r = r0 - b. 

But we need to check that this gives us a unique solution. Also, we need to ensure that this is the only way to write a as qb + r with r in that interval. 

So let me check uniqueness. Suppose that there are two pairs (q1, r1) and (q2, r2) such that a = q1 b + r1 = q2 b + r2, with -b/2 < r1, r2 ≤ b/2. Then, we have (q1 - q2) b = r2 - r1. Since r1 and r2 are both in (-b/2, b/2], the difference r2 - r1 is in (-b, b]. Therefore, (q1 - q2) b is in (-b, b]. Therefore, (q1 - q2) must be 0 or ±1. Because if (q1 - q2) is 0, then r2 - r1 = 0, so r1 = r2. If (q1 - q2) is 1, then b = r2 - r1. But since r2 - r1 ≤ b/2 - (-b/2) = b. So if (q1 - q2) = 1, then b = r2 - r1. But since r2 - r1 ≤ b, and r2 - r1 must be equal to b. However, since r2 ≤ b/2 and r1 > -b/2, then r2 - r1 ≤ b/2 - (-b/2) = b. But for equality, we need r2 = b/2 and r1 = -b/2. However, in this case, since r1 must be greater than -b/2, so r1 can't be equal to -b/2. Therefore, r2 - r1 can't be equal to b. Therefore, (q1 - q2) can't be 1. Similarly, if (q1 - q2) = -1, then -b = r2 - r1. But since r2 - r1 ≥ -b/2 - b/2 = -b. Therefore, equality would require r2 = -b/2 and r1 = b/2. But again, r1 must be less than b/2 (since r1 ≤ b/2, but in the original problem statement, the upper bound is inclusive. Wait, the problem says -1/2 |b| < r ≤ 1/2 |b|. So for r, the upper bound is inclusive, but the lower bound is exclusive. Therefore, r can be equal to b/2, but not equal to -b/2. Therefore, if r2 - r1 = -b, then r2 = -b/2 and r1 = b/2. But r1 can be equal to b/2? Wait, if b is even, then b/2 is an integer. For example, if b = 2, then r can be up to 1. So if b is even, then r can be exactly b/2. However, the lower bound is -b/2 < r. So if b is even, then r can be -b/2 + ε, but not exactly -b/2. Therefore, in this case, if r2 = -b/2 and r1 = b/2, then r2 - r1 = -b. But since r1 can be equal to b/2, but r2 cannot be equal to -b/2. Therefore, in this case, (q1 - q2) can't be -1. Therefore, the only possibility is that q1 = q2 and r1 = r2. Therefore, the representation is unique. 

Therefore, this shows that the representation is unique. Therefore, if we take the standard quotient q0 and remainder r0, then adjust q and r as needed, we get a unique representation. 

But I need to make sure that this adjustment is valid. Let me check with an example. Let's take b = 5, a = 8. Standard division: q0 = 1, r0 = 3. Since 3 > 5/2 = 2.5, we adjust q to 2, r to 3 - 5 = -2. Then, 2*5 + (-2) = 10 - 2 = 8. Correct. Another example: a = 4, b = 5. Standard division: q0 = 0, r0 = 4. Since 4 > 2.5, adjust q to 1, r to 4 - 5 = -1. Then 1*5 + (-1) = 5 - 1 = 4. Correct. 

Another example: a = 2, b = 5. Standard division: q0 = 0, r0 = 2. Since 2 ≤ 2.5, we don't adjust. So q = 0, r = 2. Which is within the range. 

If a = 7, b = 5. Standard division: q0 = 1, r0 = 2. Which is within the range. 

If a = 3, b = 5. q0 = 0, r0 = 3. Which is greater than 2.5, so adjust to q = 1, r = 3 - 5 = -2. Which is within the range. 

So that seems to work. 

Now, let me check for b negative. Let me take b = -5. Then, |b| = 5. So the remainder r must satisfy -2.5 < r ≤ 2.5. So r can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. 

Let me take a = 8. Then, we need to find q and r such that 8 = q*(-5) + r, with -2.5 < r ≤ 2.5. Let me solve for q. 

Let me rearrange: 8 = -5q + r => r = 8 + 5q. 

We need r to be between -2.5 and 2.5. So:

-2.5 < 8 + 5q ≤ 2.5

Subtract 8:

-10.5 < 5q ≤ -5.5

Divide by 5:

-2.1 < q ≤ -1.1

Since q must be integer, the only integer in this interval is q = -2. 

Then, r = 8 + 5*(-2) = 8 - 10 = -2. Which is within the range. 

Alternatively, let's check if this is the unique solution. Suppose we take q = -2, r = -2. 

Another way: if we use the standard division algorithm for b = -5, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since b is negative, we can take absolute value and proceed as before. Let me think. 

If b is negative, then |b| is positive. Let me write b = -c where c > 0. Then, the equation is a = q*(-c) + r => a = -q c + r. Which can be rewritten as a = (-q) c + r. So if I think of this as dividing a by c, then the standard division algorithm would give me a = q' c + r', where 0 ≤ r' < c. But here, we have a = (-q) c + r. Therefore, if I set q' = -q, then a = q' c + r. Therefore, the standard division algorithm would give me q' and r', so that a = q' c + r', with 0 ≤ r' < c. Therefore, if I take q = -q', then the equation becomes a = -q' c + r = q*(-c) + r. Therefore, if I take q as -q', then the remainder is r. But in this case, the remainder r is r', which is between 0 and c - 1. However, in our problem, we want the remainder r to be between -c/2 and c/2. Therefore, if r' is between 0 and c - 1, then if r' > c/2, we can adjust q by adding 1 and subtracting c from r'. 

Wait, so this seems similar to the case when b is positive. Therefore, if we take the standard division algorithm for a divided by c (which is |b|), then adjust the remainder if it's greater than c/2, then we can get the desired remainder. 

Therefore, if we take b negative, then we can convert it to positive, do the same process, and then the remainder will be in the required range. 

Therefore, regardless of the sign of b, we can adjust the quotient and remainder accordingly. 

Therefore, the key idea is that for any integer a and non-zero integer b, we can take the standard quotient and remainder, and adjust the quotient if the remainder is too large, thereby moving the remainder into the desired interval. 

Now, to formalize this, let me try to write a proof.

First, let me consider the case when b > 0. Then, by the standard division algorithm, there exist unique integers q0 and r0 such that a = q0 b + r0 with 0 ≤ r0 < b. Now, if r0 ≤ b/2, then we can take q = q0 and r = r0. If r0 > b/2, then we can take q = q0 + 1 and r = r0 - b. 

We need to check that in both cases, r satisfies -b/2 < r ≤ b/2. 

Case 1: r0 ≤ b/2. Then, since r0 ≥ 0, we have 0 ≤ r0 ≤ b/2. Therefore, -b/2 < 0 ≤ r0 ≤ b/2. Therefore, this satisfies the condition. 

Case 2: r0 > b/2. Then, we take q = q0 + 1, r = r0 - b. Since r0 < b (from the standard division algorithm), then r = r0 - b < 0. Also, since r0 > b/2, then r = r0 - b > b/2 - b = -b/2. Therefore, -b/2 < r < 0. Since r must be an integer, and -b/2 < r ≤ b/2, this is within the required range. 

Therefore, in both cases, we have that r is in (-b/2, b/2]. 

Now, uniqueness. Suppose there are two pairs (q1, r1) and (q2, r2) such that a = q1 b + r1 = q2 b + r2, with -b/2 < r1, r2 ≤ b/2. Then, (q1 - q2) b = r2 - r1. 

Since r1 and r2 are in (-b/2, b/2], the difference r2 - r1 is in (-b, b]. Therefore, (q1 - q2) b is in (-b, b]. Therefore, (q1 - q2) must be 0 or ±1. 

Case 1: q1 - q2 = 0. Then, r2 - r1 = 0, so r1 = r2. 

Case 2: q1 - q2 = 1. Then, b = r2 - r1. But since r2 ≤ b/2 and r1 > -b/2, then r2 - r1 ≤ b/2 - (-b/2) = b. However, since r1 > -b/2, then r2 - r1 < b/2 - (-b/2) = b. Therefore, r2 - r1 < b. But b = r2 - r1, so this would require that r2 - r1 is equal to b, but since r2 - r1 < b, this is impossible. Therefore, q1 - q2 cannot be 1. 

Case 3: q1 - q2 = -1. Then, -b = r2 - r1. Therefore, r2 - r1 = -b. Then, since r2 ≤ b/2 and r1 > -b/2, then r2 - r1 ≤ b/2 - (-b/2) = b. But here, we have r2 - r1 = -b, which would require that r2 = -b/2 and r1 = b/2. However, in the original problem, the remainder r must satisfy -b/2 < r ≤ b/2. Therefore, r1 cannot be equal to b/2 (since the lower bound is exclusive for -b/2, but upper bound is inclusive). Wait, the problem says -1/2 |b| < r ≤ 1/2 |b|. So the upper bound is inclusive, but the lower bound is exclusive. Therefore, r1 can be equal to b/2, but r1 cannot be equal to -b/2. Therefore, if r2 - r1 = -b, then r2 = -b/2 and r1 = b/2. However, r2 cannot be equal to -b/2. Therefore, this case is impossible. Therefore, q1 - q2 cannot be -1. 

Therefore, the only possibility is q1 = q2 and r1 = r2. Therefore, the representation is unique. 

Therefore, this proves the existence and uniqueness for b > 0. 

Now, for b < 0, let me consider b = -c where c > 0. Then, we can write a = q b + r = q (-c) + r = -q c + r. We need to find integers q and r such that -c/2 < r ≤ c/2. 

But this is equivalent to the case when we divide a by c, with the remainder in (-c/2, c/2]. Therefore, by the above argument, we can perform the same steps. 

Alternatively, we can think of it as follows: Let me take the absolute value of b, which is c = |b|. Then, the problem reduces to the case when b is positive, as we did before. Therefore, by the previous proof, there exists unique integers q' and r' such that a = q' c + r', with -c/2 < r' ≤ c/2. Then, since b = -c, we can write a = q' (-c) + r' = -q' c + r'. Therefore, if we set q = -q', then a = q b + r'. Therefore, this gives us the desired representation. 

Therefore, for b < 0, we can use the same reasoning. 

Therefore, in both cases, whether b is positive or negative, we can find unique integers q and r such that a = qb + r with -|b|/2 < r ≤ |b|/2. 

Therefore, this completes the proof. 

But let me check for b negative with an example. Let me take b = -5, a = 8. Then, as before, we found q = -2, r = -2. Let me check if this is the unique solution. Suppose there is another pair q', r' such that 8 = q' (-5) + r', with -2.5 < r' ≤ 2.5. So, 8 = -5 q' + r'. Then, r' = 8 + 5 q'. 

We need -2.5 < 8 + 5 q' ≤ 2.5. 

So, subtract 8: -10.5 < 5 q' ≤ -5.5 

Divide by 5: -2.1 < q' ≤ -1.1 

Therefore, the only integer q' is -2. Therefore, r' = 8 + 5*(-2) = 8 - 10 = -2. Therefore, unique. 

Another example: a = 3, b = -5. Then, 3 = -5 q' + r', with -2.5 < r' ≤ 2.5. So, r' = 3 + 5 q'. 

So, -2.5 < 3 + 5 q' ≤ 2.5 

Subtract 3: -5.5 < 5 q' ≤ -0.5 

Divide by 5: -1.1 < q' ≤ -0.1 

Therefore, q' = -1. Then, r' = 3 + 5*(-1) = 3 - 5 = -2. Which is within the range. 

Alternatively, if we use the standard division algorithm for a divided by c = 5. So a = 3, c = 5. Then, standard division gives q0 = 0, r0 = 3. Since 3 > 5/2 = 2.5, we adjust q to 0 + 1 = 1, r = 3 - 5 = -2. Therefore, in terms of b = -5, we have q = -q' = -1, r = -2. Which is the same as above. 

Therefore, this seems to work. 

Another example: a = -3, b = -5. Then, we need to find q and r such that -3 = q*(-5) + r, with -2.5 < r ≤ 2.5. 

So, rearranged: r = -3 + 5 q. 

So, -2.5 < -3 + 5 q ≤ 2.5 

Add 3: 0.5 < 5 q ≤ 5.5 

Divide by 5: 0.1 < q ≤ 1.1 

Therefore, q = 1. Then, r = -3 + 5*1 = 2. Which is within the range. 

Alternatively, using the standard division algorithm. Let me take c = 5, and a = -3. Then, standard division would be q0 = -1, r0 = 2 (since -3 = (-1)*5 + 2). Then, since r0 = 2 ≤ 2.5, we don't adjust. Therefore, q' = -1, r' = 2. Then, since b = -5, q = -q' = 1, r = r' = 2. Which matches the previous result. 

Therefore, this seems to work. 

Therefore, the proof holds for both positive and negative b. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that for any integers a and b (b ≠ 0), there exist unique integers q and r such that a = qb + r, where -|b|/2 < r ≤ |b|/2. 

Therefore, this version of the Division Algorithm is valid. 

I think this covers all cases. The key steps were considering the standard division algorithm, adjusting the quotient when the remainder is too large, and proving uniqueness by showing that any two representations would imply the same quotient and remainder. Also, handling both positive and negative b by considering absolute values. 

I need to make sure that I didn't miss any edge cases. For example, when b = 1, then the remainder must be between -0.5 and 0.5. Since r must be integer, the only possible value is 0. Therefore, for any a, we have a = q*1 + 0, so q = a. Which is correct. 

Another edge case: b = 2. Then the remainder must be between -1 and 1. So possible remainders are -1, 0, 1. Let me take a = 1. Then, standard division would be q0 = 0, r0 = 1. Since 1 is equal to 2/2, which is the upper bound. Therefore, we can take r = 1. Alternatively, if we adjust, but since the upper bound is inclusive, we don't need to adjust. Therefore, q = 0, r = 1. 

If a = 2, standard division is q0 = 1, r0 = 0. Which is within the range. 

If a = 3, standard division is q0 = 1, r0 = 1. Which is within the range. 

If a = 4, standard division is q0 = 2, r0 = 0. 

If a = -1, b = 2. Then, standard division would be q0 = -1, r0 = 1 (since -1 = (-1)*2 + 1). But 1 is within the range. Alternatively, if we wanted to adjust, but since r0 = 1 ≤ 1, we don't need to adjust. 

Alternatively, if we take q = -1, r = 1. 

Alternatively, could we have q = -2, r = -1? Let's check: -2*2 + (-1) = -4 -1 = -5 ≠ -1. So no. Therefore, unique. 

Therefore, this seems to hold. 

Another case: b = 3. Then, remainder must be between -1.5 and 1.5, so possible remainders are -1, 0, 1. 

Take a = 2. Standard division: q0 = 0, r0 = 2. Since 2 > 1.5, adjust q to 1, r = 2 - 3 = -1. Which is within the range. 

Therefore, a = 1*3 + (-1) = 3 -1 = 2. Correct. 

Therefore, this seems to work. 

Therefore, I think the proof is correct. 

**Final Answer**
The unique integers $ q $ and $ r $ satisfying the given conditions are guaranteed by the Division Algorithm, so the answer is \boxed{q} and \boxed{r} as per the problem's requirement. However, since the problem asks to obtain the version of the Division Algorithm, the final answer is the existence and uniqueness of such $ q $ and $ r $, which is confirmed. But since the problem says "Obtain the following version of the Division Algorithm", the final answer is the statement that such integers exist and are unique, so the boxed answer is likely indicating the form of the equation, but since the problem is to show the existence and uniqueness, the answer is simply the confirmation. However, the user might expect the final answer to be boxed as per the problem's instruction. But since the problem is to "obtain the version", the answer is the statement that for integers $ a $ and $ b $, there exist unique integers $ q $ and $ r $ such that $ a = qb + r $ with $ -\frac{1}{2}|b| < r \leq \frac{1}{2}|b| $. Therefore, the final answer is the confirmation of this statement, which is already proven, so the boxed answer is not a specific value but the statement itself. However, since the user might expect a boxed answer, but in the original problem, the user says "Obtain the following version of the Division Algorithm", so the answer is the existence and uniqueness, which is already shown. However, since the user might expect the answer to be the equation, but the question is to obtain the version, not to compute specific values. Therefore, the correct final answer is the statement that such integers exist and are unique, which is already proven. But in the context of the user's instruction, they might expect the answer to be the equation, but since the problem is to show the existence, perhaps the answer is just the confirmation. However, given that the user might have expected the answer to be boxed, but since it's a proof, perhaps the answer is just confirming the statement. However, in the original problem, the user says "Obtain the following version of the Division Algorithm", so the answer is the statement that for integers $ a $ and $ b $, there exist unique integers $ q $ and $ r $ satisfying $ a = qb + r $ with $ -\frac{1}{2}|b| < r \leq \frac{1}{2}|b| $. Therefore, the final answer is the confirmation of this statement, which is already done. However, since the user might expect the answer to be boxed as per instructions, but the problem is to show the existence, not to compute a specific value. Therefore, the final answer is the confirmation of the statement, which is the version of the Division Algorithm, so the answer is:

\boxed{a = qb + r \text{ with } -\frac{1}{2}|b| < r \leq \frac{1}{2}|b|}

But since the user might expect a different format, but given the instructions, I think that's the appropriate way to present it. However, in many cases, such problems expect the answer to be the statement that the division algorithm holds with those conditions, so the boxed answer is as above. However, since the user might have wanted the answer to be the existence and uniqueness, but since the problem says "obtain the following version", which is the statement itself, so the boxed answer is the equation with the remainder condition.

To obtain the version of the **Division Algorithm** where for integers $ a $ and $ b $ (with $ b \neq 0 $), there exist **unique integers** $ q $ and $ r $ such that:

$$
a = qb + r, \quad \text{with} \quad -\frac{1}{2}|b| < r \leq \frac{1}{2}|b|,
$$

we proceed by analyzing the structure of the division process and leveraging the **standard Division Algorithm**, which guarantees that for any integers $ a $ and $ b \neq 0 $, there exist unique integers $ q_0 $ and $ r_0 $ such that:

$$
a = q_0 b + r_0, \quad \text{with} \quad 0 \leq r_0 < |b|.
$$

### Step 1: Adjusting the Remainder

We aim to adjust the remainder $ r_0 $ to fall within the range $ -\frac{1}{2}|b| < r \leq \frac{1}{2}|b| $. This is a **balanced remainder** version of the algorithm.

Let’s consider the standard remainder $ r_0 $. If:

- $ r_0 \leq \frac{1}{2}|b| $, then we can take $ q = q_0 $ and $ r = r_0 $.
- If $ r_0 > \frac{1}{2}|b| $, then we adjust by increasing the quotient by 1 and subtracting $ b $ from the remainder:

$$
q = q_0 + 1, \quad r = r_0 - b.
$$

This adjustment ensures that the new remainder $ r = r_0 - b $ satisfies:

$$
-\frac{1}{2}|b| < r \leq \frac{1}{2}|b|.
$$

Let’s verify this:

- Since $ r_0 < |b| $, then $ r = r_0 - b < 0 $.
- Since $ r_0 > \frac{1}{2}|b| $, then $ r = r_0 - b > \frac{1}{2}|b| - |b| = -\frac{1}{2}|b| $.

Hence, the new remainder is in the desired range.

### Step 2: Uniqueness

Suppose there are two such pairs $ (q_1, r_1) $ and $ (q_2, r_2) $ that satisfy:

$$
a = q_1 b + r_1 = q_2 b + r_2, \quad \text{with} \quad -\frac{1}{2}|b| < r_1, r_2 \leq \frac{1}{2}|b|.
$$

Then:

$$
(q_1 - q_2)b = r_2 - r_1.
$$

Since $ -\frac{1}{2}|b| < r_1, r_2 \leq \frac{1}{2}|b| $, we have:

$$
-|b| < r_2 - r_1 < |b|.
$$

Therefore, the only possible integer values for $ q_1 - q_2 $ are $ 0 $ or $ \pm 1 $.

- If $ q_1 - q_2 = 0 $, then $ r_1 = r_2 $.
- If $ q_1 - q_2 = \pm 1 $, then $ r_2 - r_1 = \pm b $, which is not possible since $ r_2 - r_1 < b $.

Thus, the representation is **unique**.

### Step 3: Handling Negative Values of $ b $

If $ b < 0 $, we can write $ b = -c $ with $ c > 0 $, and the same logic applies. The remainder condition becomes:

$$
-\frac{1}{2}c < r \leq \frac{1}{2}c.
$$

The standard division algorithm still holds, and the same adjustments apply. Hence, the result is valid for all $ b \neq 0 $.

---

### Final Conclusion

We have shown that for any integers $ a $ and $ b \neq 0 $, there exist **unique integers** $ q $ and $ r $ such that:

$$
a = qb + r, \quad \text{with} \quad -\frac{1}{2}|b| < r \leq \frac{1}{2}|b|.
$$

This is a valid and unique version of the Division Algorithm.

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{a = qb + r \text{ with } -\frac{1}{2}|b| < r \leq \frac{1}{2}|b|}
$$
