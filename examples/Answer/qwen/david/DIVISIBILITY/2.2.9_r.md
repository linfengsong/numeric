Okay, so I need to verify that any integer that is both a square and a cube must be congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 7. The example given is 64, which is 8 squared and 4 cubed, and 64 divided by 7 is 9 with a remainder of 1, so 64 ≡ 1 mod 7. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, if a number is both a square and a cube, then it must be a sixth power. Because the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. So, any number that is a square and a cube is a sixth power. So, let me write that down. Let’s say n = a^6 for some integer a. Then, n is a square because a^6 = (a^3)^2, and it's a cube because a^6 = (a^2)^3. So that checks out.

Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that any sixth power is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 7. So, I need to check for any integer a, what is a^6 mod 7. Then, see if it's always 0 or 1.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Fermat's little theorem here. Fermat's little theorem says that if p is a prime, then for any integer a not divisible by p, a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p. Since 7 is prime, then for any a not divisible by 7, a^6 ≡ 1 mod 7. And if a is divisible by 7, then a^6 ≡ 0 mod 7. Therefore, a^6 mod 7 is either 0 or 1. Therefore, any sixth power is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 7. Therefore, the conclusion follows.

Wait, but let me check this with some examples. Let me take a few numbers and compute their sixth powers modulo 7.

First, take a = 0: 0^6 = 0 mod 7. So that's 0.

a = 1: 1^6 = 1 mod 7. So 1.

a = 2: 2^6. Let me compute 2^6. 2^2 is 4, 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 64 divided by 7 is 9*7=63, so 64-63=1. So 64 ≡ 1 mod 7. So 2^6 ≡ 1 mod 7.

a = 3: 3^6. Let me compute 3^2=9≡2 mod7, 3^3=3*2=6 mod7, 3^4=3*6=18≡4 mod7, 3^5=3*4=12≡5 mod7, 3^6=3*5=15≡1 mod7. So again 1.

a=4: 4^6. Let me compute 4^2=16≡2 mod7, 4^3=4*2=8≡1 mod7, 4^4=4*1=4 mod7, 4^5=4*4=16≡2 mod7, 4^6=4*2=8≡1 mod7. Again 1.

a=5: 5^6. Let me compute 5^2=25≡4 mod7, 5^3=5*4=20≡6 mod7, 5^4=5*6=30≡2 mod7, 5^5=5*2=10≡3 mod7, 5^6=5*3=15≡1 mod7. So again 1.

a=6: 6^6. Let me compute 6^2=36≡1 mod7, 6^3=6*1=6 mod7, 6^4=6*6=36≡1 mod7, 6^5=6*1=6 mod7, 6^6=6*6=36≡1 mod7. So again 1.

So for all a from 0 to 6, their sixth powers modulo 7 are either 0 or 1. Therefore, indeed, any sixth power is congruent to 0 or 1 mod7. Therefore, if a number is both a square and a cube, it is a sixth power, hence must be congruent to 0 or 1 mod7. Therefore, the statement is verified.

But wait, let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using modular arithmetic properties.

Alternatively, since we know that for any integer a, a^6 ≡ 0 or 1 mod7. Because if a is divisible by 7, then a^6 is 0 mod7. If not, then by Fermat's little theorem, a^6 ≡ 1 mod7. Therefore, that's the reasoning.

But maybe I should check if there's a case where a^6 could be something else. For example, suppose a is 7k + r, where r is 1,2,3,4,5,6. Then, a^6 mod7 would be r^6 mod7. Which we already saw for r=1,...,6, r^6 ≡1 mod7. So that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe using Euler's theorem? Since φ(7)=6, so for any a coprime to 7, a^6 ≡1 mod7. Therefore, that's exactly Fermat's little theorem. So that's the same thing.

Therefore, the conclusion is that all sixth powers are congruent to 0 or 1 mod7. Therefore, numbers that are both squares and cubes (i.e., sixth powers) must be congruent to 0 or 1 mod7. Therefore, the statement is verified.

But let me check with some examples. For example, 64 is 8^2=4^3, which is 64. 64 divided by 7 is 9*7=63, 64-63=1, so 64≡1 mod7. Another example: 0 is 0^6, which is 0 mod7. 1 is 1^6, which is 1 mod7. 64 is 1 mod7. What about 7^6? That's 117649. Divided by 7, it's 16807, so 7^6 ≡0 mod7. So that's 0. So that's correct.

Another example: 2^6=64≡1 mod7. 3^6=729. Let me divide 729 by 7. 7*104=728, so 729≡1 mod7. Correct. Similarly, 4^6=4096. 4096 divided by 7: 7*585=4095, so 4096≡1 mod7. Correct. So all of them are 1 or 0. Therefore, this seems to hold.

Therefore, the conclusion is that any number that is both a square and a cube (i.e., sixth power) is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 7. Therefore, the statement is verified.

But let me check if there's a case where a sixth power could be something else. Suppose a is 7k + 1. Then, (7k + 1)^6 mod7. By binomial theorem, all terms except the last one will have a factor of 7, so they are 0 mod7, and the last term is 1^6=1. Therefore, (7k +1)^6 ≡1 mod7. Similarly, if a is 7k + 2, then (7k + 2)^6 mod7 is 2^6 mod7=64 mod7=1. Similarly for others. So yes, all residues mod7 when raised to the 6th power give 1, except when the number is divisible by 7, which gives 0.

Therefore, this seems solid. Therefore, the answer is that such numbers are either 7k or 7k +1.

Therefore, the verification is done.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0} and \boxed{1}

Wait, but the question says "must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1". So the answer should be that it is congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, so the possible residues are 0 and 1. But the problem says "must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1". So the answer is that it's either 0 mod7 or 1 mod7, which corresponds to 7k or 7k +1. Therefore, the final answer is that it must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 7, so the possible forms are 7k or 7k +1. Therefore, the answer is that the number is either 7k or 7k +1. But the problem says "verify that if an integer is simultaneously a square and a cube..., then it must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1". Therefore, the answer is that such numbers are congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, so they are of the form 7k or 7k +1. Therefore, the answer is that the number is either 7k or 7k +1. However, the problem says "verify that... must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1". So the answer is that they are congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, so the forms are 7k or 7k +1. Therefore, the answer is that it must be either 7k or 7k +1. But in the problem statement, the example is 64=8²=4³, which is 7*9 +1=63 +1=64. So that is 7k +1. So the answer is that such numbers are congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, hence of the form 7k or 7k +1. Therefore, the answer is that they are either 7k or 7k +1. Therefore, the answer is that the integer must be congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, which is equivalent to being of the form 7k or 7k +1. Therefore, the final answer is that the integer is either 7k or 7k +1, so the answer is \boxed{0} and \boxed{1} as residues, but the problem says "must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1". However, the original question says "verify that... then it must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1". Therefore, the answer is that such numbers are congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, so they are of the form 7k or 7k +1. However, the problem might be expecting the answer to be written as "either 7k or 7k + 1", but since the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", and the original question is to verify that such numbers are of the form 7k or 7k +1, but the answer is that they are congruent to 0 or 1 mod7. However, in the problem statement, they give 64 as an example, which is 7*9 +1. So the answer is that the number is congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, hence the forms are 7k or 7k +1. Therefore, the answer is that the integer must be congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, so the answer is \boxed{0} and \boxed{1} as possible residues. However, the problem says "must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1", so maybe the answer is that it is either 7k or 7k +1. However, the user might expect the answer to be written as the possible residues, so 0 and 1 mod7, but in the problem statement, the user says "must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1", so the answer is that it's of the form 7k or 7k +1, which is equivalent to saying that it is congruent to 0 or 1 mod7. Therefore, the answer is that the integer is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 7, so the possible forms are 7k or 7k +1. However, the problem asks to "verify that...", so the answer is that such numbers are congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, so the answer is 0 and 1. But since the problem says "must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1", maybe the answer is that they are of those forms, so the answer is that they are either 7k or 7k +1. However, the user might expect the answer to be boxed as 0 and 1. But in the original problem statement, the example is 64 which is 7k +1, so maybe the answer is that it is congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, so the answer is 0 and 1. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{0} and \boxed{1}. However, the problem says "must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1", so maybe the answer is that the number is congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, so the answer is 0 and 1. However, the instructions say to put the final answer within \boxed{}, but there are two answers. But maybe the problem is expecting to write that the number is congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, so the possible residues are 0 and 1. Therefore, the answer is that it must be congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, so the answer is \boxed{0} and \boxed{1}. But maybe the problem is expecting a single answer? Wait, the original problem says "must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1". So the answer is that it is of the form 7k or 7k +1. Therefore, the answer is that the integer is either 7k or 7k +1. However, the user might want the answer in terms of congruence classes, which are 0 and 1 mod7. But the original question says "must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1", so the answer is that it is either 7k or 7k +1. Therefore, the answer is that the integer is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 7, so the answer is \boxed{0} and \boxed{1}. But the problem might expect the answer to be written as "either 7k or 7k +1", but since the user wants the answer in boxed, maybe they expect the possible residues. However, in the problem statement, they give an example of 64 which is 7k +1, so the answer is that it is either 0 or 1 mod7, so the answer is \boxed{0} and \boxed{1}. However, in some contexts, when you have to write the possible residues, you might write both. But since the user might have intended to have the answer as the two residues, I think that is the case. Therefore, I think the answer is \boxed{0} and \boxed{1}.

But looking back at the problem statement: "Verify that if an integer is simultaneously a square and a cube (as is the case with 64 = 8² = 4³), then it must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1." So the problem is asking to verify that such numbers are of the form 7k or 7k +1. Therefore, the answer is that they are congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, which is equivalent to being of the form 7k or 7k +1. Therefore, the answer is that they must be congruent to 0 or 1 mod7. However, the problem says "must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1", so the answer is that they are of those forms. But since the user wants the answer in boxed, maybe the answer is that the possible residues are 0 and 1, so boxed 0 and 1. But in the original problem, they have an example of 64 which is 7k +1, and 0 is also possible (for example, 0 is 0^6, which is 0 mod7). Therefore, the answer is that the number is congruent to 0 or 1 mod7. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{0} and \boxed{1}.

But maybe the problem expects the answer to be written as "either 7k or 7k + 1", but since the user wants the answer in boxed, and there are two possibilities, maybe the answer is \boxed{0} and \boxed{1}.

But looking at the problem statement again: "Verify that if an integer is simultaneously a square and a cube..., then it must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1." Therefore, the answer is that such integers are of the form 7k or 7k +1. Therefore, the answer is that they are congruent to 0 or 1 mod7, which is equivalent to being of those forms. Therefore, the answer is that they are congruent to 0 or 1 mod7. However, the problem says "must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1", so the answer is that they are of those forms. Since the user wants the final answer in boxed, and there are two forms, but maybe the answer is that the possible residues are 0 and 1. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{0} and \boxed{1}.

But maybe the problem expects the answer to be written as "either 7k or 7k +1", but since the user wants the answer in boxed, maybe they need to write both residues. However, in some contexts, when you have to state the congruence classes, you can write both. Therefore, I think the answer is that the number is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 7, so the answer is \boxed{0} and \boxed{1}.

**Final Answer**
The integer must be congruent to either \boxed{0} or \boxed{1} modulo 7.

To verify that any integer that is both a square and a cube must be of the form $ 7k $ or $ 7k + 1 $, we begin by recognizing that such a number is a **sixth power**. This is because:

- A square is of the form $ a^2 $,
- A cube is of the form $ a^3 $,
- Therefore, a number that is both a square and a cube must be a sixth power: $ a^6 $, since $ \text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6 $.

### Step 1: Understanding the Sixth Powers Modulo 7

We now analyze the behavior of $ a^6 \mod 7 $ for any integer $ a $.

#### Case 1: $ a \equiv 0 \mod 7 $

If $ a $ is divisible by 7, then $ a = 7k $, and $ a^6 = (7k)^6 = 7^6 \cdot k^6 \equiv 0 \mod 7 $.

#### Case 2: $ a \not\equiv 0 \mod 7 $

In this case, $ a $ is coprime to 7. By **Fermat's Little Theorem**, for any integer $ a $ not divisible by a prime $ p $, we have:

$$
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p
$$

Since 7 is prime, and $ a \not\equiv 0 \mod 7 $, we have:

$$
a^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7
$$

---

### Step 2: Conclusion

Combining both cases:

- If $ a \equiv 0 \mod 7 $, then $ a^6 \equiv 0 \mod 7 $,
- If $ a \not\equiv 0 \mod 7 $, then $ a^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7 $.

Therefore, **any sixth power is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 7**.

This implies that any number that is both a square and a cube (i.e., a sixth power) must be of the form:

- $ 7k $ (if $ a^6 \equiv 0 \mod 7 $), or
- $ 7k + 1 $ (if $ a^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7 $).

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{0} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{1}
$$
