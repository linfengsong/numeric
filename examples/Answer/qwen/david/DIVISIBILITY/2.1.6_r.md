Okay, so I need to solve part (a) and then use it for part (b). Let me start with part (a). The problem says that if a triangular number tn is a perfect square, then t_{4n(n+1)} is also a square. Hmm, triangular numbers... I remember that the nth triangular number is given by the formula tn = n(n+1)/2. So, if tn is a perfect square, then n(n+1)/2 is a square. And I need to show that t_{4n(n+1)} is also a square. Let me write that down.

First, let me recall the formula for the triangular number. The nth triangular number is tn = n(n+1)/2. So if tn is a square, then n(n+1)/2 = k² for some integer k. Now, the problem says to prove that t_{4n(n+1)} is also a square. Let me compute t_{4n(n+1)} using the formula. That would be:

t_{4n(n+1)} = [4n(n+1) * (4n(n+1) + 1)] / 2.

Simplify that expression. Let me compute the numerator first:

4n(n+1) * [4n(n+1) + 1] = 4n(n+1) * [4n(n+1) + 1].

So then, dividing by 2, we get:

[4n(n+1) * (4n(n+1) + 1)] / 2 = 2n(n+1) * [4n(n+1) + 1].

So, t_{4n(n+1)} = 2n(n+1) * [4n(n+1) + 1]. Now, since tn = n(n+1)/2 is a square, let me denote that as k². Therefore, n(n+1) = 2k². Let me substitute that into the expression for t_{4n(n+1)}.

So replacing n(n+1) with 2k²:

t_{4n(n+1)} = 2*(2k²) * [4*(2k²) + 1] = 4k² * [8k² + 1].

So, t_{4n(n+1)} = 4k²*(8k² + 1). Now, I need to show that this is a perfect square. Let me see. If I can write this as something squared, then it's a square. Let me think.

Let me denote 4k²*(8k² + 1). Let me factor out the 4: 4k²*(8k² + 1) = [2k]^2 * (8k² + 1). So, if I can show that 8k² + 1 is a square, then the entire expression would be a square. But wait, is 8k² + 1 a square? Hmm, not necessarily. Wait, maybe there's another way to look at this.

Alternatively, maybe I need to relate this to the original triangular number. Let me think again. Since tn = k², and tn = n(n+1)/2, so n(n+1) = 2k². Let me think about the expression 4n(n+1) + 1. Wait, that's 4*(n(n+1)) + 1 = 4*(2k²) + 1 = 8k² + 1. So, that's the same as before. So, t_{4n(n+1)} = 2n(n+1)*(4n(n+1) + 1) = 2*(2k²)*(8k² + 1) = 4k²*(8k² + 1). So, as before.

So, if I can show that 4k²*(8k² + 1) is a square, then that's the conclusion. Let me think about this. Suppose 8k² + 1 is a square. Then, 4k²*(square) would be a square. But how do I know that 8k² + 1 is a square? Wait, maybe not. Maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a relationship between tn and t_{4n(n+1)}. Maybe there's a formula or identity that connects them. Alternatively, maybe I can think of t_{4n(n+1)} as another triangular number, and relate it to the original square.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the fact that if tn is a square, then there's a specific relationship between n and k. Let me recall that triangular numbers which are also squares are called square triangular numbers. There is a known formula for generating them, but maybe I need to derive it here.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that if tn is a square, then there exists integers m and n such that m(m+1)/2 = k², and then t_{4n(n+1)} is also a square. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I need to find an expression for t_{4n(n+1)} in terms of k. Let me think again. Let me take the expression 4k²*(8k² + 1). Let me denote this as something squared. Suppose that 4k²*(8k² + 1) = (something)^2. Let me try to write it as (a*k + b)^2 or something similar. Let me try:

Let me think of 4k²*(8k² + 1) as (2k * sqrt(8k² + 1))², but that's not helpful unless sqrt(8k² + 1) is rational. But since k is integer, sqrt(8k² + 1) is irrational unless 8k² + 1 is a perfect square. But how do I know that?

Wait, but the problem says that tn is a square, so n(n+1)/2 = k². Therefore, n and n+1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, since their product is 2k², each of them must be a square times a factor of 2. Since they are coprime, one of them must be twice a square and the other must be a square. So, either n = 2a² and n+1 = b², or n = a² and n+1 = 2b². Therefore, there are two cases.

So, maybe this is the key. Let me consider that. If n(n+1) = 2k², then since n and n+1 are coprime, one of them is twice a square and the other is a square. Therefore, either:

Case 1: n = 2a² and n + 1 = b², so that 2a² + 1 = b².

Case 2: n = a² and n + 1 = 2b², so that a² + 1 = 2b².

Therefore, in either case, we have a Pell equation. For example, in case 1: b² - 2a² = 1, which is Pell's equation. Similarly, in case 2: a² - 2b² = -1, which is also a Pell equation.

But perhaps this is getting too deep into Pell equations. However, maybe this can help us in computing t_{4n(n+1)}.

Let me try with case 1 first. Suppose that n = 2a² and n + 1 = b². Then, n(n+1) = 2a² * b² = 2k², so k = a*b. Therefore, in this case, t_{4n(n+1)} = 4k²*(8k² + 1). Let me compute 8k² + 1. Since k = a*b, then 8k² + 1 = 8a²b² + 1. But from case 1, we have b² = 2a² + 1. Therefore, substituting:

8a²b² + 1 = 8a²*(2a² + 1) + 1 = 16a^4 + 8a² + 1. Hmm, is this a square? Let me check. Let me see if 16a^4 + 8a² + 1 is a square. Let me think of it as (4a² + c)^2. Let me compute (4a² + c)^2 = 16a^4 + 8a²c + c². Comparing to 16a^4 + 8a² + 1, we have 8a²c + c² = 8a² + 1. Let me try c = 1: 8a²*1 + 1 = 8a² + 1. Perfect! So c = 1. Therefore, 16a^4 + 8a² + 1 = (4a² + 1)^2. Therefore, 8k² + 1 = (4a² + 1)^2. Therefore, t_{4n(n+1)} = 4k²*(8k² + 1) = 4k²*(4a² + 1)^2. Since k = a*b, then 4k² = 4a²b². Therefore, t_{4n(n+1)} = 4a²b²*(4a² + 1)^2 = [2ab(4a² + 1)]². Therefore, it is a perfect square. So that works for case 1.

Similarly, let me check case 2. Suppose that n = a² and n + 1 = 2b². Then, n(n+1) = a²*(2b²) = 2a²b² = 2k², so k = a*b. Then, 8k² + 1 = 8a²b² + 1. But since n + 1 = 2b², and n = a², then a² + 1 = 2b². Therefore, similar to case 1, we can substitute. Let me compute 8k² + 1 = 8a²b² + 1. Let me see if this is a square. Again, let me try to express it as something squared. Let me think of 8a²b² + 1. Since a² + 1 = 2b², maybe I can find an expression in terms of that. Let me note that 8a²b² + 1 = 4*(2a²b²) + 1. But 2a²b² is equal to (a²)*(2b²) = a²*(a² + 1). Wait, since n + 1 = 2b², and n = a², so 2b² = a² + 1. Therefore, 2a²b² = a²*(a² + 1). Therefore, 8a²b² + 1 = 4*(a²*(a² + 1)) + 1. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of b.

Alternatively, let me try to write 8a²b² + 1 as (something)^2. Let me think again. Let me use the relation a² + 1 = 2b². Therefore, b² = (a² + 1)/2. Substitute into 8a²b² + 1:

8a²*( (a² + 1)/2 ) + 1 = 4a²(a² + 1) + 1 = 4a^4 + 4a² + 1. Is this a square? Let me check. Let me think of (2a² + c)^2. Let me compute (2a² + 1)^2 = 4a^4 + 4a² + 1. Yes! Exactly. Therefore, 4a^4 + 4a² + 1 = (2a² + 1)^2. Therefore, 8k² + 1 = (2a² + 1)^2. Therefore, t_{4n(n+1)} = 4k²*(8k² + 1) = 4k²*(2a² + 1)^2. Again, since k = ab, 4k² = 4a²b², so t_{4n(n+1)} = 4a²b²*(2a² + 1)^2 = [2ab(2a² + 1)]². Therefore, it is a square. Therefore, in both cases, t_{4n(n+1)} is a square. Therefore, the statement is proven.

Therefore, part (a) is done. Now, moving on to part (b). Use part (a) to find three examples of squares that are also triangular numbers.

So, first, I need to recall that square triangular numbers are numbers that are both triangular and square. The problem says to use part (a) to find three examples. So, perhaps we need to use the result from part (a) to generate examples.

From part (a), if tn is a square, then t_{4n(n+1)} is also a square. Therefore, if we can find some n for which tn is a square, then t_{4n(n+1)} will also be a square. Therefore, to find examples, we need to find such n where tn is a square, then compute t_{4n(n+1)}.

But how do we find such n? Well, the square triangular numbers are known. The first few are 0, 1, 36, 1225, 41616, etc. But maybe we can generate them using the formula from part (a). Alternatively, since part (a) gives a way to generate another square triangular number from an existing one.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that if tn is a square, then t_{4n(n+1)} is a square. Therefore, if we can find a square triangular number, then we can generate another one. Let me think.

First, the trivial square triangular number is 0, which is t_0 = 0. Then, t_1 = 1, which is also a square. So, if we take n=1, then t_1 is a square. Then, according to part (a), t_{4*1*(1+1)} = t_{8} is also a square. Let me compute t_8. t_8 = 8*9/2 = 36. Which is 6². So that's a square. Therefore, 36 is a square triangular number. So that's one example.

Similarly, if we take n=1, which gives t_1=1, then t_8=36. Then, if we take n=8, since t_8=36 is a square, then t_{4*8*(8+1)} = t_{4*8*9} = t_{288} is also a square. Let me compute t_{288}. t_{288} = 288*289/2 = 144*289 = 144*289. 144 is 12², 289 is 17². Therefore, t_{288} = (12*17)^2 = 204². Therefore, 204² is a square triangular number. Therefore, that's another example.

Similarly, if we take n=288, then t_{288} is a square, so t_{4*288*(288+1)} = t_{4*288*289} would be a square. But that would be a larger number, so maybe that's the third example. However, the problem says to find three examples. But maybe there are smaller ones. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe there are other square triangular numbers that can be generated from different n. For example, the next square triangular number after 36 is 1225. Let me check if that can be generated through part (a). Let me see, if we take n= something such that tn is 1225. Wait, but maybe we can use the previous examples.

Alternatively, since we have t_1 = 1, then t_8 = 36. Then t_{4*8*9} = t_{288} = 204². Then t_{4*288*289} would be t_{4*288*289} which is a square. But that's a huge number. However, maybe there's another way. Alternatively, maybe there are other square triangular numbers that can be generated by different n.

Alternatively, maybe the first few square triangular numbers are 0, 1, 36, 1225, 41616, etc. So, if we can generate them using part (a), then maybe 1, 36, 1225 are the examples. Let me check if 1225 is generated by part (a). Let me see, suppose that tn is 1225. Let me find n such that tn = 1225. So n(n+1)/2 = 1225. Therefore, n² + n - 2450 = 0. Solving quadratic equation: n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 9800)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(9801)] / 2. sqrt(9801) is 99, so n = (-1 + 99)/2 = 98/2 = 49. Therefore, t_49 = 49*50/2 = 1225. So, if n=49, then tn = 1225 is a square. Therefore, according to part (a), t_{4*49*(49+1)} = t_{4*49*50} = t_{9800} is a square. Let me compute t_{9800}. t_{9800} = 9800*9801/2 = 4900*9801. Now, 4900 is 70², and 9801 is 99². Therefore, t_{9800} = (70*99)^2 = 6930². Therefore, that's another square triangular number. So, 1225 is the second one, and 6930² is the next one.

But the problem says to find three examples. So, maybe the three examples are 0, 1, 36, 1225, etc. But 0 is trivial. The problem says "three examples of squares that are also triangular numbers". So, maybe 1, 36, 1225. Alternatively, 1, 36, 41616. But maybe the first three non-zero ones are 1, 36, 1225. Let me check if 1225 is indeed a triangular number. Yes, as we saw, t_49 = 1225. And 1225 is 35². So, yes, that's a square triangular number.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the three examples generated through part (a). So, starting with t_1 = 1, then t_8 = 36, then t_{288} = 204², then t_{9800} = 6930². Therefore, three examples would be 1, 36, 204². But 204² is 41616. Wait, let me check that. 204 squared: 200² = 40000, 2*200*4 = 1600, 4² = 16, so (200 + 4)^2 = 40000 + 1600 + 16 = 41616. Yes. So, 41616 is another square triangular number. Therefore, three examples could be 1, 36, 41616. But maybe the problem wants the numbers themselves, not the indices. So, 1, 36, 41616. Alternatively, maybe 1, 36, 1225. But according to the previous calculation, 1225 is generated from n=49, which is a square triangular number. However, if we use part (a), starting from n=1, we get 1, then t_8=36, then t_{288}=41616. So maybe 1, 36, 41616. Alternatively, maybe 1, 36, 1225. But how do we know which ones are generated through part (a)?

Wait, the problem says "use part (a) to find three examples". Therefore, we need to use the result from part (a) to generate examples. So, starting from a known square triangular number, then applying part (a) to get another one. So, if we take the first square triangular number, which is 1 (t_1 = 1), then using part (a), we get t_8 = 36. Then, using part (a) again on t_8 = 36, we get t_{4*8*9} = t_{288} = 41616. Therefore, three examples are 1, 36, 41616. Alternatively, if we take t_0 = 0, but 0 is trivial. However, maybe the problem wants non-zero examples. Therefore, 1, 36, 41616. Alternatively, maybe 1, 36, 1225. But how is 1225 generated?

Alternatively, if we take n=49 (since t_49 = 1225 is a square), then t_{4*49*50} = t_{9800} = 6930². Therefore, 6930² is another example. But that is larger. Therefore, depending on the problem's requirement, maybe 1, 36, 41616 are the three examples. However, 1225 is also a square triangular number. So, maybe the problem expects us to use part (a) to generate them, so starting from 1, then 36, then 41616. Therefore, three examples are 1, 36, 41616.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants three examples that are not generated by part (a) from each other? But no, the problem says "use part (a) to find three examples", so we can use part (a) to generate them. Therefore, starting from the first square triangular number, 1, then applying part (a) to get 36, then applying part (a) again to get 41616. Therefore, those three numbers. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the numbers 1, 36, 1225. Let me check if 1225 is generated via part (a). If we take n= something where tn is 1225. For example, if we take n=49, then t_{4n(n+1)} = t_{4*49*50} = t_{9800} which is 6930². But 1225 is t_49. Therefore, if we take n= something else. Wait, but maybe if we take n= something else where tn is a square. For example, if we take n=0, then tn=0, which is a square. Then t_{4*0*1}=t_0=0, which is also a square. But that's trivial.

Alternatively, maybe there are other square triangular numbers that can be generated. However, according to the problem, part (a) says that if tn is a square, then t_{4n(n+1)} is also a square. Therefore, if we can find three different n where tn is a square, then we can generate three different t_{4n(n+1)} which are squares. However, the first few square triangular numbers are 0, 1, 36, 1225, 41616, etc. Therefore, maybe the three examples are 1, 36, 1225. But how do we know that 1225 is generated via part (a)? Well, 1225 is t_49. If we take n=49, then t_{4*49*50} is t_{9800} which is 6930². Therefore, 1225 is not generated by part (a) from another square triangular number. Instead, 1225 is a square triangular number, but it's not generated by part (a) from another square triangular number. Therefore, maybe the three examples are 1, 36, 41616. Because 1 is generated by n=1, then 36 is generated by part (a) from n=1, then 41616 is generated by part (a) from n=8. Therefore, these three examples are generated via part (a). Therefore, the answer would be 1, 36, 41616.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the numbers 1, 36, 1225, but since 1225 is not generated by part (a) from another square triangular number, but is itself a square triangular number. However, since the problem says "use part (a) to find three examples", it's possible that the examples should be generated via part (a). Therefore, starting from 1, then 36, then 41616.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the three examples to be the numbers 0, 1, 36. But 0 is trivial. However, the problem says "three examples of squares that are also triangular numbers", so 0 is a square and a triangular number, but maybe the problem is looking for positive integers. Therefore, 1, 36, 1225. But how do we know that 1225 is generated by part (a)? Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to use part (a) to generate the numbers. So, starting with t_1 = 1, then t_8 = 36, then t_{4*8*9} = t_{288} = 41616. Therefore, three examples are 1, 36, 41616.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me check the numbers:

- 1 is t_1 = 1, which is 1².

- 36 is t_8 = 36, which is 6².

- 1225 is t_49 = 1225, which is 35².

- 41616 is t_288 = 41616, which is 204².

So, these are the square triangular numbers. The problem says to use part (a) to find three examples. Therefore, since part (a) allows us to generate from a square triangular number another one. So, starting from 1, we get 36, then from 36 we get 41616, then from 41616 we get another one. Therefore, three examples are 1, 36, 41616.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects 1, 36, 1225, but since 1225 is not generated by part (a) from another square triangular number. Wait, but 1225 is t_49. If we take n=49, then t_{4*49*50} = t_{9800} = 6930². Therefore, 1225 is not generated by part (a) from another square triangular number. Therefore, if we use part (a), the examples generated are 1, 36, 41616, etc. Therefore, those are the examples.

Therefore, the three examples are 1, 36, and 41616.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the numbers in the form of t_{...} which are squares. For example, t_1=1, t_8=36, t_{288}=41616. Therefore, the three examples are 1, 36, 41616.

Therefore, I think that is the answer. So, part (a) is proven, and part (b) uses part (a) to generate examples starting from t_1=1, then t_8=36, then t_{288}=41616.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{t_{4n(n+1)}} is a square.

(b) Three examples are \boxed{1}, \boxed{36}, and \boxed{41616}.
</think>

To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the structure of triangular numbers and their relationship to perfect squares.

---

### **(a) Proof that $ t_{4n(n+1)} $ is a square if $ t_n $ is a square**

The $ n $-th triangular number is given by:

$$
t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

Suppose $ t_n $ is a perfect square, i.e.,

$$
t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = k^2 \quad \text{for some integer } k
$$

Then, multiplying both sides by 2:

$$
n(n+1) = 2k^2
$$

Now, we compute the triangular number $ t_{4n(n+1)} $:

$$
t_{4n(n+1)} = \frac{4n(n+1) \cdot (4n(n+1) + 1)}{2} = 2n(n+1) \cdot (4n(n+1) + 1)
$$

Substituting $ n(n+1) = 2k^2 $, we get:

$$
t_{4n(n+1)} = 2(2k^2)(4 \cdot 2k^2 + 1) = 4k^2(8k^2 + 1)
$$

Now, we analyze $ 8k^2 + 1 $. From the assumption that $ t_n = k^2 $, we know that $ n(n+1) = 2k^2 $. Since $ n $ and $ n+1 $ are consecutive integers, they are coprime, so one must be a square and the other twice a square. This leads to the two cases:

- $ n = 2a^2 $, $ n+1 = b^2 $, or
- $ n = a^2 $, $ n+1 = 2b^2 $

In both cases, we can show that $ 8k^2 + 1 $ is a perfect square. This is because:

- If $ n = 2a^2 $, then $ b^2 = 2a^2 + 1 $, so $ 8k^2 + 1 = (4a^2 + 1)^2 $
- If $ n = a^2 $, then $ b^2 = \frac{a^2 + 1}{2} $, so $ 8k^2 + 1 = (2a^2 + 1)^2 $

Therefore, in either case:

$$
t_{4n(n+1)} = 4k^2(8k^2 + 1) = [2k(4a^2 + 1)]^2 \quad \text{or} \quad [2k(2a^2 + 1)]^2
$$

Thus, $ t_{4n(n+1)} $ is a perfect square.

---

### **(b) Using Part (a) to Find Three Examples of Square Triangular Numbers**

From part (a), we can generate new square triangular numbers from existing ones by applying the formula:

$$
t_{4n(n+1)} \text{ is a square if } t_n \text{ is a square}
$$

Let’s find three such examples:

- **First Example: $ t_1 = 1 $**  
  $ t_1 = \frac{1 \cdot 2}{2} = 1 $, which is $ 1^2 $.  
  Then,  
  $$
  t_{4 \cdot 1 \cdot 2} = t_8 = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 = 6^2
  $$

- **Second Example: $ t_8 = 36 $**  
  $ t_8 = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 = 6^2 $  
  Then,  
  $$
  t_{4 \cdot 8 \cdot 9} = t_{288} = \frac{288 \cdot 289}{2} = 144 \cdot 289 = (12 \cdot 17)^2 = 204^2
  $$

- **Third Example: $ t_{288} = 41616 $**  
  $ t_{288} = 41616 = 204^2 $  
  Then,  
  $$
  t_{4 \cdot 288 \cdot 289} = t_{4 \cdot 288 \cdot 289} = \text{another square triangular number}
  $$

But we are only asked for **three examples**, so we can stop at the first three: $ t_1 = 1 $, $ t_8 = 36 $, and $ t_{288} = 41616 $

---

### **Final Answer**

**(a)** $\boxed{t_{4n(n+1)}}$ is a square.

**(b)** Three examples of squares that are also triangular numbers are:

$$
\boxed{1}, \quad \boxed{36}, \quad \boxed{41616}
$$
