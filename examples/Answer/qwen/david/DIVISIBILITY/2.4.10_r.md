Okay, so I need to prove three statements about the least common multiple (lcm) of two nonzero integers a and b. Let me take them one by one. First, let me recall some basic definitions and properties to make sure I have the right foundation.

The least common multiple of two integers a and b, denoted lcm(a, b), is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both a and b. The greatest common divisor, gcd(a, b), is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b. There's a well-known relationship between gcd and lcm: for any two nonzero integers a and b, the product of the gcd and lcm is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. That is, gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = |a * b|. I remember this formula is often useful in these problems.

Starting with part (a): gcd(a, b) = lcm(a, b) if and only if a = ±b.

Hmm. So, if the gcd equals the lcm, then a and b must be equal or negatives of each other. Let me think. Let me first suppose that a = b. Then, gcd(a, a) is a, and lcm(a, a) is also a. So indeed, gcd(a, a) = lcm(a, a). Similarly, if a = -b, then gcd(a, -b) is the same as gcd(a, b), since gcd is always positive. Wait, but if a = -b, then gcd(a, b) is gcd(a, -a) which is |a|. Similarly, lcm(a, -a) is |a|. So, in that case, gcd(a, b) = lcm(a, b) = |a|. Therefore, if a = ±b, then gcd(a, b) equals lcm(a, b). 

Now, the converse: if gcd(a, b) = lcm(a, b), then a = ±b. Let me try to prove this. Let me use the formula that gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = |a * b|. If gcd(a, b) = lcm(a, b), then substituting into the formula, we have [gcd(a, b)]^2 = |a * b|. Therefore, gcd(a, b)^2 = |a * b|. Let me denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, we have d^2 = |a * b|. But since d is the gcd, we can write a = d * m and b = d * n, where m and n are coprime integers (i.e., gcd(m, n) = 1). Then, substituting into the equation, we get d^2 = |d * m * d * n| = d^2 * |m * n|. Therefore, d^2 = d^2 * |m * n|. Dividing both sides by d^2 (since d is nonzero), we get 1 = |m * n|. Therefore, |m * n| = 1. The only integers m and n such that |m * n| = 1 are m = 1, n = 1 or m = -1, n = -1, or m = 1, n = -1, or m = -1, n = 1. However, since m and n are coprime, let's check these possibilities.

If m = 1 and n = 1, then a = d * 1 = d, b = d * 1 = d, so a = b. If m = -1 and n = -1, then a = -d, b = -d, so a = b. If m = 1 and n = -1, then a = d * 1 = d, b = d * (-1) = -d, so a = -b. Similarly, if m = -1 and n = 1, then a = -d, b = d, so again a = -b. Therefore, in all cases, a and b are either equal or negatives of each other. Therefore, the converse holds. Therefore, part (a) is proven.

Moving on to part (b): If k > 0, then lcm(ka, kb) = k * lcm(a, b).

Okay, so scaling both a and b by a positive integer k, the lcm scales by the same k. Let me think. Let me recall that lcm(ka, kb) is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both ka and kb. Since ka and kb are just k times a and k times b, then the lcm of ka and kb should be k times the lcm of a and b. Let me try to verify this.

Alternatively, using the formula that relates gcd and lcm. Let me compute lcm(ka, kb). Using the formula, lcm(ka, kb) = |ka * kb| / gcd(ka, kb). Let me compute that. The numerator is |k^2 ab|. The denominator is gcd(ka, kb). Now, gcd(ka, kb) = k * gcd(a, b), since k is a common factor. Therefore, substituting back, we have |k^2 ab| / [k * gcd(a, b)] = |k^2 ab| / [k * gcd(a, b)] = |k * ab / gcd(a, b)|. But from the original formula, we know that lcm(a, b) = |ab| / gcd(a, b). Therefore, substituting, we have |k * (ab / gcd(a, b))| = k * |ab / gcd(a, b)| = k * lcm(a, b). Since k is positive, the absolute value can be removed. Therefore, lcm(ka, kb) = k * lcm(a, b). Therefore, part (b) is proven.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it more intuitively. If you multiply both numbers by k, then their lcm should also be multiplied by k, because the lcm is the smallest number that both can divide. If you scale both numbers by k, then the lcm scales by k. For example, if a = 2, b = 3, then lcm(2, 3) = 6. If k = 2, then lcm(4, 6) = 12, which is 2 * 6. So that works. If a and b are negative, say a = -2, b = -3, then lcm(-2, -3) is still 6, and lcm(-4, -6) is 12, which is 2 * 6. So that also works. So that seems to check out.

Now part (c): If m is any common multiple of a and b, then lcm(a, b) divides m.

So, the least common multiple is the smallest positive common multiple. Therefore, if m is any common multiple, then it must be a multiple of the least one. Therefore, lcm(a, b) divides m. Let me try to formalize this.

Since lcm(a, b) is the least common multiple, by definition, it is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both a and b. Therefore, if m is a common multiple of a and b, then m must be a multiple of lcm(a, b). Therefore, lcm(a, b) divides m. 

Alternatively, using the formula again. Since m is a common multiple of a and b, then m is a multiple of both a and b. Therefore, m is a multiple of lcm(a, b). Therefore, lcm(a, b) divides m. 

Alternatively, if I think in terms of the gcd and lcm formula. Let me suppose that m is a common multiple of a and b. Then, m is a multiple of a and of b. Therefore, m = a * x and m = b * y for some integers x and y. Then, since lcm(a, b) is the least common multiple, it must divide m. 

Alternatively, using the property that the lcm is the smallest such number. So if m is a common multiple, then it's at least as big as the lcm. Therefore, lcm(a, b) divides m. 

Wait, but how do I formally show that? Maybe using the fact that lcm(a, b) is the least common multiple. Let me think. Suppose that m is a common multiple of a and b. Then, since lcm(a, b) is the least common multiple, it must be less than or equal to m. Therefore, lcm(a, b) divides m. 

But actually, the definition is that lcm(a, b) is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both a and b. Therefore, if m is a common multiple, then m is greater than or equal to lcm(a, b). But how does that imply that lcm(a, b) divides m? Well, if m is a multiple of both a and b, then m must be a multiple of lcm(a, b). Because lcm(a, b) is the least common multiple. So if m is a multiple of both a and b, then m is a multiple of their lcm. 

Alternatively, think of it as follows: Let me suppose that m is a common multiple of a and b. Then, m is a multiple of a and of b. Therefore, m is a multiple of the least common multiple. Therefore, lcm(a, b) divides m. 

Alternatively, using the formula. Since m is a common multiple, then m is a multiple of both a and b. Therefore, m = lcm(a, b) * k for some integer k ≥ 1. Therefore, lcm(a, b) divides m. 

But maybe I need to be more precise. Let me recall that in number theory, the lcm is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both a and b. Therefore, if m is any common multiple, then m must be a multiple of the lcm. Therefore, lcm(a, b) divides m. 

Alternatively, using the formula that relates gcd and lcm. Let me suppose that m is a common multiple of a and b. Then, since m is a multiple of a and b, then m is a multiple of lcm(a, b). Therefore, lcm(a, b) divides m. 

Alternatively, think about the divisors. Since lcm(a, b) is the least common multiple, then any common multiple must be a multiple of lcm(a, b). Therefore, the statement holds. 

Therefore, part (c) is proven.

Wait, but maybe I should check with an example. Let me take a = 2, b = 3. Then lcm(2, 3) = 6. Any common multiple is 6, 12, 18, etc. So 6 divides 6, 12, 18, etc. So yes, 6 divides them. If I take a = 4, b = 6. Then lcm(4, 6) is 12. Any common multiple is 12, 24, 36, etc. 12 divides all of them. So that works. If a and b are negative, say a = -4, b = -6, then lcm(-4, -6) is 12, and any common multiple is 12, 24, etc. So 12 divides them. So that works. So this seems to hold.

Therefore, all three parts are proven. Let me just check if I made any mistakes in my reasoning.

For part (a), I used the formula gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = |a b|. Then, if gcd(a, b) = lcm(a, b), then that product is [gcd]^2 = |a b|. Then, by expressing a and b as d*m and d*n, with m and n coprime, we get that |m n| = 1, which leads to m and n being ±1, so a and b are multiples of d by ±1, hence a = ±b. That seems correct.

For part (b), using the formula for lcm(ka, kb) as |k^2 ab| / gcd(ka, kb). Then, since gcd(ka, kb) = k * gcd(a, b), so the ratio is |k^2 ab| / [k * gcd(a, b)] = k * |ab / gcd(a, b)| = k * lcm(a, b). Since k is positive, absolute value is not necessary. So that's correct.

For part (c), using the definition that lcm is the least common multiple, so any common multiple must be a multiple of it. Therefore, lcm divides m. That seems straightforward.

Therefore, I think all three parts are proven correctly. So the answer is that all three statements are established as required.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{a = \pm b}  
(b) \boxed{k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)}  
(c) \boxed{\text{lcm}(a, b) \mid m}

To establish the three facts about the least common multiple (lcm) of two nonzero integers $ a $ and $ b $, we proceed as follows:

---

### (a) **$ \gcd(a, b) = \text{lcm}(a, b) $ if and only if $ a = \pm b $**

We begin by using the fundamental identity:

$$
\gcd(a, b) \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) = |a b|
$$

If $ \gcd(a, b) = \text{lcm}(a, b) $, then:

$$
\gcd(a, b)^2 = |a b|
$$

Let $ d = \gcd(a, b) $, and write $ a = d m $, $ b = d n $, where $ \gcd(m, n) = 1 $. Then:

$$
d^2 = |d m \cdot d n| = d^2 |m n| \Rightarrow |m n| = 1
$$

The only integer solutions to $ |m n| = 1 $ are $ (m, n) = (\pm 1, \pm 1) $. Therefore, $ a = \pm d $, $ b = \pm d $, so $ a = \pm b $.

Conversely, if $ a = \pm b $, then $ \gcd(a, b) = |a| = \text{lcm}(a, b) $, since both $ a $ and $ b $ are equal in magnitude.

**Conclusion:** $ \gcd(a, b) = \text{lcm}(a, b) $ if and only if $ a = \pm b $.

$$
\boxed{a = \pm b}
$$

### (b) **If $ k > 0 $, then $ \text{lcm}(ka, kb) = k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) $**

Using the identity:

$$
\text{lcm}(ka, kb) = \frac{|ka \cdot kb|}{\gcd(ka, kb)} = \frac{k^2 |ab|}{k \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = \frac{k |ab|}{\gcd(a, b)} = k \cdot \frac{|ab|}{\gcd(a, b)} = k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)
$$

Thus, the lcm of $ ka $ and $ kb $ is indeed $ k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) $.

$$
\boxed{k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)}
$$

---

### (c) **If $ m $ is any common multiple of $ a $ and $ b $, then $ \text{lcm}(a, b) \mid m $**

By definition, the least common multiple $ \text{lcm}(a, b) $ is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $ a $ and $ b $. Therefore, any common multiple $ m $ of $ a $ and $ b $ must be a multiple of $ \text{lcm}(a, b) $, which implies that:

$$
\text{lcm}(a, b) \mid m
$$

This follows directly from the definition of lcm as the least such number.

$$
\boxed{\text{lcm}(a, b) \mid m}
$$

---

### Final Answers

(a) $\boxed{a = \pm b}$  
(b) $\boxed{k \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)}$  
(c) $\boxed{\text{lcm}(a, b) \mid m}$
