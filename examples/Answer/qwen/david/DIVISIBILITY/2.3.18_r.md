Okay, so I need to prove that the product of any three consecutive integers is divisible by 6, any four consecutive integers is divisible by 24, and any five consecutive integers is divisible by 120. Let me start with the first one: three consecutive integers.

First, let me recall that 6 is 2 × 3. So, if I can show that among three consecutive numbers, there is at least one even number (so divisible by 2) and at least one multiple of 3, then their product will be divisible by 6. That seems straightforward. Let me think of three consecutive integers: let's say n, n+1, n+2. 

In any three consecutive integers, there must be at least one even number because every other number is even. For example, if n is even, then n is divisible by 2. If n is odd, then n+1 is even. So, regardless of whether n is even or odd, one of the three numbers is even, so the product will have a factor of 2. 

Now, for the factor of 3. In three consecutive numbers, one of them must be a multiple of 3. Let me check. If I take numbers n, n+1, n+2. If n is divisible by 3, then done. If not, then either n+1 or n+2 must be divisible by 3. Because if n mod 3 is 1, then n+2 is 0 mod 3. If n mod 3 is 2, then n+1 is 0 mod 3. So yes, one of them is divisible by 3. Therefore, the product will have factors of 2 and 3, hence divisible by 6. 

So that's the first part. Now moving on to the second one: product of any four consecutive integers is divisible by 24. 24 is 8 × 3, but actually 24 is 2^3 × 3. So I need to show that in four consecutive numbers, there are enough factors of 2 and 3. 

Alternatively, since 24 is 4! (4 factorial), maybe there's a generalization here. Wait, the product of k consecutive integers is divisible by k! So for k=3, 3! is 6, which matches the first statement. For k=4, 4! is 24, which is the second statement. For k=5, 5! is 120, which is the third statement. So maybe there's a general theorem here. But maybe I need to prove it for each case.

But since the problem is asking for proofs for each of these specific cases, I need to do them individually. Let me try to think for four consecutive integers. Let me denote them as n, n+1, n+2, n+3.

First, for divisibility by 3. In four consecutive numbers, there must be at least one multiple of 3. Because every three consecutive numbers have one multiple of 3, so in four numbers, there must be at least one. Similarly, for divisibility by 2^3=8. Let me check how many factors of 2 are present in four consecutive numbers.

In four consecutive numbers, there are two even numbers. For example, if n is even, then n and n+2 are even. If n is odd, then n+1 and n+3 are even. So there are two even numbers. However, depending on whether those even numbers are multiples of 4 or not, the total number of factors of 2 may vary. For example, if one of them is divisible by 4, then that contributes two factors of 2, and the other even number contributes one factor of 2. So total of three factors of 2. If both even numbers are congruent to 2 mod 4, then each contributes one factor of 2, so total two factors of 2. But wait, but in four consecutive numbers, can both even numbers be 2 mod 4?

Let me check. Suppose n is even. Then n is 0 mod 2. If n is 0 mod 4, then n is divisible by 4. If n is 2 mod 4, then n is 2 mod 4, and n+2 is 0 mod 4. So in that case, n+2 is divisible by 4, contributing two factors of 2. If n is 2 mod 4, then n+1 is odd, n+2 is 0 mod 4, n+3 is 1 mod 4. So in that case, the two even numbers are n and n+2. Wait, n is 2 mod 4, so n is 2, and n+2 is 4, which is 0 mod 4. So n is 2 mod 4, contributing one factor of 2, and n+2 is 0 mod 4, contributing two factors of 2. So total of three factors of 2. 

Alternatively, if n is 0 mod 4, then n is divisible by 4 (two factors of 2), and n+2 is 2 mod 4 (one factor of 2). So again, total of three factors of 2. If n is 1 mod 4, then n+1 is 2 mod 4, n+3 is 0 mod 4. So n+1 is 2 mod 4, contributing one factor of 2, and n+3 is 0 mod 4, contributing two factors of 2. Again total of three factors of 2. Similarly, if n is 3 mod 4, then n+1 is 0 mod 4, n+3 is 2 mod 4. So same as above. 

So in all cases, there are three factors of 2 in the product. Therefore, the product is divisible by 2^3 * 3 = 8 * 3 = 24. Therefore, the product of four consecutive integers is divisible by 24. 

Wait, but let me check with an example. Let's take numbers 1,2,3,4. Product is 24, which is 24. Divisible by 24. Another example: 2,3,4,5. Product is 120, which is 24*5. Divisible by 24. Another example: 3,4,5,6. Product is 360. 360 divided by 24 is 15. Yes. Another example: 4,5,6,7. Product is 840. 840 divided by 24 is 35. Yes. What about numbers where there's a multiple of 8? For example, 5,6,7,8. Product is 5*6*7*8 = 1680. 1680 divided by 24 is 70. Yes. So seems okay. 

Alternatively, if I take numbers where maybe there's only two factors of 2? Wait, but according to the above reasoning, there must be three factors of 2. Let me check. Suppose n is 1. Then numbers 1,2,3,4. 2 is 2, 4 is 4. So 2^1 * 2^2 = 2^3. So that's three factors. If n is 2, numbers 2,3,4,5. 2 is 2, 4 is 4. Again 2^1 * 2^2. If n is 3, numbers 3,4,5,6. 4 is 4, 6 is 2. So 2^2 * 2^1. If n is 4, numbers 4,5,6,7. 4 is 4, 6 is 2. Same thing. So yes, in all cases, there are three factors of 2. So that's why the product is divisible by 8. And since there is at least one multiple of 3, so 8*3=24. 

Therefore, the second part is proven. Now moving on to the third part: product of any five consecutive integers is divisible by 120. 120 is 5! = 120. So again, similar idea. But let me check.

Alternatively, since 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. So need to show that in five consecutive integers, there are at least three factors of 2, at least one factor of 3, and at least one factor of 5. 

First, for the factor of 5: in five consecutive integers, there must be a multiple of 5. Because every five consecutive numbers include a multiple of 5. Similarly, for the factor of 3: in five consecutive numbers, there are at least two multiples of 3? Wait, no. Wait, in five consecutive numbers, how many multiples of 3 can there be? Well, since 3 is smaller than 5, there can be one or two multiples of 3. For example, numbers 1-5: 3 is a multiple of 3. Numbers 2-6: 3 and 6 are multiples of 3. So in five consecutive numbers, there is at least one multiple of 3, but sometimes two. Similarly, for 2: need at least three factors of 2. Let me check.

But maybe it's better to think in terms of the general formula. The product of k consecutive integers is divisible by k! So for k=5, 5! is 120. Therefore, the product is divisible by 120. But maybe I need to prove it directly. 

Alternatively, let me think step by step. Let me take five consecutive integers: n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4. 

First, there must be a multiple of 5. So that gives a factor of 5. Then, for factors of 3: in five consecutive numbers, there are at least two multiples of 3? Wait, no. Let me think. For example, numbers 1-5: only 3 is a multiple of 3. Numbers 2-6: 3 and 6. So sometimes one, sometimes two. But since 5 consecutive numbers, there is at least one multiple of 3. However, to have divisibility by 3, we need at least one factor of 3. But since 5! includes 3, so maybe that's sufficient. However, for divisibility by 2^3, need three factors of 2. Let me check.

In five consecutive numbers, how many factors of 2 are there? Let me think. Let me consider different cases. For example, if the five numbers include a multiple of 4 and a multiple of 2, or multiple of 8, etc. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the same approach as with four numbers. For the factors of 2: in five consecutive numbers, there are at least three factors of 2. Let me check. 

In five consecutive numbers, there are two even numbers. Wait, no. Wait, in five consecutive numbers, there are either two or three even numbers. For example, if n is even, then n, n+2, n+4 are even. So three even numbers. If n is odd, then n+1, n+3, n+5 are even. Wait, but n+5 is outside the five numbers. Wait, the five numbers are n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4. So if n is odd, then n+1 is even, n+3 is even, and n+5 would be even, but n+5 is not in the five numbers. So in that case, only two even numbers: n+1 and n+3. Wait, but n+4 is even if n is even? Wait, if n is even, then n is even, n+2 is even, n+4 is even. So three even numbers. If n is odd, then n+1 is even, n+3 is even, n+5 is even, but n+5 is not in the five numbers. So only two even numbers. Therefore, in five consecutive numbers, there are either two or three even numbers. 

So, in the case of three even numbers, we have three even numbers. Each of them is divisible by 2. However, some of them might be divisible by higher powers of 2. For example, if one of them is divisible by 4, then that contributes two factors of 2. If another is divisible by 4, then that's two more. 

But let's think about the minimum number of factors of 2. Let's take the case where there are three even numbers. Let me suppose that among these three even numbers, there is at least one multiple of 4. Because in three consecutive even numbers, there must be at least one multiple of 4. For example, take three consecutive even numbers: 2,4,6. 4 is divisible by 4. 4,6,8: 4 and 8 are multiples of 4. 6,8,10: 8 is a multiple of 4. So yes, in three consecutive even numbers, there is at least one multiple of 4. Therefore, in that case, the three even numbers contribute at least 2 (from the multiple of 4) plus 1 (from another even number, which is 2 mod 4) so total of 3 factors of 2. 

Alternatively, if there are two even numbers. For example, if the five consecutive numbers are odd, even, odd, even, odd. So two even numbers. Let me check if these two even numbers can contribute enough factors of 2. For example, take numbers 1,2,3,4,5. The even numbers are 2 and 4. 2 is 2, 4 is 4. So factors of 2: 2^1 * 2^2 = 2^3. So that's three factors of 2. Another example: numbers 3,4,5,6,7. Even numbers are 4 and 6. 4 is 2^2, 6 is 2*3. So factors of 2: 2^2 * 2^1 = 2^3. Another example: numbers 5,6,7,8,9. Even numbers are 6 and 8. 6 is 2*3, 8 is 2^3. So factors of 2: 2^1 * 2^3 = 2^4. So that's more than three. 

Another example: numbers 2,3,4,5,6. Even numbers are 2,4,6. Three even numbers. 2 is 2, 4 is 4, 6 is 2. So factors of 2: 2^1 * 2^2 * 2^1 = 2^4. So that's four factors of 2. 

So in all cases, whether there are two or three even numbers, the product has at least three factors of 2. Therefore, the product is divisible by 2^3. 

Therefore, combining with the factors of 3 and 5. Since in five consecutive numbers, there is at least one multiple of 3 and one multiple of 5. Therefore, the product is divisible by 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 8 * 3 * 5 = 120. 

Wait, but let me check if there is a case where there is only one multiple of 3? For example, numbers 1,2,3,4,5. There is 3 as a multiple of 3. Numbers 2,3,4,5,6: 3 and 6. So two multiples of 3. Numbers 4,5,6,7,8: 6 is a multiple of 3. Numbers 5,6,7,8,9: 6 and 9. So two multiples. So in any case, there is at least one multiple of 3. Wait, but actually, in five consecutive numbers, there is at least one multiple of 3. Because 3 divides every third number. So in five numbers, there can be one or two multiples of 3. So even if there is only one multiple of 3, that's sufficient for divisibility by 3. 

Similarly, for 5, there is exactly one multiple of 5 in five consecutive numbers. So that's sufficient. Therefore, the product is divisible by 5, 3, and 8. Hence, 120. 

Therefore, the third part is proven. 

But let me check with an example. Take numbers 1,2,3,4,5: product is 120, which is 120. Divisible by 120. Numbers 2,3,4,5,6: product is 720. 720 / 120 = 6. Yes. Numbers 3,4,5,6,7: 3*4*5*6*7 = 2520. 2520 / 120 = 21. Yes. Numbers 4,5,6,7,8: 4*5*6*7*8 = 6720. 6720 / 120 = 56. Yes. Numbers 5,6,7,8,9: 5*6*7*8*9 = 15120. 15120 / 120 = 126. Yes. So that works. 

Alternatively, take numbers 6,7,8,9,10. Product is 6*7*8*9*10. Let's compute 6*10 = 60, 8*9 = 72, 72*60 = 4320. Then 4320 * 7 = 30240. 30240 / 120 = 252. Yes. 

Therefore, all examples check out. 

Alternatively, another way to think about this is using the concept of factorial. The product of k consecutive integers is divisible by k! because when you take k consecutive integers, you are essentially selecting a permutation of numbers from 1 to k, but with some numbers possibly repeated or skipped. However, the exact reasoning is that in the product, you have all the factors of 1 through k, but since they are consecutive, they include multiples that cover the necessary factors. 

But since the problem asks for proofs, maybe I need to formalize it. 

Alternatively, for the general case, the product of k consecutive integers is divisible by k! because in the product, there are enough multiples of each prime factor in k! to cover the exponents. 

But since the problem is to prove each specific case, I think my previous reasoning suffices. 

So, summarizing:

For three consecutive integers: there is at least one even number (so 2) and at least one multiple of 3, so product divisible by 6.

For four consecutive integers: there are at least three factors of 2 (since in four numbers, there are two even numbers, one of which is divisible by 4, giving 2^3) and at least one multiple of 3, so 2^3 * 3 = 24.

For five consecutive integers: there are at least three factors of 2 (as shown), at least one multiple of 3, and at least one multiple of 5, so 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 120.

Therefore, all three statements are proven.

**Final Answer**
The product of any three consecutive integers is divisible by 6, the product of any four consecutive integers is divisible by 24, and the product of any five consecutive integers is divisible by 120. Thus, the final answers are \boxed{6}, \boxed{24}, and \boxed{120} respectively.

- **Divisibility by 3**: At least one of the five numbers is divisible by 3.
- **Divisibility by 5**: Since the numbers are consecutive, one of them must be divisible by 5.
