Okay, so I need to prove that the nth triangular number t_n is equal to the binomial coefficient "n+1 choose 2". Let me start by recalling what a triangular number is. From what I remember, triangular numbers are numbers that can form an equilateral triangle. The formula for the nth triangular number is usually given as t_n = n(n + 1)/2. But the problem says to express this in terms of binomial coefficients, specifically t_n = C(n+1, 2), where C is the combination function. 

First, let me verify if these two expressions are indeed equivalent. The binomial coefficient C(n+1, 2) is calculated as (n+1)n / 2, right? Because the formula for combinations is C(a, b) = a! / (b!(a - b)!). So if I plug in a = n+1 and b = 2, that would be (n+1)! / (2! (n+1 - 2)!) = (n+1)! / (2! (n - 1)!)). Simplifying that, (n+1)! is (n+1)*n*(n-1)! so dividing by (n-1)! gives (n+1)*n, and then dividing by 2! which is 2. So indeed, C(n+1, 2) = (n+1)n / 2, which is exactly the formula for the triangular number. So that seems to check out. 

But the problem says to "prove" that t_n = C(n+1, 2). So maybe I need to show that the definition of triangular numbers leads to this binomial coefficient expression? Or perhaps there's a combinatorial interpretation?

Let me think. Triangular numbers count the number of objects in a triangle arrangement. For example, the first triangular number is 1, the second is 3, the third is 6, etc. The formula t_n = n(n + 1)/2 is derived from the sum of the first n natural numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. 

But how does this relate to binomial coefficients? Well, binomial coefficients count the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of size n. But here, we have C(n + 1, 2). Maybe there's a combinatorial argument where choosing 2 items from n + 1 items relates to the triangular numbers?

Alternatively, maybe there's an algebraic way to show that the formula for t_n is equivalent to the binomial coefficient. Since we already saw that algebraically they are the same, maybe that's sufficient? But the problem says "prove", so perhaps I need to show that the definition of triangular numbers leads to that binomial coefficient.

Wait, the problem says "in terms of the binomial coefficients", so maybe they want a combinatorial proof? Let me try to think of that.

Triangular numbers can be thought of as the number of ways to choose 2 items from n + 1 items, but why?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate the sum 1 + 2 + ... + n to combinations. Let me recall that the sum from k = 1 to n of k is equal to C(n + 1, 2). Is there a way to see that?

Yes, there is a combinatorial identity that says that the sum of the first n integers is equal to C(n + 1, 2). Let me try to prove that.

Suppose we want to count the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of n + 1 items. Let's say the set is {1, 2, 3, ..., n + 1}. The number of ways to choose 2 items is C(n + 1, 2). Alternatively, we can think of this as the number of pairs (i, j) where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n + 1.

Alternatively, we can think of the number of such pairs as the sum from k = 1 to n of k. Wait, how?

Let me think. For each number k from 1 to n, how many pairs have the first element as k? Well, if we fix the first element as k, then the second element can be any number from k + 1 to n + 1. So that's (n + 1) - k numbers. Therefore, the total number of pairs is the sum from k = 1 to n of (n + 1 - k). 

But let's compute that sum. Let me substitute m = n + 1 - k. When k = 1, m = n. When k = n, m = 1. So the sum becomes sum from m = 1 to n of m, which is the same as the sum from k = 1 to n of k. Therefore, the total number of pairs is equal to the sum of the first n integers, which is t_n. Therefore, C(n + 1, 2) equals t_n. Therefore, we have shown that t_n = C(n + 1, 2). 

So that's a combinatorial proof. Alternatively, if I think of the formula for combinations, C(n + 1, 2) is equal to (n + 1)n / 2, which is the formula for the triangular number. Therefore, both expressions are equivalent.

Alternatively, maybe there's a recursive way to think about it? Let me check.

Triangular numbers have the recursive formula t_n = t_{n-1} + n. But how does that relate to binomial coefficients? Well, C(n + 1, 2) = C(n, 2) + n. Because C(n + 1, 2) = (n + 1)n / 2, and C(n, 2) + n = [n(n - 1)/2] + n = [n(n - 1) + 2n]/2 = [n^2 - n + 2n]/2 = [n^2 + n]/2 = n(n + 1)/2, which is equal to C(n + 1, 2). Therefore, the recursive formula for triangular numbers matches the recursive formula for binomial coefficients. 

But maybe that's not the best way to prove it. The problem says "prove that in terms of the binomial coefficients, t_n = C(n + 1, 2)". So perhaps the question is expecting the algebraic proof, showing that the formula for triangular numbers is equivalent to the binomial coefficient. But since the problem says "prove", maybe they want a more rigorous proof.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the definition of triangular numbers and show that they are equal to the binomial coefficient.

Alternatively, maybe using the definition of binomial coefficients. Let me recall that C(n, k) is the number of ways to choose k elements from n. So C(n + 1, 2) is the number of ways to choose 2 elements from n + 1 elements. Which we already saw is equal to the sum from k = 1 to n of k, which is the triangular number. Therefore, that's a combinatorial proof.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for triangular numbers. Since t_n = 1 + 2 + ... + n. And the formula for the sum of the first n integers is n(n + 1)/2. Which is equal to C(n + 1, 2). Therefore, that's the algebraic proof.

So perhaps the answer is just to show that the formula for triangular numbers is equivalent to the binomial coefficient. But since the problem says "prove", maybe I need to do that more formally.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the definition of triangular numbers and relate it to binomial coefficients. For example, triangular numbers can be thought of as the number of ways to arrange objects in a triangle, but how does that relate to combinations?

Alternatively, think of the binomial coefficient C(n + 1, 2) as the number of ways to choose two numbers from n + 1 numbers, which is the same as the number of pairs. And the triangular number is the sum of the first n numbers, which counts the number of pairs in a certain way. 

But I think the combinatorial argument I did earlier is sufficient. Let me try to write that more formally.

Let me consider the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n + 1}. The number of ways to choose 2 distinct elements from this set is C(n + 1, 2). On the other hand, each pair can be represented as (i, j) where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n + 1. Now, for each integer k from 1 to n, how many pairs have the second element equal to k + 1? Well, if the second element is k + 1, then the first element can be any number from 1 to k. Therefore, there are k such pairs. Therefore, the total number of pairs is the sum from k = 1 to n of k, which is exactly the nth triangular number t_n. Therefore, C(n + 1, 2) = t_n. 

Therefore, this proves that t_n = C(n + 1, 2). 

Alternatively, if I want to do it algebraically, since t_n = n(n + 1)/2, and C(n + 1, 2) = (n + 1)n / 2, so they are equal. Therefore, t_n = C(n + 1, 2). 

But maybe the problem expects a more formal proof, not just showing that the formulas are the same. However, since the problem says "prove that in terms of the binomial coefficients", maybe they want to show that the triangular number is equal to that binomial coefficient, which is straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe using the definition of binomial coefficients. For example, the binomial coefficient C(n + 1, 2) is defined as (n + 1)n / 2, which is the same as the formula for triangular numbers. Therefore, the equality holds.

But since the problem is in a mathematical context, perhaps the combinatorial proof is more appropriate. Therefore, the answer is that the nth triangular number is equal to the binomial coefficient C(n + 1, 2) because the number of ways to choose two elements from n + 1 elements is equal to the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is the definition of the triangular number.

Therefore, the proof is done by showing that the combinatorial interpretation of the binomial coefficient matches the definition of triangular numbers.

Alternatively, if I want to use the formula for triangular numbers and the formula for binomial coefficients, then since both are equal to n(n + 1)/2, then they are equal. But maybe that's too trivial.

But the problem says "prove that in terms of the binomial coefficients", so maybe they want to express the triangular number as a binomial coefficient. Since the formula for triangular numbers is known to be equal to that binomial coefficient, but perhaps the problem is expecting to derive that relationship.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. For example, using the properties of binomial coefficients. For example, the binomial coefficient C(n + 1, 2) is the same as C(n, 1) + C(n, 2). Wait, no, that's not. The identity is C(n + 1, k) = C(n, k) + C(n, k - 1). So for k = 2, C(n + 1, 2) = C(n, 2) + C(n, 1). Which is equal to [n(n - 1)/2] + n = [n(n - 1) + 2n]/2 = [n^2 - n + 2n]/2 = [n^2 + n]/2 = n(n + 1)/2, which is the triangular number. Therefore, this shows that C(n + 1, 2) is equal to the triangular number. 

But again, this is using the identity of binomial coefficients. So this is another way to see it. Therefore, combining the identity with the formula for triangular numbers, we can show that they are equal.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the student to recall that the formula for triangular numbers is a binomial coefficient. However, since the problem says "prove", I think the combinatorial argument is the way to go.

So, to recap, the triangular number t_n is the sum of the first n natural numbers. This sum can be interpreted as the number of ways to choose two elements from a set of n + 1 elements, which is given by the binomial coefficient C(n + 1, 2). Therefore, t_n = C(n + 1, 2).

Therefore, the proof is established through combinatorial reasoning.

Alternatively, if I want to write this more formally:

We know that the nth triangular number is given by t_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. 

On the other hand, the binomial coefficient C(n + 1, 2) is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of n + 1 elements. 

To count this number, consider the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n + 1}. For each element k in this set, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, the number of pairs where the larger element is k + 1 is k. Therefore, the total number of such pairs is the sum from k = 1 to n of k, which is t_n. 

Therefore, C(n + 1, 2) = t_n. 

Hence, the nth triangular number is equal to the binomial coefficient C(n + 1, 2).

Alternatively, using the formula for the binomial coefficient:

C(n + 1, 2) = (n + 1)! / (2! (n + 1 - 2)!) = (n + 1)! / (2! (n - 1)!)) = [(n + 1) * n * (n - 1)!] / [2 * (n - 1)!)] = (n + 1) * n / 2 = n(n + 1)/2, which is exactly the formula for t_n. Therefore, the equality holds.

Therefore, both algebraic and combinatorial proofs show that t_n = C(n + 1, 2). 

Since the problem says "prove", and given that the question is likely expecting a combinatorial or algebraic proof, either of these would suffice. But since the problem mentions binomial coefficients, the combinatorial proof is more directly related.

So, I think I have covered the necessary steps. The key idea is that the triangular number counts the number of pairs in a certain way, which is equivalent to the binomial coefficient C(n + 1, 2). Therefore, the equality holds.

**Final Answer**
The nth triangular number is equal to the binomial coefficient $\binom{n+1}{2}$, so the proof is \boxed{\binom{n+1}{2}}.

To prove that the $ n $-th triangular number $ t_n $ is equal to the binomial coefficient $ \binom{n+1}{2} $, we begin by recalling the definitions and properties of both the triangular numbers and binomial coefficients.

### **Definition of Triangular Numbers**

The $ n $-th triangular number is the sum of the first $ n $ positive integers:

$$
t_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

This is the standard formula for triangular numbers.

---

### **Definition of Binomial Coefficients**

The binomial coefficient $ \binom{n+1}{2} $ is defined as:

$$
\binom{n+1}{2} = \frac{(n+1)n}{2}
$$

This is derived from the general formula for combinations:

$$
\binom{a}{b} = \frac{a!}{b!(a-b)!}
$$

So, applying this to $ \binom{n+1}{2} $, we get:

$$
\binom{n+1}{2} = \frac{(n+1)!}{2!(n-1)!} = \frac{(n+1)n(n-1)!}{2(n-1)!} = \frac{(n+1)n}{2}
$$

---

### **Equating the Two Expressions**

From the above, we see that:

$$
t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \binom{n+1}{2}
$$

Therefore, the two expressions are algebraically equivalent.

---

### **Combinatorial Interpretation (Optional but Insightful)**

We can also interpret the triangular number $ t_n $ combinatorially. Consider the set of numbers $ \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n+1\} $. The number of ways to choose 2 elements from this set is:

$$
\binom{n+1}{2}
$$

Each such pair corresponds to an unordered pair $ (i, j) $ with $ 1 \leq i < j \leq n+1 $. The number of such pairs is equal to the number of elements in the sum $ 1 + 2 + \cdots + n $, which is the definition of the $ n $-th triangular number. Therefore, we have:

$$
\binom{n+1}{2} = t_n
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Both algebraically and combinatorially, we have shown that the $ n $-th triangular number is equal to the binomial coefficient $ \binom{n+1}{2} $. This completes the proof.

$$
\boxed{\binom{n+1}{2}}
$$
