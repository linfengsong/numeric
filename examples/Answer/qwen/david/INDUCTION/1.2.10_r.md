Okay, so I need to prove that the Catalan numbers can be defined inductively by the formula $ C_n = \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n + 1} C_{n-1} $ for $ n \geq 1 $. Let me start by recalling what the Catalan numbers are. They are given by $ C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} $, which is also equal to $ \frac{(2n)!}{n!(n+1)!} $. 

First, I should check if this inductive formula holds for the initial terms. Let me compute $ C_1 $ using both the standard formula and the inductive formula. 

For $ n = 1 $, the standard formula gives $ C_1 = \frac{1}{2} \binom{2}{1} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 $. 

Now using the inductive formula, since $ C_0 $ is 1 (because $ C_0 = \frac{1}{1} \binom{0}{0} = 1 $), then $ C_1 = \frac{2(2*1 - 1)}{1 + 1} C_0 = \frac{2(1)}{2} * 1 = 1 $. That checks out. 

Let me check $ n = 2 $. Standard formula: $ C_2 = \frac{1}{3} \binom{4}{2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 $. 

Using the inductive formula: $ C_2 = \frac{2(2*2 - 1)}{2 + 1} C_1 = \frac{2(3)}{3} * 1 = 2 * 1 = 2 $. Also checks out. 

How about $ n = 3 $? Standard formula: $ C_3 = \frac{1}{4} \binom{6}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 $. 

Inductive formula: $ C_3 = \frac{2(2*3 - 1)}{3 + 1} C_2 = \frac{2(5)}{4} * 2 = \frac{10}{4} * 2 = \frac{10}{2} = 5 $. Perfect. 

So the formula works for the first few terms. But I need to prove it for all $ n \geq 1 $. Let me think about how to approach this. 

The standard formula is $ C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} $. The inductive formula is $ C_n = \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n + 1} C_{n-1} $. 

So maybe I can take the ratio $ \frac{C_n}{C_{n-1}} $ and see if it equals $ \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n + 1} $. 

Let me compute $ \frac{C_n}{C_{n-1}} $ using the standard formula. 

$ C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} $, and $ C_{n-1} = \frac{1}{n} \binom{2(n-1)}{n-1} = \frac{1}{n} \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} $.

Therefore, the ratio is:

$ \frac{C_n}{C_{n-1}} = \frac{ \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} }{ \frac{1}{n} \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} } = \frac{n}{n + 1} \times \frac{ \binom{2n}{n} }{ \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} } $.

Now, I need to compute that binomial coefficient ratio. Let me recall that $ \binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{n!n!} $, and $ \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} = \frac{(2n - 2)!}{(n - 1)! (n - 1)!} $. 

So the ratio becomes:

$ \frac{(2n)!}{n!n!} \div \frac{(2n - 2)!}{(n - 1)! (n - 1)!} = \frac{(2n)!}{n!n!} \times \frac{(n - 1)! (n - 1)!}{(2n - 2)!} $.

Simplify this:

First, note that $ (2n)! = (2n)(2n - 1)(2n - 2)! $. Therefore, substituting that in:

$ \frac{(2n)(2n - 1)(2n - 2)!}{n!n!} \times \frac{(n - 1)! (n - 1)!}{(2n - 2)!} $.

The $ (2n - 2)! $ cancels out, so we have:

$ \frac{2n(2n - 1)}{n!n!} \times (n - 1)! (n - 1)! $.

Now, $ n! = n \times (n - 1)! $, so substituting:

$ \frac{2n(2n - 1)}{ [n \times (n - 1)! ] [n \times (n - 1)! ] } \times (n - 1)! (n - 1)! $.

Simplify denominator: $ n^2 \times [(n - 1)!]^2 $.

So the entire expression becomes:

$ \frac{2n(2n - 1)}{n^2 [(n - 1)!]^2} \times [(n - 1)!]^2 $.

The $ [(n - 1)!]^2 $ cancels out, leaving:

$ \frac{2n(2n - 1)}{n^2} = \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n} $.

Therefore, going back to the ratio $ \frac{C_n}{C_{n-1}} $, we had:

$ \frac{n}{n + 1} \times \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n} = \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n + 1} $.

Which is exactly the inductive formula! Therefore, $ C_n = \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n + 1} C_{n - 1} $. 

So that proves the inductive formula. 

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using the recursive definition of Catalan numbers. But since the problem says to prove it for $ n \geq 1 $, and given that the standard formula is known, this approach using the ratio seems valid. 

Alternatively, another way to think about Catalan numbers is through their recursive definition. Catalan numbers count the number of Dyck paths, correct? Or the number of valid parenthesis expressions, which is the example given. 

But maybe I can think recursively. Suppose we have $ C_n $ ways to parenthesize $ n + 1 $ factors. If we fix the first operation, say, we first multiply the first k factors and then multiply the remaining $ n + 1 - k $ factors, but I need to think about how that would lead to the recurrence. 

Wait, the standard recursive formula for Catalan numbers is $ C_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} C_i C_{n - 1 - i} $, which is the number of ways to split the product into two parts. But here the inductive formula is different. 

But the problem is not asking for that standard recurrence, but rather a different one: $ C_n = \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n + 1} C_{n - 1} $. 

So maybe we can use the standard formula and show that the ratio is as given, which is what I did above. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use induction. Let me try that approach as well. 

Base case: n = 1, which we checked earlier, works. 

Assume that for some $ k \geq 1 $, $ C_k = \frac{2(2k - 1)}{k + 1} C_{k - 1} $. Then need to show that $ C_{k + 1} = \frac{2(2(k + 1) - 1)}{(k + 1) + 1} C_k $. 

But maybe that's more complicated. Wait, but if I can use the formula from the standard Catalan numbers, then the ratio approach is straightforward. 

Alternatively, maybe I can write the formula for $ C_n $ using the standard formula and then express it in terms of $ C_{n - 1} $. 

Let me write $ C_n = \frac{1}{n + 1} \binom{2n}{n} $. Let me express $ \binom{2n}{n} $ in terms of $ \binom{2(n - 1)}{n - 1} $. 

We know that $ \binom{2n}{n} = \frac{2n(2n - 1)}{n^2} \binom{2(n - 1)}{n - 1} $. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. 

Wait, $ \binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{n!n!} $, and $ \binom{2(n - 1)}{n - 1} = \frac{(2n - 2)!}{(n - 1)! (n - 1)!} $. Then, $ \frac{\binom{2n}{n}}{\binom{2n - 2}{n - 1}} = \frac{(2n)!}{n!n!} \times \frac{(n - 1)! (n - 1)!}{(2n - 2)!} = \frac{2n(2n - 1)(2n - 2)!}{n!n!} \times \frac{(n - 1)! (n - 1)!}{(2n - 2)!} $. 

Which simplifies to $ \frac{2n(2n - 1)}{n^2} $, as before. Therefore, $ \binom{2n}{n} = \frac{2n(2n - 1)}{n^2} \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} $. 

Therefore, substituting back into $ C_n $:

$ C_n = \frac{1}{n + 1} \times \frac{2n(2n - 1)}{n^2} \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} $.

But $ \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} = n! / ( (n - 1)! (n - 1)! ) \times (2n - 2)! $? Wait, no. Wait, $ C_{n - 1} = \frac{1}{n} \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} $. Therefore, $ \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} = n C_{n - 1} $. 

Therefore, substituting that into the expression for $ C_n $:

$ C_n = \frac{1}{n + 1} \times \frac{2n(2n - 1)}{n^2} \times n C_{n - 1} $.

Simplify:

The $ n $ in the numerator and denominator cancels:

$ \frac{1}{n + 1} \times \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n} \times n C_{n - 1} $.

The $ n $ cancels:

$ \frac{1}{n + 1} \times 2(2n - 1) C_{n - 1} $.

Which is exactly the formula given: $ C_n = \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n + 1} C_{n - 1} $.

Therefore, this proves the inductive formula. 

Alternatively, if I didn't remember the binomial coefficient ratio, I could have used the recursive formula for Catalan numbers. But since the problem is to prove the inductive formula, and given that the standard formula is known, this approach is valid. 

Another way: Let me think about the generating function for Catalan numbers. The generating function $ C(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} C_n x^n $ satisfies the equation $ C(x) = 1 + x C(x)^2 $. But maybe that's more complicated. However, if I can derive the recurrence from the generating function, but that might not be necessary here. 

Alternatively, maybe using the explicit formula and manipulating it. But the way I did it above seems straightforward. 

So, in conclusion, by expressing the ratio $ C_n / C_{n - 1} $ using the explicit formula for Catalan numbers, we find that the ratio simplifies to $ \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n + 1} $, which gives the inductive formula. Therefore, the inductive formula is proven. 

I think that's solid. Let me check once more for n=4. 

Standard formula: $ C_4 = \frac{1}{5} \binom{8}{4} = \frac{1}{5} \times 70 = 14 $. 

Using the inductive formula: $ C_4 = \frac{2(2*4 - 1)}{4 + 1} C_3 = \frac{2*7}{5} * 5 = \frac{14}{5} * 5 = 14 $. Correct. 

So, the formula works here as well. Therefore, the proof is correct. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{C_n = \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n + 1} C_{n-1}}

To prove that the Catalan numbers $ C_n $ for $ n \geq 1 $ satisfy the inductive formula

$$
C_n = \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n + 1} C_{n - 1},
$$

we begin with the standard definition of the Catalan numbers:

$$
C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}.
$$

### Step 1: Compute the Ratio $ \frac{C_n}{C_{n-1}} $

We compute the ratio of consecutive Catalan numbers using the standard formula:

$$
\frac{C_n}{C_{n-1}} = \frac{ \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} }{ \frac{1}{n} \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} } = \frac{n}{n + 1} \cdot \frac{ \binom{2n}{n} }{ \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} }.
$$

Now, express the binomial coefficients:

$$
\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{n!n!}, \quad \binom{2n - 2}{n - 1} = \frac{(2n - 2)!}{(n - 1)!^2}.
$$

So the ratio becomes:

$$
\frac{C_n}{C_{n-1}} = \frac{n}{n + 1} \cdot \frac{(2n)!}{n!n!} \cdot \frac{(n - 1)!^2}{(2n - 2)!}.
$$

Using the identity $ (2n)! = (2n)(2n - 1)(2n - 2)! $, we simplify:

$$
\frac{C_n}{C_{n-1}} = \frac{n}{n + 1} \cdot \frac{2n(2n - 1)(2n - 2)!}{n!n!} \cdot \frac{(n - 1)!^2}{(2n - 2)!}.
$$

Cancel $ (2n - 2)! $, and note that $ n! = n \cdot (n - 1)! $, so:

$$
\frac{C_n}{C_{n-1}} = \frac{n}{n + 1} \cdot \frac{2n(2n - 1)}{n^2} \cdot (n - 1)!^2 \cdot \frac{1}{(n - 1)!^2} = \frac{n}{n + 1} \cdot \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n}.
$$

Simplify:

$$
\frac{C_n}{C_{n-1}} = \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n + 1}.
$$

---

### Step 2: Conclude the Inductive Formula

Therefore, we find that:

$$
C_n = \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n + 1} C_{n - 1},
$$

which is the desired inductive formula.

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{C_n = \frac{2(2n - 1)}{n + 1} C_{n-1}}
$$
