Okay, so I need to prove the Bernoulli inequality, which states that if 1 + a > 0, then (1 + a)^n ≥ 1 + na for all n ≥ 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that inequalities often can be proven using mathematical induction. Maybe I should try that method?

First, let me recall what mathematical induction is. It's a method where you prove a base case (usually n=1) and then show that if the statement holds for some integer k, it must also hold for k+1. That way, by induction, it's true for all n ≥ 1. Let me try that.

Starting with the base case, n = 1. The left side of the inequality is (1 + a)^1 = 1 + a. The right side is 1 + 1*a = 1 + a. So, 1 + a ≥ 1 + a is obviously true. So the base case holds.

Now, the inductive step. Assume that the inequality holds for some integer k ≥ 1, meaning (1 + a)^k ≥ 1 + ka. Now, I need to show that (1 + a)^{k+1} ≥ 1 + (k + 1)a.

Let me write down (1 + a)^{k+1}. That's equal to (1 + a)^k * (1 + a). By the inductive hypothesis, (1 + a)^k is at least 1 + ka. So, multiplying both sides by (1 + a), we get:

(1 + a)^{k+1} ≥ (1 + ka)(1 + a).

Now, I need to show that (1 + ka)(1 + a) is greater than or equal to 1 + (k + 1)a. Let me expand the left side:

(1 + ka)(1 + a) = 1*(1 + a) + ka*(1 + a) = 1 + a + ka + ka^2.

Simplify that: 1 + a + ka + ka^2 = 1 + a(1 + k) + ka^2.

So, 1 + (k + 1)a + ka^2. Therefore, we have:

(1 + a)^{k+1} ≥ 1 + (k + 1)a + ka^2.

But we need to show that this is ≥ 1 + (k + 1)a. Well, since ka^2 is non-negative? Wait, is that true?

Hold on, the condition given is that 1 + a > 0. But does that imply that a is greater than -1? Yes, because 1 + a > 0 implies a > -1. However, a could be negative, but not less than or equal to -1. But then, if a is negative, then a^2 is still positive, right? So, ka^2 is non-negative because k is a positive integer (since n ≥ 1, and k ≥ 1). Therefore, ka^2 ≥ 0. Therefore, 1 + (k + 1)a + ka^2 ≥ 1 + (k + 1)a. Therefore, (1 + a)^{k+1} ≥ 1 + (k + 1)a. So that completes the inductive step.

Wait, but hold on. What if a is negative? Let me check with an example. Suppose a = -0.5, which is greater than -1, so 1 + a = 0.5 > 0. Let me test n=2. Then, (1 - 0.5)^2 = 0.25. On the other hand, 1 + 2*(-0.5) = 1 - 1 = 0. So 0.25 ≥ 0, which is true. For n=3, (1 - 0.5)^3 = 0.125. 1 + 3*(-0.5) = 1 - 1.5 = -0.5. 0.125 ≥ -0.5, which is true. So even when a is negative, the inequality holds. So, even though a is negative, the term ka^2 is positive, so adding it makes the left side larger. Therefore, the inequality holds.

But wait, let me think again. If a is negative, but greater than -1, then maybe there's a case where ka^2 is positive, but maybe the original inequality is still true. So, the inductive step seems okay.

But maybe there's another way to prove this without induction? Maybe using the binomial theorem? Let me try that approach as well to verify.

Expanding (1 + a)^n using the binomial theorem gives:

(1 + a)^n = Σ_{k=0}^n C(n, k) a^k.

Which is 1 + na + [n(n - 1)/2! a^2 + ... + a^n].

So, if we compare this to 1 + na, the difference is the sum of the terms from the second term onwards. So, (1 + a)^n - (1 + na) = Σ_{k=2}^n C(n, k) a^k.

Now, if a ≥ 0, then all the terms in the sum are non-negative, so the entire expression is non-negative, hence (1 + a)^n ≥ 1 + na. But if a is negative, then some terms might be negative. However, the condition is that 1 + a > 0, so a > -1. So, even if a is negative, we need to check whether the sum is non-negative.

But how can we show that? Let me think. For example, if a is between -1 and 0, then a^2 is positive, and higher powers of a are positive or negative depending on the exponent. However, the binomial expansion for (1 + a)^n includes terms with a^2, a^3, etc. But since a is between -1 and 0, maybe the sum is still non-negative?

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that for a > -1, the terms in the expansion after the first two terms are non-negative? Wait, no. For example, if a is negative, say a = -b where 0 < b < 1, then (1 - b)^n. The expansion would be 1 - nb + n(n - 1)/2! b^2 - ... + (-1)^n b^n. So, the terms alternate in sign. Therefore, the difference between (1 + a)^n and 1 + na would be the sum of those alternating terms. But how do we know that this sum is non-negative?

But in the original problem, we have the condition that 1 + a > 0, which is equivalent to a > -1. However, the Bernoulli inequality is known to hold for a ≥ -1, but here the condition is 1 + a > 0, which is a > -1. Wait, but if a = -1, then 1 + a = 0, which is not allowed. So, the inequality is for a > -1. However, when a is between -1 and 0, the binomial expansion has alternating signs. How do we know that the sum is non-negative?

But in the inductive proof, we didn't have to worry about that because we used the inductive hypothesis and showed that adding ka^2 makes it larger. So maybe the inductive approach is better here.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that if a > -1, then (1 + a)^n - 1 - na is non-negative. But how?

Alternatively, maybe we can use the inequality for real numbers. For example, if we can show that (1 + a)^n ≥ 1 + na for all n ≥ 1, given that a > -1.

But perhaps another approach is to use the fact that the function f(n) = (1 + a)^n is convex, so that the inequality holds? But I need to think more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that for a > -1, the sequence (1 + a)^n is increasing if a > 0, and for a between -1 and 0, it's decreasing? Wait, but the inequality is (1 + a)^n ≥ 1 + na. For example, when a is negative, but greater than -1, let's take a = -0.5 and n = 2, as before, (1 - 0.5)^2 = 0.25, and 1 + 2*(-0.5) = 0. So 0.25 ≥ 0. For n = 3, 0.125 ≥ -0.5, which is true. For n = 4, (0.5)^4 = 0.0625, and 1 + 4*(-0.5) = 1 - 2 = -1. So 0.0625 ≥ -1, which is true. So even though the right-hand side is decreasing, the left side is positive, so the inequality holds.

But how can we show that in general? Maybe for a > -1, the term (1 + a)^n is always greater than or equal to 1 + na. But how?

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of convexity or monotonicity. But I think the induction approach is more straightforward here.

Wait, but in the inductive step, when we expanded (1 + ka)(1 + a) and found that it equals 1 + (k + 1)a + ka^2, and since ka^2 is non-negative, then (1 + a)^{k + 1} ≥ 1 + (k + 1)a. Therefore, the inductive step holds.

But why is ka^2 non-negative? Because k is a positive integer (since n ≥ 1, and we're considering k ≥ 1) and a^2 is always non-negative. Therefore, ka^2 ≥ 0. Therefore, adding that term makes the expression larger. Therefore, the inequality holds.

Therefore, by induction, the inequality holds for all n ≥ 1.

But let me check for a case where a is negative. Let's take a = -0.5, n = 2. Then (1 - 0.5)^2 = 0.25, and 1 + 2*(-0.5) = 0. So 0.25 ≥ 0. True. For n = 3, (1 - 0.5)^3 = 0.125, and 1 + 3*(-0.5) = -0.5. 0.125 ≥ -0.5. True. For n = 4, 0.0625 ≥ -1. True. So even though the right-hand side is negative, the left-hand side is positive, so the inequality holds.

But what if a is very close to -1? Let's take a = -0.9, which is greater than -1. Let's check n = 2. (1 - 0.9)^2 = 0.01. 1 + 2*(-0.9) = 1 - 1.8 = -0.8. 0.01 ≥ -0.8. True. For n = 3, (0.1)^3 = 0.001, and 1 + 3*(-0.9) = 1 - 2.7 = -1.7. 0.001 ≥ -1.7. True. So even when a approaches -1, the left side is positive, and the right side is negative, so the inequality holds.

But what if a is between -1 and 0, and n is large? For example, a = -0.5, n = 10. Then (1 - 0.5)^10 = (0.5)^10 = 1/1024 ≈ 0.0009766. On the other hand, 1 + 10*(-0.5) = 1 - 5 = -4. So 0.0009766 ≥ -4. True. So even for large n, the left side is positive, and the right side is negative, so the inequality holds.

But if a is between -1 and 0, then (1 + a)^n is positive, but 1 + na could be negative or positive depending on n. However, since a > -1, then for n such that na > -1, 1 + na is positive. But if na < -1, then 1 + na is negative. However, since (1 + a)^n is positive, the inequality holds.

But if a is between -1 and 0, then for some n, 1 + na could be positive or negative. However, the inequality is still true because (1 + a)^n is positive and 1 + na is either positive or negative. So if 1 + na is positive, then since (1 + a)^n ≥ 1 + na? Wait, but when a is negative, for example, a = -0.5, n = 2: 1 + na = 1 - 1 = 0, and (1 + a)^n = 0.25 ≥ 0. True. For n = 1: 1 + a = 0.5 ≥ 0.5. True. For n = 3: 1 + 3*(-0.5) = -0.5, and (1 + a)^3 = 0.125 ≥ -0.5. True. So even when 1 + na is negative, the left side is positive, so the inequality holds.

Therefore, the inductive proof seems solid. But let me check another case where a is positive. Let's take a = 2, n = 3. (1 + 2)^3 = 27. 1 + 3*2 = 7. 27 ≥ 7. True. For n = 4: 81 ≥ 1 + 4*2 = 9. True. So that works.

Another example: a = 0. Then (1 + 0)^n = 1, and 1 + n*0 = 1. So equality holds. Which is correct.

What if a = 1? Then (1 + 1)^n = 2^n, and 1 + n*1 = n + 1. For n = 1: 2 ≥ 2. True. For n = 2: 4 ≥ 3. True. For n = 3: 8 ≥ 4. True. So that works.

Therefore, the inductive proof seems to hold in all these cases.

But let me check the inductive step again. Suppose that (1 + a)^k ≥ 1 + ka. Then (1 + a)^{k + 1} = (1 + a)^k * (1 + a) ≥ (1 + ka)(1 + a) = 1 + a + ka + ka^2 = 1 + (k + 1)a + ka^2. Since ka^2 ≥ 0, then 1 + (k + 1)a + ka^2 ≥ 1 + (k + 1)a. Therefore, (1 + a)^{k + 1} ≥ 1 + (k + 1)a. Therefore, the inductive step is valid.

Therefore, the inequality holds for all n ≥ 1.

But wait, what if a is negative? Let me take a = -0.5, k = 1. Then (1 + a)^1 = 0.5, and 1 + 1*a = 0.5. So equality holds. Then for k = 2, (1 + a)^2 = 0.25. According to the inductive step, (1 + ka)(1 + a) = (1 + (-1))(1 + (-0.5)) = (0)(0.5) = 0. But wait, that seems different. Wait, no. Wait, in the inductive step, the inductive hypothesis is (1 + a)^k ≥ 1 + ka. For k = 1, we have (1 + a)^1 = 1 + a ≥ 1 + 1*a, which is equality. Then, for k = 1, (1 + a)^{k + 1} = (1 + a)^2. According to the inductive step, we have (1 + ka)(1 + a) = (1 + 1*a)(1 + a) = (1 + a)^2. Wait, but that's exactly (1 + a)^2. So, in this case, we have (1 + a)^{k + 1} = (1 + ka)(1 + a). But since (1 + a)^k is equal to 1 + ka, then multiplying by (1 + a) gives (1 + a)^{k + 1}. But in this case, since (1 + a)^k = 1 + ka, then (1 + a)^{k + 1} = (1 + ka)(1 + a) = 1 + (k + 1)a + ka^2. Which is equal to 1 + (k + 1)a + ka^2. So even when a is negative, this is still true. For example, with a = -0.5, k = 1: 1 + (1 + 1)a + 1*a^2 = 1 + 2*(-0.5) + 1*(0.25) = 1 - 1 + 0.25 = 0.25, which is equal to (1 - 0.5)^2 = 0.25. So that works. Therefore, even when a is negative, the inductive step is valid.

Therefore, the inductive proof is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. For example, using the fact that if a > -1, then 1 + a is positive, and we can take logarithms? But that might complicate things because logarithms are only defined for positive numbers, but since 1 + a > 0, that's okay. However, taking logarithms might not be straightforward because the inequality is multiplicative on the left side and additive on the right side. Maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of the exponential function? But that might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, considering the function f(n) = (1 + a)^n - 1 - na. We can show that f(n) ≥ 0 for all n ≥ 1. For n = 1, f(1) = 0. For n ≥ 2, maybe we can show that f(n) is increasing or something? But I think induction is the most straightforward here.

Therefore, I think the induction proof is solid. Therefore, the Bernoulli inequality holds under the given conditions.

Wait, but let me check another edge case. What if a = -0.99, which is just above -1. Let's take n = 2. Then (1 - 0.99)^2 = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001. On the other hand, 1 + 2*(-0.99) = 1 - 1.98 = -0.98. So 0.0001 ≥ -0.98, which is true. For n = 100, (1 - 0.99)^100 = (0.01)^100, which is a very small positive number, and 1 + 100*(-0.99) = 1 - 99 = -98. So again, the left side is positive, so the inequality holds. So even when a is very close to -1, the inequality holds.

Therefore, I think the induction proof is correct. Therefore, the Bernoulli inequality is proven.

**Final Answer**
The Bernoulli inequality is proven by mathematical induction, and the result is \boxed{(1 + a)^n \geq 1 + na} for all $ n \geq 1 $ when $ 1 + a > 0 $.
</think>

To prove the **Bernoulli inequality**:

$$
(1 + a)^n \geq 1 + na \quad \text{for all } n \geq 1 \text{ and } 1 + a > 0,
$$

we proceed using **mathematical induction**.

---

### **Base Case: $ n = 1 $**

We begin with the base case:

$$
(1 + a)^1 = 1 + a, \quad \text{and} \quad 1 + 1 \cdot a = 1 + a.
$$

So, the inequality becomes:

$$
1 + a \geq 1 + a,
$$

which is clearly **true**.

---

### **Inductive Step: Assume the inequality holds for some integer $ k \geq 1 $, i.e.,**

$$
(1 + a)^k \geq 1 + ka.
$$

We now aim to show that the inequality holds for $ k + 1 $, that is:

$$
(1 + a)^{k+1} \geq 1 + (k + 1)a.
$$

We start by expressing $ (1 + a)^{k+1} $ as:

$$
(1 + a)^{k+1} = (1 + a)^k \cdot (1 + a).
$$

Using the inductive hypothesis, we know:

$$
(1 + a)^k \geq 1 + ka.
$$

Now, multiplying both sides by $ (1 + a) $, we get:

$$
(1 + a)^{k+1} \geq (1 + ka)(1 + a).
$$

Expanding the right-hand side:

$$
(1 + ka)(1 + a) = 1 \cdot (1 + a) + ka \cdot (1 + a) = 1 + a + ka + ka^2.
$$

Grouping terms:

$$
(1 + ka)(1 + a) = 1 + (k + 1)a + ka^2.
$$

So we have:

$$
(1 + a)^{k+1} \geq 1 + (k + 1)a + ka^2.
$$

Now, note that $ ka^2 \geq 0 $ for all $ k \geq 1 $ and $ a \in \mathbb{R} $, since $ a^2 \geq 0 $. Therefore:

$$
1 + (k + 1)a + ka^2 \geq 1 + (k + 1)a.
$$

Thus, the inequality holds for $ k + 1 $, completing the inductive step.

---

### **Conclusion**

By the principle of mathematical induction, the inequality

$$
(1 + a)^n \geq 1 + na
$$

holds for all integers $ n \geq 1 $, given that $ 1 + a > 0 $.

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{(1 + a)^n \geq 1 + na}
$$
