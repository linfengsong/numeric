Okay, so I need to prove that for any integer n greater than 1, the inequality 2^n < binomial(2n, n) < 2^{2n} holds. Let me start by recalling what the binomial coefficient binomial(2n, n) represents. It's the number of ways to choose n elements from a set of 2n elements. 

First, I know that 2^{2n} is the same as (2^n)^2. Also, binomial(2n, n) is the middle term of the expansion of (1 + 1)^{2n} by the binomial theorem. Wait, actually, the binomial theorem says that (a + b)^{2n} equals the sum from k=0 to 2n of binomial(2n, k) * a^{2n - k} * b^k. If I set a = 1 and b = 1, then (1 + 1)^{2n} = sum_{k=0}^{2n} binomial(2n, k) = 2^{2n}. So that tells me that the sum of all binomial coefficients for (2n choose k) is 2^{2n}. 

But how does that help me with the middle term? Well, the middle term is binomial(2n, n), which is the largest term in the expansion because the binomial coefficients are symmetric and increase up to the middle term. So, if the sum of all terms is 2^{2n}, and there are 2n + 1 terms, then each term is less than 2^{2n} divided by (2n + 1). But wait, that might not be directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can compare binomial(2n, n) with 2^{2n}?

But the problem says that binomial(2n, n) is less than 2^{2n}, which is obvious because the sum of all binomial coefficients is 2^{2n}, and binomial(2n, n) is just one term. However, the other inequality is 2^n < binomial(2n, n). So I need to show that the middle term is greater than 2^n. 

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe using induction? Or maybe using some known inequalities for binomial coefficients?

Alternatively, I can use the formula for binomial coefficients. Let's recall that binomial(2n, n) = (2n)! / (n! * n!). So maybe I can compare this to 2^n and 2^{2n}?

First, let me check for small values of n. Let's take n = 2. Then binomial(4, 2) = 6. 2^2 = 4, and 2^{4} = 16. So 4 < 6 < 16, which holds. For n = 3: binomial(6, 3) = 20. 2^3 = 8, 2^6 = 64. 8 < 20 < 64. So that works. For n = 1, though, the problem says n > 1, so n=1 is not considered. 

But maybe I can use mathematical induction. Let's try that. 

Base case: n = 2. As above, 6 is between 4 and 16. So it holds. Now assume that for some n = k > 1, the inequality holds: 2^k < binomial(2k, k) < 2^{2k}. Then need to show that for n = k + 1, 2^{k + 1} < binomial(2(k + 1), k + 1) < 2^{2(k + 1)}. 

But I need to relate binomial(2(k + 1), k + 1) to binomial(2k, k). Maybe using the recursive formula for binomial coefficients? The recursive formula is binomial(n, k) = binomial(n - 1, k - 1) + binomial(n - 1, k). But I don't know if that's helpful here. Alternatively, there's a formula for binomial(2n, n) in terms of previous terms?

Alternatively, maybe using the ratio between consecutive binomial coefficients. For example, binomial(2n, n) / binomial(2(n - 1), n - 1). Let me compute that. 

Let me compute binomial(2n, n) / binomial(2(n - 1), n - 1). 

First, binomial(2n, n) = (2n)! / (n! n!). 

binomial(2(n - 1), n - 1) = [2(n - 1)]! / [(n - 1)! (n - 1)!].

So the ratio is [ (2n)! / (n! n!) ] / [ (2n - 2)! / ((n - 1)! (n - 1)! ) ] = [ (2n)(2n - 1)(2n - 2)! / (n! n!) ] * [ (n - 1)! (n - 1)! ) / (2n - 2)! ) ] 

Simplify this: 

The (2n - 2)! cancels out. 

So we have [2n(2n - 1) ] / [n! / (n - 1)! )^2 ] 

Wait, n! = n*(n - 1)! So n! / (n - 1)! = n. Therefore, denominator is [n * (n - 1)! ]^2? Wait, no. Wait, the denominator is n! * n! = [n*(n - 1)!]^2. The numerator is 2n(2n - 1) * (n - 1)!^2. 

Therefore, the ratio becomes [2n(2n - 1) * (n - 1)!^2 ] / [n^2 * (n - 1)!^2 ] = [2n(2n - 1)] / n^2 = 2(2n - 1)/n = 4 - 2/n.

Therefore, binomial(2n, n) = binomial(2(n - 1), n - 1) * (4 - 2/n). 

So if I denote B(n) = binomial(2n, n), then B(n) = B(n - 1) * (4 - 2/n). 

So if I can show that B(n) > 2^n, given that B(n - 1) > 2^{n - 1}, then maybe?

Let me try. Suppose that B(n - 1) > 2^{n - 1}. Then B(n) = B(n - 1) * (4 - 2/n) > 2^{n - 1} * (4 - 2/n). 

So need to check if 2^{n - 1} * (4 - 2/n) > 2^n. 

Divide both sides by 2^{n - 1}: 4 - 2/n > 2. 

Which simplifies to 4 - 2/n > 2 => 2 - 2/n > 0 => 2(1 - 1/n) > 0. 

Since n > 1, 1 - 1/n is positive (because 1/n < 1). Therefore, 2(1 - 1/n) > 0. Hence, the inequality holds. Therefore, if B(n - 1) > 2^{n - 1}, then B(n) > 2^n. 

Therefore, by induction, since the base case n = 2 holds, then for all n >= 2, B(n) > 2^n. 

So that takes care of the left inequality. Now for the right inequality, binomial(2n, n) < 2^{2n}. 

Well, as I thought earlier, the sum of all binomial coefficients for (1 + 1)^{2n} is 2^{2n}, and binomial(2n, n) is one of the terms. However, since the binomial coefficients are symmetric and the middle term is the largest, then binomial(2n, n) is less than 2^{2n} because there are multiple terms. But maybe I need a more precise argument?

Alternatively, note that binomial(2n, n) is equal to the number of ways to choose n elements from 2n, which is less than the total number of subsets, which is 2^{2n}. So that's a trivial argument. But maybe the problem expects a more rigorous proof?

Alternatively, using the formula for binomial coefficients. Let's note that binomial(2n, n) = (2n)(2n - 1)...(n + 1)/n! 

So let's compute this. Let me write it as:

binomial(2n, n) = product_{k=1}^n (n + k)/k 

Wait, let me check. 

The numerator is (2n)(2n - 1)...(n + 1). The denominator is n! 

Alternatively, we can write binomial(2n, n) = product_{k=1}^n (2n - k + 1)/k 

But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, note that binomial(2n, n) is equal to the product from k=1 to n of (2n - k + 1)/k. 

Alternatively, let me think of it as:

binomial(2n, n) = (2n)! / (n! n!) 

But 2^{2n} is (2^n)^2. So maybe compare (2n)! / (n! n!) with (2^n)^2?

Alternatively, use Stirling's approximation? But that might be too advanced. Alternatively, use the fact that binomial(2n, n) is the largest term in the binomial expansion, and since the sum of all terms is 2^{2n}, then each term is less than 2^{2n}. But since there are 2n + 1 terms, each term is less than 2^{2n}/(2n + 1). But then binomial(2n, n) is less than 2^{2n}/(2n + 1), which is less than 2^{2n}. So that's a valid argument. 

But maybe the problem expects a more elementary proof? Let me think. 

Alternatively, use induction again. Suppose that for n, binomial(2n, n) < 2^{2n}. Then for n + 1, binomial(2(n + 1), n + 1) = binomial(2n + 2, n + 1). How does this relate to binomial(2n, n)? 

Using the recursive formula: binomial(2n + 2, n + 1) = binomial(2n + 1, n) + binomial(2n + 1, n + 1). But binomial(2n + 1, n) = binomial(2n + 1, n + 1) because of symmetry. So binomial(2n + 2, n + 1) = 2 * binomial(2n + 1, n). 

But binomial(2n + 1, n) = (2n + 1)! / (n! (n + 1)!)) 

Alternatively, maybe relate it to binomial(2n, n). Let me compute binomial(2n + 2, n + 1) / binomial(2n, n). 

So that ratio is [ (2n + 2)! / ( (n + 1)! (n + 1)! ) ] / [ (2n)! / (n! n! ) ] = [ (2n + 2)(2n + 1)(2n)! / ( (n + 1)^2 (n!)^2 ) ] * [ n!^2 / (2n)! ) ] = [ (2n + 2)(2n + 1) ] / (n + 1)^2 = [ 2(n + 1)(2n + 1) ] / (n + 1)^2 ) = 2(2n + 1)/(n + 1) 

So binomial(2n + 2, n + 1) = binomial(2n, n) * 2(2n + 1)/(n + 1). 

Therefore, if we have binomial(2n, n) < 2^{2n}, then binomial(2n + 2, n + 1) < 2^{2n} * 2(2n + 1)/(n + 1). 

But we need to show that binomial(2n + 2, n + 1) < 2^{2(n + 1)} = 4 * 2^{2n}. 

Therefore, we need to check if 2(2n + 1)/(n + 1) < 4. 

Simplify: 2(2n + 1)/(n + 1) < 4 

Divide both sides by 2: (2n + 1)/(n + 1) < 2 

Multiply both sides by (n + 1): 2n + 1 < 2(n + 1) 

Simplify: 2n + 1 < 2n + 2 

Which is true, since 1 < 2. 

Therefore, the ratio is less than 4, so binomial(2n + 2, n + 1) < 4 * 2^{2n} = 2^{2(n + 1)}. 

Therefore, by induction, if the inequality holds for n, it holds for n + 1. Since the base case n = 2, binomial(4, 2) = 6 < 16 = 2^4, which is true. Hence, by induction, the upper bound holds. 

Therefore, combining both inequalities, we have 2^n < binomial(2n, n) < 2^{2n} for all n > 1. 

Wait, but I need to check the base case for the upper bound. For n = 2, 2^{2*2} = 16, and binomial(4, 2) = 6 < 16. So yes, holds. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a more direct way to show the upper bound? For example, using the fact that binomial(2n, n) is the number of subsets of size n from a set of size 2n, which is less than the total number of subsets, which is 2^{2n}. But that's a bit hand-wavy. However, since each term in the binomial expansion is less than 2^{2n}, but actually, the sum is 2^{2n}, so each term is less than 2^{2n} because there are multiple terms. 

But maybe the problem expects a more rigorous proof. However, the induction approach seems solid. 

Alternatively, using the formula for binomial coefficients. Let's think about the ratio binomial(2n, n)/2^{2n}. 

We can write binomial(2n, n)/2^{2n} = (2n)! / (n! n! 2^{2n}) 

But I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, using the central binomial coefficient. 

Alternatively, using the inequality that binomial(2n, n) is greater than 2^{2n}/(2n + 1). Wait, earlier I thought that because the sum is 2^{2n}, and there are 2n + 1 terms, each term is less than 2^{2n}/(2n + 1). But actually, the middle term is the largest, so binomial(2n, n) is greater than 2^{2n}/(2n + 1). But that would mean that binomial(2n, n) is less than 2^{2n}, which is true. However, this is a different approach. 

But maybe this is not necessary. Since we already have the induction proof for both inequalities, maybe that's sufficient. 

Alternatively, let's think about the lower bound. For the lower bound, 2^n < binomial(2n, n). 

Another approach: consider that binomial(2n, n) is equal to the number of ways to choose n elements from 2n. Alternatively, think of it as the number of subsets of size n. 

But how does that compare to 2^n? Well, 2^n is the number of subsets of size n from a set of size n. But here, we have a larger set. 

Alternatively, think of the binomial coefficient as the product of terms. Let me write binomial(2n, n) as:

(2n)(2n - 1)...(n + 1)/n! 

Let me write this as:

Product_{k=1}^n (n + k)/k 

Which is Product_{k=1}^n (1 + n/k) 

But since n/k >= 1 for k <= n, each term is at least 2 when k = n/2. Wait, but maybe not. For example, when k = 1, it's (n + 1)/1 = n + 1. For k = 2, it's (n + 2)/2. For k = n, it's (n + n)/n = 2. 

So the product is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 * ... * 2. 

But maybe I can compare this product to 2^n. Let me take the logarithm? Maybe that's too complicated. 

Alternatively, note that each term in the product (n + k)/k = 1 + n/k. So the product is the product_{k=1}^n (1 + n/k). 

But maybe compare this to 2^n. 

Alternatively, note that for k from 1 to n, n/k is at least 1 (since k <= n). So each term is at least 2. But actually, for k = 1, it's n + 1, which is greater than 2 for n >= 2. For k = 2, (n + 2)/2. For n >= 2, if n = 2, then (2 + 2)/2 = 2. For n >= 3, (n + 2)/2 > 2. Similarly, for k = 3, (n + 3)/3. For n >= 3, this is at least (3 + 3)/3 = 2. So actually, each term is at least 2. Therefore, the product is at least 2^n. 

But wait, if each term is at least 2, then the product is at least 2^n. However, the product is exactly binomial(2n, n). Therefore, binomial(2n, n) >= 2^n. But the problem states that it is strictly greater than 2^n. 

But when does equality hold? If all terms are exactly 2, then the product would be 2^n. When would (n + k)/k = 2? That would mean n + k = 2k => n = k. So when k = n, the term is (n + n)/n = 2. For other k, the term is greater than 2. For example, when k = 1, it's n + 1, which is greater than 2 for n >= 2. Similarly, for k = 2, (n + 2)/2. For n >= 2, if n = 2, then (2 + 2)/2 = 2. But for n >= 3, (n + 2)/2 > 2. Therefore, for n >= 2, the product is greater than 2^n. 

Wait, for n = 2, the product is (2 + 1)/1 * (2 + 2)/2 = 3 * 2 = 6, which is 2^2 * 1.5. So 6 > 4 = 2^2. 

For n = 3, the product is (3 + 1)/1 * (3 + 2)/2 * (3 + 3)/3 = 4 * 2.5 * 2 = 20, which is greater than 8 = 2^3. 

So in general, for n >= 2, the product is greater than 2^n. Therefore, binomial(2n, n) > 2^n. 

Therefore, this gives another proof for the lower bound. 

Therefore, combining both approaches, we have established that 2^n < binomial(2n, n) < 2^{2n} for n > 1. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the inequality between the arithmetic mean and geometric mean? 

But I think the previous methods are sufficient. 

So, to recap:

For the lower bound, we can note that binomial(2n, n) is the product of terms each greater than 2 (for n >= 2), hence the product is greater than 2^n. 

For the upper bound, we can use the fact that the sum of all binomial coefficients is 2^{2n}, and since binomial(2n, n) is one of the terms, it must be less than 2^{2n}. 

Alternatively, using induction for both inequalities. 

Therefore, the inequality holds for all n > 1. 

I think that's thorough enough. Let me check for n = 2 again. 2^2 = 4, binomial(4, 2) = 6, which is greater. 2^{4} = 16, which is greater than 6. For n = 3, 2^3 = 8, binomial(6, 3) = 20, which is greater. 2^6 = 64, which is greater. 

Therefore, the inequality holds. 

Another way to think about the lower bound is using the formula for binomial coefficients. For example, binomial(2n, n) = 2n * (2n - 1) * ... * (n + 1) / n! 

Let me write this as:

Product_{k=1}^n (n + k) / n! 

But n! = 1 * 2 * ... * n. 

Alternatively, write the product as:

(n + 1)(n + 2)...(2n) / (n! )

But (n + 1)(n + 2)...(2n) is equal to (2n)! / n! 

Therefore, binomial(2n, n) = (2n)! / (n! * n! )

But how does that help? 

Alternatively, compare (2n)! / (n! * n! ) with 2^n. 

Let me think about the ratio (2n)! / (n! * n! ) / 2^n. 

But maybe using Stirling's approximation? 

Stirling's formula says that n! ≈ n^n e^{-n} sqrt(2πn). 

So, let's approximate:

(2n)! ≈ (2n)^{2n} e^{-2n} sqrt(4πn)

n! ≈ n^n e^{-n} sqrt(2πn)

Therefore, binomial(2n, n) ≈ [ (2n)^{2n} e^{-2n} sqrt(4πn) ] / [ (n^n e^{-n} sqrt(2πn))^2 ] 

Simplify denominator: (n^{2n} e^{-2n} 2πn )

Therefore, binomial(2n, n) ≈ [ (2n)^{2n} e^{-2n} sqrt(4πn) ] / [ n^{2n} e^{-2n} 2πn ] 

Simplify:

(2^{2n} n^{2n}) / (n^{2n}) * sqrt(4πn) / (2πn) ) 

Which is 2^{2n} * sqrt(4πn) / (2πn) ) 

Simplify sqrt(4πn) = 2 sqrt(πn), so:

2^{2n} * 2 sqrt(πn) / (2πn) ) = 2^{2n} * 1 / sqrt(πn) 

Therefore, binomial(2n, n) ≈ 2^{2n} / sqrt(πn). 

Therefore, binomial(2n, n) is approximately 2^{2n} divided by sqrt(πn), which is much less than 2^{2n}, and also, since sqrt(πn) grows with n, the lower bound 2^n is much smaller than this. 

But this is an approximation. However, it shows that binomial(2n, n) is exponentially smaller than 2^{2n}, which confirms the upper bound. 

But maybe this is more advanced than needed. However, since the problem is for n > 1, and we have already proven it via induction and via product arguments, this might not be necessary. 

In conclusion, both inequalities can be proven using induction or by analyzing the product representation of the binomial coefficient. Therefore, the inequality 2^n < binomial(2n, n) < 2^{2n} holds for all integers n > 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2^n < \binom{2n}{n} < 2^{2n}}
</think>

To establish the inequality  
$$
2^n < \binom{2n}{n} < 2^{2n}
$$  
for all integers $ n > 1 $, we analyze the binomial coefficient $ \binom{2n}{n} $, which counts the number of ways to choose $ n $ elements from a set of $ 2n $ elements.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Binomial Coefficient**

The binomial coefficient is defined as:
$$
\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{n! \cdot n!}
$$

This is the central term in the binomial expansion of $ (1 + 1)^{2n} = 2^{2n} $, and it is the **largest** term in the expansion due to the symmetry and increasing nature of binomial coefficients up to the middle.

---

### **Step 2: Proving the Lower Bound $ 2^n < \binom{2n}{n} $**

We can consider the product representation of the binomial coefficient:
$$
\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)\cdots(2n)}{n!}
$$

This is the product of $ n $ terms of the form $ \frac{n+k}{k} $ for $ k = 1 $ to $ n $, or equivalently:
$$
\binom{2n}{n} = \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{n}{k}\right)
$$

For $ n \geq 2 $, each term in the product is strictly greater than 2. For example:

- When $ k = 1 $, $ \frac{n+1}{1} = n+1 > 2 $
- When $ k = n $, $ \frac{n+n}{n} = 2 $

Since all terms are strictly greater than 2, the entire product is strictly greater than $ 2^n $. Thus:
$$
\binom{2n}{n} > 2^n
$$

---

### **Step 3: Proving the Upper Bound $ \binom{2n}{n} < 2^{2n} $**

The binomial theorem tells us that:
$$
(1 + 1)^{2n} = \sum_{k=0}^{2n} \binom{2n}{k} = 2^{2n}
$$

Since the binomial coefficients are symmetric and the middle term $ \binom{2n}{n} $ is the **largest** among them, it must be **less than** the total sum $ 2^{2n} $. Therefore:
$$
\binom{2n}{n} < 2^{2n}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Final Inequality**

Combining the two results, we have:
$$
2^n < \binom{2n}{n} < 2^{2n}
$$

This holds for all integers $ n > 1 $.

---

### **Conclusion**

We have shown both bounds using elementary arguments based on the structure of binomial coefficients and the binomial theorem. Thus, the inequality is valid for all $ n > 1 $.

$$
\boxed{2^n < \binom{2n}{n} < 2^{2n}}
$$
