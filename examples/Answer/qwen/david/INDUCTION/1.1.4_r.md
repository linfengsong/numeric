Okay, so I need to prove that the cube of any integer can be written as the difference of two squares. The hint says to use the formula for the sum of cubes. Let me recall that the sum of the first n cubes is given by the formula:

$$1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + n^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2$$

Right? Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the hint is telling me that $n^3$ is equal to the difference between the sum of the first n cubes and the sum of the first (n-1) cubes. Let me write that down:

$$n^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{(n-1)n}{2}\right)^2$$

So, if I can show that this expression simplifies to $n^3$, then that would prove the statement. Let me check that.

First, let me compute the difference between the two squares:

$$\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{(n-1)n}{2}\right)^2$$

This looks like a difference of squares, which factors as $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$. Let me apply that here.

Let me denote:

$a = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

$b = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$

So, the difference is:

$$ (a - b)(a + b) $$

Compute $a - b$:

$$ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} = \frac{n[(n + 1) - (n - 1)]}{2} = \frac{n(2)}{2} = n $$

Okay, that simplifies nicely to n.

Now compute $a + b$:

$$ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} = \frac{n[(n + 1) + (n - 1)]}{2} = \frac{n(2n)}{2} = n^2 $$

So, the product is $n \times n^2 = n^3$. Therefore, the difference of the two squares is indeed $n^3$. Therefore, this shows that $n^3$ can be written as the difference of two squares.

Wait, but the problem says "the cube of any integer". So, does this work for negative integers as well? Let me check.

Suppose n is negative. Let me take n = -k where k is a positive integer. Then, let's see:

$$ (-k)^3 = -k^3 $$

But according to the formula, the difference of squares would be:

$$ \left(\frac{-k(-k + 1)}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{(-k - 1)(-k)}{2}\right)^2 $$

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the formula for negative integers. Wait, but the original formula was for the sum of cubes from 1^3 to n^3. If n is negative, then the sum from 1^3 to n^3 doesn't make sense unless we define it somehow. Maybe the hint is only for positive integers? Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says "the cube of any integer". So maybe we need to consider both positive and negative integers. But let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the formula works for negative integers as well. Let me try n = -1.

For n = -1:

Left side: (-1)^3 = -1.

Right side: [ ( (-1)(-1 + 1) / 2 )^2 - ( (-1 - 1)(-1) / 2 )^2 ]

Wait, let's compute:

First term: [ (-1)(0)/2 ]^2 = 0^2 = 0

Second term: [ (-2)(-1)/2 ]^2 = [2/2]^2 = 1^2 = 1

Therefore, difference is 0 - 1 = -1, which is equal to (-1)^3. So that works.

Similarly, let's check n = -2:

Left side: (-2)^3 = -8.

Right side:

First term: [ (-2)(-2 + 1)/2 ]^2 = [ (-2)(-1)/2 ]^2 = [2/2]^2 = 1^2 = 1

Second term: [ (-2 - 1)(-2)/2 ]^2 = [ (-3)(-2)/2 ]^2 = [6/2]^2 = 3^2 = 9

Difference: 1 - 9 = -8, which is equal to (-2)^3. So that works too.

So even for negative integers, the formula works. Therefore, this formula seems to hold for any integer n.

But let me check another case. Let me take n = 0. Then, 0^3 = 0.

According to the formula:

First term: [0*(0 + 1)/2]^2 = 0^2 = 0

Second term: [ (0 - 1)*0 / 2 ]^2 = [ (-1)*0 / 2 ]^2 = 0^2 = 0

Difference is 0 - 0 = 0, which is correct. So that works.

Therefore, regardless of whether n is positive, negative, or zero, the formula holds. Therefore, the cube of any integer can be written as the difference of two squares. Therefore, the proof is done.

But let me think again. The problem says "the cube of any integer can be written as the difference of two squares". So, in general, for any integer n, n^3 = A^2 - B^2, where A and B are integers.

But in the formula above, A is [n(n + 1)/2] and B is [n(n - 1)/2]. But for negative n, these expressions still give integers? Let me check for n = -1:

A = [ -1*( -1 + 1 ) / 2 ] = [ -1*0 / 2 ] = 0, which is integer.

B = [ -1*( -1 - 1 ) / 2 ] = [ -1*(-2)/2 ] = 2/2 = 1, which is integer.

Similarly, for n = -2:

A = [ -2*(-2 + 1)/2 ] = [ -2*(-1)/2 ] = 2/2 = 1, integer.

B = [ -2*(-2 - 1)/2 ] = [ -2*(-3)/2 ] = 6/2 = 3, integer.

So yes, for any integer n, both A and B are integers. Therefore, the difference A^2 - B^2 is indeed n^3.

Therefore, this proves that any integer cube can be written as the difference of two squares.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about this? For example, maybe for any integer n, n^3 can be expressed as (something)^2 - (something else)^2. But the hint gives a specific way using the sum of cubes. However, the above proof seems to work.

But let me check for a specific example. Let's take n = 2. Then 2^3 = 8. According to the formula, A = [2*3/2] = 3, B = [2*1/2] = 1. Then 3^2 - 1^2 = 9 - 1 = 8. Correct. For n = 3: A = [3*4/2] = 6, B = [3*2/2] = 3. 6^2 - 3^2 = 36 - 9 = 27 = 3^3. Correct.

For n = 1: A = [1*2/2] = 1, B = [1*0/2] = 0. 1^2 - 0^2 = 1 - 0 = 1 = 1^3. Correct.

For n = -1: A = 0, B = 1. 0^2 - 1^2 = -1 = (-1)^3. Correct.

So all these examples work. Therefore, the formula works.

Therefore, the proof is done by using the identity for the sum of cubes, then applying the difference of squares formula, which simplifies to n^3. Therefore, the cube of any integer is the difference of two squares.

But let me think again if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe more directly. For example, maybe express n^3 as a difference of squares without using the sum of cubes. But the hint suggests using the sum of cubes, so probably the intended way is the one above.

Alternatively, suppose we want to find integers a and b such that n^3 = a^2 - b^2. Then, we can factor this as (a - b)(a + b) = n^3. So, we need to find two integers a and b such that a - b and a + b are factors of n^3, and their product is n^3. Also, since a and b are integers, a - b and a + b must be both even or both odd. Since n^3 is an integer, depending on whether n is even or odd, but in any case, the factors a - b and a + b must have the same parity.

But since n^3 can be factored into two factors of the same parity, then we can set a - b = d and a + b = n^3 / d, where d is a divisor of n^3. Then solving for a and b:

a = (d + n^3 / d)/2

b = (n^3 / d - d)/2

Therefore, for each divisor d of n^3, we can find such a and b. However, the question is whether there exists such d for any integer n. But since n^3 is a cube, it has divisors that can be paired as such. However, this approach might be more general, but the hint suggests using the sum of cubes.

But since the problem gives the hint, I think the first approach is the way to go. Therefore, the answer is that by using the formula for the sum of cubes, we can express n^3 as the difference of two squares as shown above.

Therefore, the proof is complete.

**Final Answer**
The cube of any integer can be written as the difference of two squares, so the answer is \boxed{n^3} expressed as the difference of two squares as shown in the proof.
</think>

To prove that the cube of any integer can be written as the difference of two squares, we begin by leveraging a known identity involving the sum of cubes:

$$
1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + n^3 = \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2
$$

This identity is a well-known result in number theory, and it allows us to express the cube of any integer $ n $ as the difference between two perfect squares.

### Step 1: Use the Identity for the Difference of Cubes

The hint suggests that:

$$
n^3 = \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \right)^2
$$

This is a direct application of the identity for the sum of cubes. Specifically, the cube $ n^3 $ is the difference between the sum of the first $ n $ cubes and the sum of the first $ n-1 $ cubes.

---

### Step 2: Apply the Difference of Squares Formula

Let:

$$
a = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}, \quad b = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
$$

Then the expression becomes:

$$
n^3 = a^2 - b^2
$$

Using the identity $ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) $, we compute:

- $ a - b = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \frac{n[(n+1) - (n-1)]}{2} = \frac{n \cdot 2}{2} = n $
- $ a + b = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \frac{n[(n+1) + (n-1)]}{2} = \frac{n \cdot 2n}{2} = n^2 $

Therefore:

$$
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) = n \cdot n^2 = n^3
$$

---

### Step 3: Generalization to All Integers

We have shown that the identity holds for positive integers $ n $. Now we check for $ n = 0 $, $ n = -1 $, and $ n = -2 $:

- For $ n = 0 $: $ 0^3 = 0 = 0^2 - 0^2 $
- For $ n = -1 $: $ (-1)^3 = -1 = 0^2 - 1^2 $
- For $ n = -2 $: $ (-2)^3 = -8 = 1^2 - 3^2 $

In all these cases, the identity holds, and both $ a $ and $ b $ are integers. This confirms that the identity works for all integers, not just positive ones.

---

### Conclusion

We have shown that for any integer $ n $, the cube $ n^3 $ can be written as the difference of two perfect squares:

$$
n^3 = \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \right)^2
$$

Thus, the cube of any integer can be expressed as the difference of two squares.

$$
\boxed{n^3}
