Okay, so I need to prove that the sequence defined by a₁ = 11, a₂ = 21, and the recurrence relation aₙ = 3aₙ₋₁ - 2aₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 3 is equal to 5·2ⁿ + 1 for all n ≥ 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for linear recurrence relations, one common method is to find the characteristic equation and solve for the general solution. Maybe I can try that here. Let me recall the steps.

The recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients. The general form is aₙ - 3aₙ₋₁ + 2aₙ₋₂ = 0. To find the characteristic equation, I replace aₙ with rⁿ, so the equation becomes rⁿ - 3rⁿ⁻¹ + 2rⁿ⁻² = 0. Dividing both sides by rⁿ⁻² (assuming r ≠ 0), we get r² - 3r + 2 = 0. 

Solving this quadratic equation: r² - 3r + 2 = 0. The discriminant is 9 - 8 = 1, so the roots are [3 ± 1]/2, which gives r = (3 + 1)/2 = 2 and r = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. Therefore, the general solution of the recurrence relation is aₙ = A·2ⁿ + B·1ⁿ, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions.

So, the general solution is aₙ = A·2ⁿ + B. Now, I need to find A and B using the initial conditions.

Given a₁ = 11. Let's plug n = 1 into the general solution: a₁ = A·2¹ + B = 2A + B = 11.

Similarly, for a₂ = 21: a₂ = A·2² + B = 4A + B = 21.

Now, we have a system of equations:

1) 2A + B = 11

2) 4A + B = 21

To solve for A and B, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(4A + B) - (2A + B) = 21 - 11 ⇒ 2A = 10 ⇒ A = 5.

Substituting A = 5 into equation 1: 2*5 + B = 11 ⇒ 10 + B = 11 ⇒ B = 1.

Therefore, the general solution is aₙ = 5·2ⁿ + 1. That's exactly the formula we need to prove! So, this seems to check out.

But wait, the problem says "prove that aₙ = 5·2ⁿ + 1 for n ≥ 1". Since we used the initial conditions to find A and B, and the recurrence relation is satisfied by the general solution, then this formula should hold for all n ≥ 1. But maybe I need to verify it using mathematical induction or another method to ensure it's correct?

Let me try mathematical induction. First, check the base cases.

For n = 1: a₁ = 5·2¹ + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11. Which matches the given a₁ = 11. Good.

For n = 2: a₂ = 5·2² + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21. Which matches the given a₂ = 21. Good.

Now, assume that for some k ≥ 2, the formula holds for all integers from 1 to k. That is, aₘ = 5·2ᵐ + 1 for all m ≤ k. We need to show that a_{k+1} = 5·2^{k+1} + 1.

But according to the recurrence relation, a_{k+1} = 3a_k - 2a_{k-1}.

Using the formula for a_k and a_{k-1}:

a_{k+1} = 3*(5·2^k + 1) - 2*(5·2^{k-1} + 1)

Let me compute this:

First, expand the terms:

3*(5·2^k) + 3*1 - 2*(5·2^{k-1}) - 2*1

= 15·2^k + 3 - 10·2^{k-1} - 2

Simplify the constants: 3 - 2 = 1.

Now, let's handle the terms with 2^k:

Note that 2^{k-1} = (1/2)·2^k, so 10·2^{k-1} = 5·2^k.

Therefore, 15·2^k - 5·2^k = 10·2^k.

So, altogether, a_{k+1} = 10·2^k + 1.

But 10·2^k is equal to 5·2^{k+1} because 10 is 5·2. Therefore, 10·2^k = 5·2^{k+1}.

Therefore, a_{k+1} = 5·2^{k+1} + 1, which is exactly the formula we wanted to prove. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1.

Alternatively, since we already derived the general solution using the characteristic equation and verified the initial conditions, and since the recurrence relation is satisfied by the general solution, then the formula is valid for all n ≥ 1.

But maybe I should check another term to be sure. Let's compute a₃ using the recurrence and using the formula.

Using the recurrence: a₃ = 3a₂ - 2a₁ = 3*21 - 2*11 = 63 - 22 = 41.

Using the formula: 5·2³ + 1 = 5*8 + 1 = 40 + 1 = 41. Correct.

Similarly, a₄ using recurrence: 3a₃ - 2a₂ = 3*41 - 2*21 = 123 - 42 = 81.

Using formula: 5·2⁴ + 1 = 5*16 + 1 = 80 + 1 = 81. Correct.

So, seems like the formula works. Therefore, the proof is correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about this is to note that the recurrence relation aₙ - 3aₙ₋₁ + 2aₙ₋₂ = 0 has characteristic roots 2 and 1, so the general solution is as above. Then, with the initial conditions, we find A and B. Therefore, the formula is proven.

Alternatively, if I didn't remember the characteristic equation method, maybe I could use mathematical induction as I did above. Since the problem says "prove that", and I have two methods: solving the recurrence via characteristic equation and induction. Both methods lead to the same conclusion.

Therefore, the conclusion is that aₙ = 5·2ⁿ + 1 for all n ≥ 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{a_n = 5 \cdot 2^n + 1}
</think>

To prove that the sequence defined by the recurrence relation:

$$
a_1 = 11,\quad a_2 = 21,\quad a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2} \text{ for } n \geq 3
$$

satisfies the formula:

$$
a_n = 5 \cdot 2^n + 1 \quad \text{for } n \geq 1,
$$

we can proceed using the **method of solving linear recurrence relations** with constant coefficients.

### Step 1: Solve the Characteristic Equation

The recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is obtained by assuming a solution of the form $ a_n = r^n $, leading to:

$$
r^2 - 3r + 2 = 0
$$

Solving this quadratic equation:

$$
r = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm 1}{2} \Rightarrow r = 2 \text{ or } r = 1
$$

So, the general solution of the recurrence is:

$$
a_n = A \cdot 2^n + B \cdot 1^n = A \cdot 2^n + B
$$

---

### Step 2: Use Initial Conditions to Solve for Constants

We are given:

- $ a_1 = 11 \Rightarrow 2A + B = 11 $
- $ a_2 = 21 \Rightarrow 4A + B = 21 $

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

$$
(4A + B) - (2A + B) = 21 - 11 \Rightarrow 2A = 10 \Rightarrow A = 5
$$

Substitute $ A = 5 $ into $ 2A + B = 11 $:

$$
2(5) + B = 11 \Rightarrow 10 + B = 11 \Rightarrow B = 1
$$

Thus, the closed-form expression is:

$$
a_n = 5 \cdot 2^n + 1
$$

### Step 3: Verify the Formula Holds for All $ n \geq 1 $

We now verify that this formula satisfies the recurrence relation and initial conditions.

- **Base Cases:**

  - For $ n = 1 $: $ a_1 = 5 \cdot 2^1 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 $ ✓
  - For $ n = 2 $: $ a_2 = 5 \cdot 2^2 + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21 $ ✓

- **Inductive Step:**

Assume that for some $ k \geq 2 $, the formula holds for all $ n \leq k $, i.e.,

$$
a_n = 5 \cdot 2^n + 1 \quad \text{for all } n \leq k
$$

We now show that the formula holds for $ n = k+1 $:

Using the recurrence:

$$
a_{k+1} = 3a_k - 2a_{k-1}
$$

Substitute the formula for $ a_k $ and $ a_{k-1} $:

$$
a_{k+1} = 3(5 \cdot 2^k + 1) - 2(5 \cdot 2^{k-1} + 1)
$$

Simplify:

$$
= 15 \cdot 2^k + 3 - 10 \cdot 2^{k-1} - 2
$$

Note that $ 10 \cdot 2^{k-1} = 5 \cdot 2^k $, so:

$$
= 15 \cdot 2^k + 3 - 5 \cdot 2^k - 2 = 10 \cdot 2^k + 1 = 5 \cdot 2^{k+1} + 1
$$

Which is the desired form. Thus, the formula holds for $ n = k+1 $.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the formula is valid for all $ n \geq 1 $.

\boxed{a_n = 5 \cdot 2^n + 1}
