Okay, so I need to show that the binomial coefficient $\binom{2n}{n}$ is equal to $\frac{1·3·5···(2n-1)}{2·4·6···2n} \times 2^{2n}$. Let me start by recalling what the binomial coefficient is. The formula for $\binom{2n}{n}$ is $\frac{(2n)!}{n! \cdot n!}$. So maybe I can start by expressing both sides in terms of factorials and see if they are equal.

First, let me write down the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation given. The RHS is $\frac{1·3·5···(2n-1)}{2·4·6···2n} \times 2^{2n}$. Let me try to simplify this expression.

The numerator of the fraction is the product of the first n odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n-1). The denominator is the product of the first n even numbers: 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n. Let me write these products in terms of factorials or other known expressions.

First, the numerator: 1·3·5·...·(2n-1). I remember that the product of the first n odd numbers can be related to double factorials. The double factorial of an odd number (2n-1)!! is the product of all the odd numbers from 1 up to (2n-1). So, the numerator is (2n-1)!!.

Similarly, the denominator is 2·4·6·...·2n. This is the product of the first n even numbers. The product of the first n even numbers is 2^n · n! because each term is 2 times the corresponding integer. So, 2·4·6·...·2n = 2^n · n!.

Therefore, the fraction $\frac{(2n-1)!!}{2^n \cdot n!}$ multiplied by $2^{2n}$ gives:

$$
\frac{(2n-1)!!}{2^n \cdot n!} \times 2^{2n} = \frac{(2n-1)!!}{n!} \times 2^n
$$

So, the RHS simplifies to $\frac{(2n-1)!! \times 2^n}{n!}$. Now, I need to relate this to the binomial coefficient $\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}$.

So, if I can show that $\frac{(2n-1)!! \times 2^n}{n!} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}$, then the equality holds.

Alternatively, maybe I can express (2n)! in terms of (2n-1)!! and something else. Let me recall that (2n)! = (2n)(2n-1)(2n-2)...(2)(1). If I separate the even and odd terms, (2n)! = [2n · 2(n-1) · 2(n-2) · ... · 2·1] · [ (2n-1) · (2n-3) · ... · 1 ]? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

Actually, (2n)! can be written as the product of even numbers and the product of odd numbers. The even numbers are 2, 4, ..., 2n, which is 2^n · n! as before. The odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n-1), which is (2n-1)!!. Therefore:

$$
(2n)! = (2^n \cdot n!) \times (2n - 1)!!
$$

Therefore, substituting back into the binomial coefficient:

$$
\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2} = \frac{2^n \cdot n! \cdot (2n - 1)!!}{(n!)^2} = \frac{2^n \cdot (2n - 1)!!}{n!}
$$

Which is exactly the expression we had for the RHS. Therefore, this shows that:

$$
\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n - 1)!! \cdot 2^n}{n!} = \frac{1·3·5···(2n-1)}{2·4·6···2n} \cdot 2^{2n}
$$

Wait, hold on. Wait, in the previous steps, I had that the RHS simplifies to $\frac{(2n-1)!! \cdot 2^n}{n!}$, but the original RHS given in the problem is $\frac{1·3·5···(2n-1)}{2·4·6···2n} \times 2^{2n}$. Let me check if these are equal.

We had that $\frac{(2n-1)!!}{2^n \cdot n!} \times 2^{2n} = \frac{(2n-1)!! \cdot 2^{2n}}{2^n \cdot n!} = \frac{(2n-1)!! \cdot 2^n}{n!}$, which is the same as the expression we derived for the binomial coefficient. Therefore, yes, they are equal.

Therefore, the given equation holds. Therefore, we have shown that $\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{1·3·5···(2n-1)}{2·4·6···2n} \times 2^{2n}$.

But let me check with a small value of n to make sure. Let me take n=1. Then:

Left-hand side (LHS): $\binom{2}{1} = 2$.

Right-hand side (RHS): $\frac{1}{2} \times 2^{2} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2$. Okay, that works.

Another test: n=2.

LHS: $\binom{4}{2} = 6$.

RHS: $\frac{1·3}{2·4} \times 2^4 = \frac{3}{8} \times 16 = 6$. Correct.

Another test: n=3.

LHS: $\binom{6}{3} = 20$.

RHS: $\frac{1·3·5}{2·4·6} \times 2^6 = \frac{15}{48} \times 64 = \frac{15}{48} \times 64 = 15 × (64/48) = 15 × (4/3) = 20. Correct.

So, seems like the formula works. Therefore, the equality holds.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Let me think.

Alternatively, the RHS can be written as:

$$
\frac{\prod_{k=1}^n (2k - 1)}{\prod_{k=1}^n 2k} \times 2^{2n} = \prod_{k=1}^n \frac{2k - 1}{2k} \times 2^{2n}
$$

Which is equal to:

$$
\prod_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{2k - 1}{2k} \times 2^2 \right ) = \prod_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{2k - 1}{2k} \times 4 \right )
$$

Wait, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe we can think of the product $\prod_{k=1}^n \frac{2k - 1}{2k}$ as $\frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n} (n!)^2}$. Wait, let me check.

Wait, earlier we had that (2n)! = 2^n n! (2n - 1)!!. Therefore, (2n - 1)!! = (2n)! / (2^n n!). Therefore, the product $\prod_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) = (2n - 1)!! = \frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}$. Therefore, the numerator of the fraction in RHS is (2n - 1)!!, denominator is 2^n n!.

Therefore, the fraction is $\frac{(2n - 1)!!}{2^n n!}$, multiplied by 2^{2n} gives $\frac{(2n - 1)!!}{n!} \times 2^n$, which is same as before. Which equals $\frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}$. Therefore, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the RHS as:

$$
\frac{1·3·5···(2n-1)}{2·4·6···2n} \times 2^{2n} = \frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n} (n!)^2} \times 2^{2n} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2} = \binom{2n}{n}
$$

Wait, hold on, that seems too straightforward. Wait, how?

Wait, if I consider that:

The product of the first n odd numbers is (2n)! / (2^n n!). Therefore, the numerator is (2n)! / (2^n n!). The denominator is 2^n n!.

Therefore, the fraction is [ (2n)! / (2^n n!) ] / [ 2^n n! ] = (2n)! / (2^{2n} (n!)^2). Then multiplying by 2^{2n} gives (2n)! / (n!)^2, which is the binomial coefficient. Therefore, that's another way to see it.

Therefore, that's a more straightforward way. Therefore, that shows that the RHS is equal to the LHS.

So, that seems to confirm the equality.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the product 1·3·5...·(2n-1) as the numerator and 2·4·6...·2n as the denominator, and then multiplying by 2^{2n}.

Alternatively, think of each term in the product as (2k - 1)/2k, then multiply by 2^{2n}.

But regardless, the key idea is that the product of the odd numbers over the product of the even numbers is equal to (2n)! / (2^{2n} (n!)^2), and multiplying by 2^{2n} gives the binomial coefficient.

Therefore, this shows that the equality holds.

So, in conclusion, by expressing the product of odd numbers and even numbers in terms of factorials, and then simplifying, we can show that the given equation is true for all n ≥ 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{1·3·5···(2n-1)}{2·4·6···2n} \cdot 2^{2n}}
</think>

To show that for $ n \geq 1 $,
$$
\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdots (2n - 1)}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdots 2n} \cdot 2^{2n},
$$
we begin by analyzing both sides of the equation and comparing them.

### Step 1: Express the Binomial Coefficient

We know the standard formula for the binomial coefficient:
$$
\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}.
$$

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Right-Hand Side

The right-hand side is:
$$
\frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdots (2n - 1)}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdots 2n} \cdot 2^{2n}.
$$

Let’s denote the numerator and denominator of the fraction:

- **Numerator:** $ 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdots (2n - 1) $, which is the product of the first $ n $ odd numbers. This is known as the **double factorial**:
  $$
  (2n - 1)!! = 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdots (2n - 1).
  $$

- **Denominator:** $ 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdots 2n $, which is the product of the first $ n $ even numbers. This can be rewritten as:
  $$
  2^n \cdot n!.
  $$

So the fraction becomes:
$$
\frac{(2n - 1)!!}{2^n \cdot n!}.
$$

Now, multiply this by $ 2^{2n} $:
$$
\frac{(2n - 1)!!}{2^n \cdot n!} \cdot 2^{2n} = \frac{(2n - 1)!! \cdot 2^n}{n!}.
$$

---

### Step 3: Express the Factorial in Terms of the Double Factorial

We use the identity:
$$
(2n)! = (2^n \cdot n!) \cdot (2n - 1)!!.
$$

This allows us to write:
$$
(2n - 1)!! = \frac{(2n)!}{2^n \cdot n!}.
$$

Substituting this into our expression for the RHS:
$$
\frac{(2n - 1)!! \cdot 2^n}{n!} = \frac{\frac{(2n)!}{2^n \cdot n!} \cdot 2^n}{n!} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}.
$$

Thus, the right-hand side simplifies to:
$$
\frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2} = \binom{2n}{n}.
$$

---

### Step 4: Conclusion

We have shown that both sides of the equation are equal:
$$
\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdots (2n - 1)}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdots 2n} \cdot 2^{2n}.
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdots (2n - 1)}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdots 2n} \cdot 2^{2n}}
$$
