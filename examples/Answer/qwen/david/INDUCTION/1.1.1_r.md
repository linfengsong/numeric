Okay, so I need to prove these five formulas using mathematical induction. Let me start with part (a) because that's the classic one I remember from school. The formula is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 for all n ≥ 1. 

First, I remember that mathematical induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. For the base case, I need to check if the formula holds when n is 1. Let me plug in n = 1. The left side is just 1, and the right side is 1*(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Okay, that works. So the base case is verified.

Now, the inductive step. I need to assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary positive integer k, which is the inductive hypothesis. So, assuming that 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Then, I need to show that the formula holds for k + 1. That is, I need to prove that 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k + 1) = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2.

Let me write that out. Starting with the left side: the sum up to k plus (k + 1). According to the inductive hypothesis, the sum up to k is k(k + 1)/2. So adding (k + 1) to that gives k(k + 1)/2 + (k + 1). Let me factor out (k + 1):

(k + 1)[k/2 + 1] = (k + 1)[(k + 2)/2] = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2. Which is exactly the right side for n = k + 1. Therefore, the formula holds for k + 1 if it holds for k. Hence, by induction, the formula is true for all n ≥ 1. 

Okay, that seems straightforward. Let me move on to part (b): 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n² for all n ≥ 1. 

Again, base case: n = 1. Left side is 1, right side is 1² = 1. Checks out.

Inductive step: Assume that for some k ≥ 1, the sum 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k². Need to show that for k + 1, the sum is (k + 1)². 

So the sum up to k + 1 would be the sum up to k plus the next term, which is 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 1. Therefore, the left side is k² + (2k + 1). Let me compute that: k² + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)². Which is exactly the right side. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1. 

Hmm, that seems simple too. Maybe I should check with n = 2. For n = 2, the sum is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2². Yep, works. For n = 3, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3². Correct. So that seems okay.

Moving on to part (c): 1·2 + 2·3 + 3·4 + ... + n(n + 1) = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/3 for all n ≥ 1.

Base case: n = 1. Left side is 1·2 = 2. Right side is 1·2·3 / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2. Correct.

Inductive step: Assume that for some k ≥ 1, the sum 1·2 + 2·3 + ... + k(k + 1) = k(k + 1)(k + 2)/3. Need to show that adding the next term, which is (k + 1)(k + 2), gives the formula for k + 1.

So the left side for k + 1 is the previous sum plus (k + 1)(k + 2). So:

k(k + 1)(k + 2)/3 + (k + 1)(k + 2). Let me factor out (k + 1)(k + 2):

(k + 1)(k + 2)[k/3 + 1] = (k + 1)(k + 2)[(k + 3)/3] = (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3)/3.

Which is exactly the formula for n = k + 1. Therefore, the inductive step holds. Hence, the formula is true for all n ≥ 1. 

Wait, let me check with n = 2. For n = 2, left side is 1·2 + 2·3 = 2 + 6 = 8. Right side is 2·3·4 / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8. Correct. For n = 3: 1·2 + 2·3 + 3·4 = 2 + 6 + 12 = 20. Formula: 3·4·5 / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20. Correct. Okay, that seems to work.

Part (d): 1² + 3² + 5² + ... + (2n - 1)² = n(2n - 1)(2n + 1)/3 for all n ≥ 1.

Base case: n = 1. Left side is 1² = 1. Right side: 1*(2*1 - 1)*(2*1 + 1)/3 = 1*1*3 / 3 = 1. Correct.

Inductive step: Assume that for some k ≥ 1, the sum 1² + 3² + ... + (2k - 1)² = k(2k - 1)(2k + 1)/3. Need to show that for k + 1, the sum is (k + 1)(2(k + 1) - 1)(2(k + 1) + 1)/3 = (k + 1)(2k + 1)(2k + 3)/3.

So the left side for k + 1 is the previous sum plus the next term, which is (2(k + 1) - 1)² = (2k + 1)². Therefore, the left side is:

k(2k - 1)(2k + 1)/3 + (2k + 1)².

Let me factor out (2k + 1):

(2k + 1)[k(2k - 1)/3 + (2k + 1)].

Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

First term: k(2k - 1)/3

Second term: (2k + 1) = 3(2k + 1)/3

So adding them:

[k(2k - 1) + 3(2k + 1)] / 3

Let me compute the numerator:

k(2k - 1) + 3(2k + 1) = 2k² - k + 6k + 3 = 2k² + 5k + 3.

Factor this quadratic: 2k² + 5k + 3. Let me check if it factors. The discriminant is 25 - 24 = 1. So roots are [-5 ± 1]/4. So (-5 + 1)/4 = -1, (-5 -1)/4 = -3/2. Therefore, factors are (2k + 3)(k + 1). Let me check: (2k + 3)(k + 1) = 2k² + 2k + 3k + 3 = 2k² + 5k + 3. Correct.

So the numerator is (2k + 3)(k + 1). Therefore, the entire expression becomes:

(2k + 1) * [ (2k + 3)(k + 1) / 3 ] = (2k + 1)(k + 1)(2k + 3)/3, which is exactly the formula for n = k + 1. Hence, the inductive step holds. 

Let me check with n = 2. For n = 2, left side is 1² + 3² = 1 + 9 = 10. Right side: 2*(3)*(5)/3 = 30/3 = 10. Correct. For n = 3: 1 + 9 + 25 = 35. Formula: 3*(5)*(7)/3 = 35. Correct. So that works.

Now part (e): 1³ + 2³ + 3³ + ... + n³ = [n(n + 1)/2]² for all n ≥ 1.

Base case: n = 1. Left side is 1³ = 1. Right side: [1*2/2]² = [1]² = 1. Correct.

Inductive step: Assume that for some k ≥ 1, the sum 1³ + 2³ + ... + k³ = [k(k + 1)/2]². Need to show that for k + 1, the sum is [(k + 1)(k + 2)/2]².

So the left side for k + 1 is the previous sum plus (k + 1)³. Therefore:

[k(k + 1)/2]² + (k + 1)³.

Let me compute this expression. First, expand [k(k + 1)/2]²:

= [k²(k + 1)²]/4.

Then add (k + 1)³:

= [k²(k + 1)²]/4 + (k + 1)³.

Factor out (k + 1)²:

(k + 1)² [k²/4 + (k + 1)].

Compute the term in brackets:

k²/4 + k + 1 = (k² + 4k + 4)/4 = (k + 2)² / 4.

Therefore, the entire expression becomes:

(k + 1)² * (k + 2)² / 4 = [(k + 1)(k + 2)/2]².

Which is exactly the formula for n = k + 1. Hence, the inductive step holds. Therefore, by induction, the formula is true for all n ≥ 1.

Let me check with n = 2. Left side: 1 + 8 = 9. Right side: [2*3/2]^2 = [3]^2 = 9. Correct. For n = 3: 1 + 8 + 27 = 36. Formula: [3*4/2]^2 = [6]^2 = 36. Correct. For n = 4: 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100. Formula: [4*5/2]^2 = [10]^2 = 100. Correct. So that works.

So all parts (a) through (e) have been proven by mathematical induction. Each one followed the standard steps: base case check, inductive hypothesis, and then showing that the formula holds for k + 1 based on the assumption for k. 

I think that covers all the parts. Let me just recap each part to make sure I didn't skip anything.

For (a), the sum of first n integers. (b) sum of first n odd numbers. (c) sum of k(k+1) from 1 to n. (d) sum of squares of first n odd numbers. (e) sum of cubes of first n integers. All of them were handled with induction, and each step checked out. The key was to express the inductive step correctly, often factoring or manipulating the expressions to show the desired result. 

I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the examples I checked worked. So I think these proofs are correct.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}  
(b) \boxed{n^2}  
(c) \boxed{\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{3}}  
(d) \boxed{\frac{n(2n-1)(2n+1)}{3}}  
(e) \boxed{\left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2}
