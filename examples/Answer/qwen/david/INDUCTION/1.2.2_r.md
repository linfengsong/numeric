Okay, so I need to show that the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ is equal to the sum of three other binomial coefficients: $\binom{n-2}{k-2}$, $2\binom{n-2}{k-1}$, and $\binom{n-2}{k}$, given that $2 \leq k \leq n - 2$ and $n \geq 4$. 

First, I remember that binomial coefficients have some identities, like the Pascal's identity, which states that $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}$. Maybe I can use something similar here? But the problem here involves $\binom{n-2}{...}$ terms, so maybe I need to apply Pascal's identity twice or something?

Let me write down the equation I need to prove:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-2}{k-2} + 2\binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k}
$$

Hmm. Let me think about how to relate $\binom{n}{k}$ to binomial coefficients of $n-2$. Maybe I can use Pascal's identity on $\binom{n}{k}$ by breaking it down into terms involving $n-1$ and then again into $n-2$?

Alternatively, maybe I can think combinatorially. What does $\binom{n}{k}$ count? It counts the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements. How can I relate that to choosing $k$ elements from a set of $n-2$ elements?

Wait, the right-hand side has terms with $\binom{n-2}{k-2}$, $\binom{n-2}{k-1}$, and $\binom{n-2}{k}$. Maybe there's a way to think about selecting $k$ elements from $n$ elements by considering some constraints?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for $\binom{n}{k}$ in terms of $\binom{n-1}{k}$ and $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$, and then apply the same identity again to those terms?

Let me try that approach. Let's start with the left-hand side:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k} + \binom{n-1}{k-1}
$$

Now, apply Pascal's identity again to each of these terms:

For $\binom{n-1}{k}$:

$$
\binom{n-1}{k} = \binom{n-2}{k} + \binom{n-2}{k-1}
$$

For $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$:

$$
\binom{n-1}{k-1} = \binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k-2}
$$

So substituting back into the original expression:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = [\binom{n-2}{k} + \binom{n-2}{k-1}] + [\binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k-2}]
$$

Now, combining like terms:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-2}{k-2} + 2\binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k}
$$

Which is exactly the right-hand side of the equation we needed to prove! So that seems to work.

Wait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Let me write it step by step again.

Starting with $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k} + \binom{n-1}{k-1}$.

Then, $\binom{n-1}{k} = \binom{n-2}{k} + \binom{n-2}{k-1}$.

Similarly, $\binom{n-1}{k-1} = \binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k-2}$.

Adding those two results:

$\binom{n-2}{k} + \binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k-2}$

Which is $\binom{n-2}{k-2} + 2\binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k}$.

Yes, that looks correct. Therefore, the identity holds.

But maybe I should verify with a specific example to make sure.

Let me take n=4 and k=2. Then:

Left-hand side: $\binom{4}{2} = 6$.

Right-hand side: $\binom{2}{0} + 2\binom{2}{1} + \binom{2}{2} = 1 + 2*2 + 1 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Correct.

Another example: n=5, k=2.

Left-hand side: $\binom{5}{2} = 10$.

Right-hand side: $\binom{3}{0} + 2\binom{3}{1} + \binom{3}{2} = 1 + 2*3 + 3 = 1 + 6 + 3 = 10. Correct.

Another one: n=5, k=3.

Left-hand side: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$.

Right-hand side: $\binom{3}{1} + 2\binom{3}{2} + \binom{3}{3} = 3 + 2*3 + 1 = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10. Correct.

Another test case: n=6, k=3.

Left-hand side: $\binom{6}{3} = 20$.

Right-hand side: $\binom{4}{1} + 2\binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 2*6 + 4 = 4 + 12 + 4 = 20. Correct.

Okay, seems like the identity holds for these examples. Therefore, the algebraic derivation is correct. Therefore, the identity is proven.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is using generating functions or combinatorial arguments.

But since the algebraic approach worked and the examples check out, I think that's sufficient.

Therefore, the answer is that the identity holds by applying Pascal's identity twice and combining the terms, which is shown step by step above.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-2}{k-2} + 2\binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k}}
</think>

To prove the identity

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-2}{k-2} + 2\binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k}
$$

for $2 \leq k \leq n - 2$ and $n \geq 4$, we can use **Pascal's Identity**, which states:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k} + \binom{n-1}{k-1}
$$

### Step 1: Apply Pascal's Identity to $\binom{n}{k}$

We start by applying Pascal's identity to the left-hand side:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k} + \binom{n-1}{k-1}
$$

---

### Step 2: Apply Pascal's Identity Again to Each Term

Now apply Pascal's identity to each of the two terms on the right-hand side:

- For $\binom{n-1}{k}$:

$$
\binom{n-1}{k} = \binom{n-2}{k} + \binom{n-2}{k-1}
$$

- For $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$:

$$
\binom{n-1}{k-1} = \binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k-2}
$$

---

### Step 3: Substitute Back Into the Original Expression

Now substitute these results into the original expression:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \left( \binom{n-2}{k} + \binom{n-2}{k-1} \right) + \left( \binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k-2} \right)
$$

---

### Step 4: Combine Like Terms

Group and combine the terms:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-2}{k-2} + 2\binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k}
$$

This is exactly the right-hand side of the identity we wanted to prove.

---

### Conclusion

The identity holds due to the recursive nature of binomial coefficients and the application of Pascal's Identity. The algebraic derivation is consistent and verified by multiple examples for specific values of $n$ and $k$, confirming the correctness of the result.

**Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-2}{k-2} + 2\binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k}}
$$
