Okay, so I need to solve part (a) and (b) of this problem. Let me start with part (a). The question is asking for values of n ≤ 7 where n! + 1 is a perfect square. Hmm, interesting. I remember that factorials grow really quickly, so maybe there aren't too many numbers where this is true. Let me check each n from 1 up to 7 one by one.

First, let me recall what a perfect square is. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. So, for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc., are perfect squares. So, I need to compute n! + 1 for n from 1 to 7 and see which of those results are perfect squares.

Starting with n = 1:

1! = 1. Then 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Is 2 a perfect square? Well, 1² is 1 and 2² is 4, so no. So 2 is not a perfect square. So n=1 is out.

Next, n = 2:

2! = 2. Then 2! + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3. Again, 3 is not a perfect square. 1²=1, 2²=4, so nope. Not a square.

n = 3:

3! = 6. 6 + 1 = 7. Still not a perfect square. 2²=4, 3²=9. 7 is between them, so no.

n = 4:

4! = 24. 24 + 1 = 25. Wait, 25 is 5 squared. So 5² = 25. So that works! So n=4 is a solution. Got one.

n = 5:

5! = 120. 120 + 1 = 121. Hmm, 121 is 11 squared. Because 10² is 100, 11² is 121. So yes, that's a perfect square. So n=5 is another solution.

n = 6:

6! = 720. 720 + 1 = 721. Is 721 a perfect square? Let me check. Let's see, 26² is 676, 27² is 729. So 721 is between 26² and 27². Therefore, it's not a perfect square. So n=6 is out.

n = 7:

7! = 5040. 5040 + 1 = 5041. Hmm, is 5041 a perfect square? Let me think. I remember that 71² is 5041. Wait, 70² is 4900, 71² is 4900 + 140 + 1 = 5041. Yes! So 71 squared is 5041. Therefore, n=7 is also a solution.

So for n=4, 5, 7, n! + 1 is a perfect square. Wait, but the question says "values of n ≤ 7". So n=4, 5, 7. But wait, let me check again for n=1 to 7. Did I miss anything?

Wait, n=0? The problem says n ≤ 7, but does n start from 1? Because 0! is 1, so 0! +1 = 2, which is not a square. But maybe the problem is considering positive integers? The problem says "for positive integers m and n" in part (b), but part (a) doesn't specify. However, n! is defined for non-negative integers, but maybe the question is considering n ≥ 1. But even if n=0 is allowed, 0! +1 is 2, which isn't a square. So n=4,5,7 are the ones.

But wait, let me check again for n=4, 5, 7. Wait, n=4: 24 +1=25=5², correct. n=5: 120 +1=121=11², correct. n=7: 5040 +1=5041=71², correct. So those three.

But wait, is there another one? Let me check n=3 again. 6 +1=7, not square. n=2: 3, not square. n=1: 2, not square. n=6: 721, not square. So yes, only 4,5,7. Wait, but I remember something about Brocard's problem, which is about finding integer solutions to n! + 1 = m². And it's known that the only solutions are n=4,5,7. So that seems to confirm that. So the answer for part (a) is n=4,5,7.

But the problem says "values of n ≤7", so n=4,5,7. So that's part (a). Let me check again if I made any mistake here.

Wait, maybe n=0? But if n=0, then 0! +1 is 1 +1=2, which is not square. So no. So yes, only 4,5,7. Therefore, part (a) answer is 4,5,7.

Now moving to part (b): True or false? For positive integers m and n, (mn)! = m!n! and (m + n)! = m! + n!.

So, we need to check if these two equations hold for all positive integers m and n. The question is whether they are true or false. So, the answer is probably false for both, but let me check.

First, let's check the first equation: (mn)! = m!n!.

Is this true? Let me take some small numbers. Let me take m=2, n=2. Then (2*2)! = 4! = 24. On the other hand, m!n! = 2!2! = 2*2=4. 24 ≠ 4. So clearly false. Therefore, the first equation is false. So the first part is false.

But maybe there are some cases where it's true? For example, if m=1, n=1: (1*1)! = 1! = 1, and 1!1! = 1*1=1. So that works. Similarly, m=1, n=2: (1*2)! = 2! = 2, and 1!2! = 1*2=2. So that works. Similarly, m=2, n=1: same as above. But for m=2, n=2, it's 24 vs 4. So not equal. Therefore, the equation (mn)! = m!n! is not true in general. Therefore, the statement is false.

Now the second equation: (m + n)! = m! + n!.

Again, check with some numbers. Let's take m=1, n=1: (1+1)! = 2! = 2. m! + n! = 1! + 1! = 1 + 1 = 2. So that works. Hmm. How about m=2, n=1: (2+1)! = 3! = 6. m! + n! = 2! + 1! = 2 + 1 = 3. 6 ≠ 3. So that's false. Therefore, the equation is not true in general. So the second part is also false.

But wait, maybe there are some cases where it's true? For example, m=1, n=2: (1+2)! = 6, 1! + 2! = 1 + 2 = 3. Not equal. m=1, n=3: 4! = 24, 1! + 3! = 1 + 6 = 7. Not equal. So even for m=1 and n=3, it's not equal. So the equation is false in general.

Therefore, both statements are false. Therefore, the answer for part (b) is false for both equations. However, the question says "True or false? For positive integers m and n, (mn)! = m!n! and (m + n)! = m! + n!."

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Is the question saying that both equations are true? Or is it saying that for all positive integers m and n, both equations hold? Since the way it's phrased is "For positive integers m and n, (mn)! = m!n! and (m + n)! = m! + n!".

So the question is asking whether both equations are true for all positive integers m and n. Since we found counterexamples for both, the answer is false. So both statements are false. Therefore, the answer is false.

But let me check again. Maybe there's a case where they are true? For example, m=0? But the problem says positive integers, so m and n are at least 1. So m=1, n=1: (1+1)! = 2! = 2, and 1! + 1! = 2. So that works. But for m=1, n=2: 3! = 6 vs 1! + 2! = 3. Not equal. So the second equation is not true in general. Similarly, the first equation is not true in general. So the answer is false.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking whether each of the equations is true? But the way it's phrased is "True or false? For positive integers m and n, (mn)! = m!n! and (m + n)! = m! + n!".

So the entire statement is that both equations hold for all positive integers m and n. Since both are false, the answer is false.

Therefore, part (b) is false.

So summarizing:

(a) The values of n ≤7 are 4, 5, 7.

(b) Both equations are false.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{4}, \boxed{5}, and \boxed{7}

(b) \boxed{False}

To solve the given problem, we analyze both parts step by step.

### **Part (a)**

We are asked to find all values of $ n \leq 7 $ such that $ n! + 1 $ is a **perfect square**.

A **perfect square** is an integer that can be expressed as $ k^2 $ for some integer $ k $.

We compute $ n! + 1 $ for $ n = 1 $ to $ 7 $:

- $ 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 $ → Not a perfect square.
- $ 2! + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 $ → Not a perfect square.
- $ 3! + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 $ → Not a perfect square.
- $ 4! + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 = 5^2 $ → **Perfect square**.
- $ 5! + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 = 11^2 $ → **Perfect square**.
- $ 6! + 1 = 720 + 1 = 721 $ → Not a perfect square.
- $ 7! + 1 = 5040 + 1 = 5041 = 71^2 $ → **Perfect square**.

Thus, the values of $ n \leq 7 $ for which $ n! + 1 $ is a perfect square are:

$$
\boxed{4}, \boxed{5}, \boxed{7}
$$

### **Part (b)**

We are asked to determine whether the following two statements are **true or false** for all positive integers $ m $ and $ n $:

1. $ (mn)! = m!n! $
2. $ (m + n)! = m! + n! $

#### **First Statement: $ (mn)! = m!n! $**

This is **false** in general.

- Counterexample: Let $ m = 2 $, $ n = 2 $
  - $ (mn)! = 4! = 24 $
  - $ m!n! = 2! \cdot 2! = 2 \cdot 2 = 4 $
  - $ 24 \neq 4 $

Hence, the first statement is **false**.

#### **Second Statement: $ (m + n)! = m! + n! $**

This is also **false** in general.

- Counterexample: Let $ m = 2 $, $ n = 1 $
  - $ (m + n)! = 3! = 6 $
  - $ m! + n! = 2! + 1! = 2 + 1 = 3 $
  - $ 6 \neq 3 $

Hence, the second statement is **false**.

Since both equations do **not** hold for all positive integers $ m $ and $ n $, the entire statement is **false**.

---

### **Final Answers**

(a) The values of $ n \leq 7 $ for which $ n! + 1 $ is a perfect square are:

$$
\boxed{4}, \boxed{5}, \boxed{7}
$$

(b) The statements are **false** for all positive integers $ m $ and $ n $:

$$
\boxed{False}
