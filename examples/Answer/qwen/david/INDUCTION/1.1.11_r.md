Okay, so I need to show that the expression (2n)! divided by (2^n times n!) is an integer for all non-negative integers n. Hmm, let me think. First, let me recall what factorial means. The factorial of a number k, denoted k!, is the product of all positive integers up to k. So, (2n)! is the product of numbers from 1 to 2n. The denominator is 2^n multiplied by n!. 

Let me write down the expression again to make sure I have it right: (2n)! / (2^n * n!). I need to prove that this is an integer for any n ≥ 0. Let me start with small values of n to see if I can spot a pattern or understand why it might be an integer.

For n = 0: (0)! / (2^0 * 0!) = 1 / (1 * 1) = 1, which is an integer. Okay, that works.

For n = 1: (2)! / (2^1 * 1!) = 2 / (2 * 1) = 1, which is an integer.

For n = 2: (4)! / (2^2 * 2!) = 24 / (4 * 2) = 24 / 8 = 3, which is an integer.

For n = 3: (6)! / (2^3 * 3!) = 720 / (8 * 6) = 720 / 48 = 15, which is an integer.

n = 4: 8! / (16 * 24) = 40320 / 384 = 105. Hmm, 105 is an integer. 

Okay, so for these small n, it works. But how do I prove it for all n? Maybe I can use induction? Or perhaps there's a combinatorial interpretation?

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the expression as a product and see if each term in the denominator divides the numerator. Let me try to write out (2n)! as the product of numbers from 1 to 2n. Then divide by 2^n * n!.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of (2n)! / n! as the product of (n+1)(n+2)...(2n). Then divide by 2^n. So, the expression is [ (n+1)(n+2)...(2n) ] / 2^n. So, if I can show that this product divided by 2^n is an integer, that would be good.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the central binomial coefficient? Wait, the central binomial coefficient is (2n choose n) = (2n)! / (n!)^2. But our expression is (2n)! / (2^n n!) which is equal to (2n)! / (n! 2^n) = [ (2n)! / (n!)^2 ] * n! / 2^n = (central binomial coefficient) * n! / 2^n. Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.

But maybe there's a known formula or property about the central binomial coefficient? I know that the central binomial coefficient is an integer, but here we have an extra factor of n! / 2^n. Wait, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this to something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the expression as the product of (2n)! divided by 2^n n!.

Alternatively, think of the expression as the product from k=1 to n of (n + k)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me write (2n)! / (n! 2^n). Let me think of (2n)! as (n+1)(n+2)...(2n) * n! So, (2n)! = [product from k=1 to n of (n + k)] * n! Therefore, (2n)! / (n! 2^n) = [product from k=1 to n of (n + k)] / 2^n.

So, that's the same as product from k=1 to n of (n + k)/2. So, if I can show that each term (n + k)/2 is an integer or that the product is an integer. But n + k is from n+1 to 2n. So, for each term, (n + k)/2. Let me check for n=2, k=1: (2 + 1)/2 = 3/2, which is not integer. But when we take the product over k=1 to n, maybe the denominators cancel out with numerators?

Wait, for n=2: product is (3/2)*(4/2) = (3/2)*(2) = 3, which is integer. For n=3: (4/2)*(5/2)*(6/2) = 2 * 2.5 * 3 = 15. Which is integer. For n=4: (5/2)*(6/2)*(7/2)*(8/2) = (5/2)*(3)*(7/2)*(4) = (5*3*7*4)/4 = (5*3*7) = 105. Which is integer. So, even though individual terms may not be integers, the product ends up being integer.

So, how can I show that the product of (n + k)/2 for k=1 to n is integer? Maybe by pairing terms or something else?

Alternatively, think of the product as (n+1)(n+2)...(2n)/2^n. Let me note that (n+1)(n+2)...(2n) is equal to (2n)! / n!.

So, the original expression is (2n)! / (n! 2^n). So, another way to think is that (2n)! / n! is equal to the product from k=1 to n of (n + k). So, the question is whether this product divided by 2^n is integer.

Alternatively, think about the product (n+1)(n+2)...(2n). Let me note that this product is equal to the double factorial? Not sure. Alternatively, think about the number of ways to choose something?

Alternatively, think about the expression as the number of ways to arrange things divided by something?

Alternatively, maybe use induction. Let me try that. Let me assume that for some n ≥ 0, (2n)! / (2^n n!) is integer, and then try to show that for n+1, (2(n+1))! / (2^{n+1} (n+1)!) is integer.

But how to relate the two? Let me compute (2(n+1))! = (2n + 2)! = (2n + 2)(2n + 1)(2n)!.

So, (2n + 2)! / (2^{n+1} (n+1)!) = [ (2n + 2)(2n + 1)(2n)! ] / [ 2^{n+1} (n+1)! ].

Simplify this expression: Let me write 2n + 2 as 2(n + 1). Therefore, the numerator becomes 2(n + 1)(2n + 1)(2n)!.

Denominator is 2^{n+1} (n + 1)! = 2 * 2^n * (n + 1) * n!.

Therefore, the expression becomes [2(n + 1)(2n + 1)(2n)! ] / [2 * 2^n (n + 1) n! ] = [ (2n + 1)(2n)! ] / [2^n n! ].

But that is equal to (2n + 1) * [ (2n)! / (2^n n! ) ].

By the induction hypothesis, [ (2n)! / (2^n n! ) ] is an integer. Therefore, multiplying by (2n + 1), which is an integer, gives an integer. Therefore, the expression for n + 1 is integer. Therefore, by induction, since the base case n = 0 holds, the expression is integer for all n ≥ 0. 

Wait, that seems to work. But let me check with n=1. For n=1, the expression is 2! / (2^1 1!) = 2 / 2 = 1. Then for n=2, it's 4! / (2^2 2!) = 24 / 8 = 3. Then according to the induction step, if we have for n=1, the expression is 1, then for n=2, it's (2*1 + 1) * 1 = 3, which matches. For n=2, the expression is 3. Then for n=3, it would be (2*2 + 1)*3 = 5*3=15, which matches. So that works. So induction seems to work here. 

But wait, is that correct? Let me check the induction step again. 

Assume that for n, the expression is integer. Then for n + 1, we have (2(n + 1))! / (2^{n + 1} (n + 1)! ) = [ (2n + 2)(2n + 1)(2n)! ] / [ 2^{n + 1} (n + 1)! ].

Breaking down 2n + 2 as 2(n + 1), so:

[ 2(n + 1)(2n + 1)(2n)! ] / [ 2^{n + 1} (n + 1)! ] = [ (2n + 1)(2n)! ] / [ 2^n (n + 1) * n! ] * 2(n + 1) / 2(n + 1) ?

Wait, no, let me redo that. Let me write denominator as 2^{n + 1} (n + 1)! = 2 * 2^n * (n + 1) * n!.

Therefore, the entire expression becomes [2(n + 1)(2n + 1)(2n)! ] / [ 2 * 2^n (n + 1) n! ].

Cancel out the 2 in numerator and denominator, cancel out (n + 1) in numerator and denominator. So we get [ (2n + 1)(2n)! ] / [ 2^n n! ].

Which is (2n + 1) * [ (2n)! / (2^n n! ) ].

Since by induction hypothesis, [ (2n)! / (2^n n! ) ] is integer, and (2n + 1) is integer, so the product is integer. Therefore, the induction step holds.

Therefore, by mathematical induction, the expression is integer for all n ≥ 0. 

But maybe I should check another approach as well, just to make sure. Maybe using the concept of Legendre's formula, which gives the exponent of a prime in the factorization of a factorial. Maybe I can check that for each prime, the exponent in the numerator is at least as much as in the denominator.

But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, think of the expression as the number of ways to choose something. Wait, the central binomial coefficient is (2n choose n) = (2n)! / (n! n!). So, our expression is (2n)! / (2^n n!) = (2n choose n) * n! / 2^n. Wait, but is that helpful? Maybe not directly. However, I know that (2n choose n) is an integer, but then multiplying by n! / 2^n... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe think of the expression as the product of (n + k)/2 for k from 1 to n. So, if I can show that this product is integer. Let me think of pairing terms. For example, when n is even or odd? Maybe not. Alternatively, think of the product as (n+1)(n+2)...(2n)/2^n. Let me note that in the numerator, there are n terms. Each term is from n+1 to 2n. Let me note that in the numerator, there are n numbers, and each is between n+1 and 2n. 

Alternatively, think of the product as the product of numbers from n+1 to 2n divided by 2^n. Let me think of each term in the numerator as being paired with a denominator term. For example, if I have numbers from n+1 to 2n, and divide each by 2. But since n+1 to 2n includes both even and odd numbers, maybe some of them are divisible by 2, but not all. However, when multiplied together, the denominators 2^n would divide the product?

Alternatively, think of the product as the number of ways to arrange something. For example, suppose you have 2n people, and you want to arrange them in some way... Not sure. Alternatively, think of the expression as the number of ways to choose n objects from 2n, divided by something? Not sure.

Alternatively, think of the expression as the number of ways to arrange n pairs... Maybe not.

Alternatively, think of the expression as the number of ways to partition something. Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, think of the expression as the number of ways to arrange n objects and n objects... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe think of the expression as the number of ways to choose a subset of size n from 2n elements, but divided by something? Wait, (2n choose n) is the number of subsets of size n, which is equal to (2n)! / (n! n!). So, our expression is (2n)! / (2^n n!) = (2n choose n) * n! / 2^n. So, if we can show that (2n choose n) * n! / 2^n is integer, then that would be the case. But how?

Alternatively, maybe (2n choose n) is divisible by 2^n / something? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps there is a formula for (2n)! / (2^n n!) which is known as the double factorial or something else? Wait, the double factorial is (2n)!! = 2^n n! So, (2n)! / (2^n n!) is equal to (2n)!! / (2^n n!) ? Wait, no. Wait, (2n)! = (2n)!! * (2n - 1)!!. So, (2n)! = product of even numbers up to 2n times product of odd numbers up to 2n - 1. Therefore, (2n)! = (2^n n!) * (2n - 1)!!. Therefore, (2n)! / (2^n n!) = (2n - 1)!!. 

Wait, that seems important. So, (2n)! / (2^n n!) equals the double factorial (2n - 1)!!. But the double factorial of an odd number is the product of all the odd numbers up to that number. So, for example, (2n - 1)!! = (2n - 1)(2n - 3)...(3)(1). Which is an integer, obviously. Therefore, since (2n)! / (2^n n!) equals (2n - 1)!!, which is an integer, then the original expression is integer. 

Therefore, that's another way to see it. So, if I can recall that (2n)! = (2^n n!) * (2n - 1)!!, then dividing both sides by 2^n n! gives (2n)! / (2^n n!) = (2n - 1)!!. Which is an integer. Therefore, that's a proof. 

But maybe I need to verify that formula. Let me check for n=1: (2)! = 2 = 2^1 * 1! * (1)!!. Since (1)!! = 1, so 2 = 2*1*1, which is correct. For n=2: 4! = 24. 2^2 * 2! * (3)!! = 4 * 2 * 3 = 24. Correct. For n=3: 6! = 720. 2^3 * 3! * (5)!! = 8 * 6 * 15 = 8 * 90 = 720. Correct. So, yes, that formula holds. Therefore, (2n)! = 2^n n! (2n - 1)!!. Therefore, the expression is (2n - 1)!!, which is an integer. Therefore, done. 

So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the expression is an integer. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of the double factorial. But maybe the user expects a more elementary proof, like induction or something else. 

Alternatively, think of the expression as the number of ways to arrange something. For example, suppose you have 2n people, and you want to pair them up. The number of ways to pair up 2n people is (2n - 1)!!. Wait, actually, the number of ways to pair up 2n people is (2n)! / (2^n n!), which is exactly our expression. Therefore, since the number of ways must be an integer, that's a combinatorial proof. 

Yes! That's a good point. The expression (2n)! / (2^n n!) counts the number of ways to pair up 2n people into n pairs. Since this is a combinatorial quantity, it must be an integer. Therefore, that's a proof. 

So, for example, if you have 2n people, and you want to pair them up into n pairs, the number of ways is (2n)! divided by (2^n n!). The division by 2^n accounts for the fact that the order of the pairs doesn't matter, and the division by n! accounts for the fact that the order of the pairs themselves doesn't matter. Therefore, this must be an integer. 

Therefore, this is a combinatorial proof. 

Alternatively, if I want to use induction, as I did before, that also works. 

Alternatively, using Legendre's formula, which tells us about the exponents of primes in factorials. Let me try that approach as well, to see if I can get another confirmation.

Legendre's formula says that for any prime p and integer m, the exponent of p in m! is given by the sum floor(m/p^k) for k from 1 to infinity. 

So, to show that (2n)! / (2^n n!) is integer, we need to show that for every prime p, the exponent of p in (2n)! is at least the exponent of p in 2^n n!.

So, let me compute the exponent of p in (2n)! and compare it with the exponent in 2^n n!.

First, exponent of p in 2^n n! is exponent of p in 2^n plus exponent of p in n!.

The exponent of p in 2^n is n * exponent of p in 2. Since 2 is a prime, exponent of p in 2 is 1 if p=2, else 0. Therefore, exponent of p in 2^n is n if p=2, else 0.

Therefore, for p ≠ 2, exponent of p in denominator is exponent of p in n!.

For p=2, exponent of p in denominator is n + exponent of p in n!.

Therefore, for each prime p, we need to check that exponent of p in (2n)! is at least exponent of p in denominator.

So, for p ≠ 2: exponent in numerator is sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(2n / p^k). Exponent in denominator is sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(n / p^k). Therefore, we need to check that sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(2n / p^k) ≥ sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(n / p^k). Which is true because floor(2n / p^k) ≥ floor(n / p^k) + floor(n / p^k) ? Not exactly, but in general, floor(2n / p^k) ≥ floor(n / p^k) + floor(n / p^k) is not always true, but actually, floor(2n / p^k) ≥ floor(n / p^k) + floor(n / p^k) is not necessarily, but actually, floor(2n / p^k) ≥ floor(n / p^k) + floor(n / p^k) is not necessarily true. Wait, but actually, for any real numbers a and b, floor(a) + floor(b) ≤ floor(a + b). Therefore, floor(n / p^k) + floor(n / p^k) ≤ floor(2n / p^k). Therefore, sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(2n / p^k) ≥ 2 * sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(n / p^k). But wait, but the exponent in the denominator is sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(n / p^k). Therefore, if we have sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(2n / p^k) ≥ sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(n / p^k). Which is certainly true because floor(2n / p^k) ≥ floor(n / p^k). But actually, even more, since floor(2n / p^k) ≥ floor(n / p^k). Therefore, sum_{k} floor(2n / p^k) ≥ sum_{k} floor(n / p^k). Therefore, for p ≠ 2, the exponent in numerator is at least as much as in denominator.

For p=2, we need to check that exponent of 2 in (2n)! is at least n + exponent of 2 in n!.

Let me compute exponent of 2 in (2n)! is sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(2n / 2^k). And exponent of 2 in denominator is n + sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(n / 2^k). Therefore, we need to check that sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(2n / 2^k) ≥ n + sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(n / 2^k).

Let me compute sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(2n / 2^k) = sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(n / 2^{k - 1}) = sum_{m=0}^∞ floor(n / 2^m) where m = k - 1. Therefore, sum_{m=0}^∞ floor(n / 2^m) = floor(n / 2^0) + sum_{m=1}^∞ floor(n / 2^m) = n + sum_{m=1}^∞ floor(n / 2^m). Therefore, sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(2n / 2^k) = n + sum_{m=1}^∞ floor(n / 2^m). Therefore, exponent of 2 in (2n)! is equal to n + sum_{m=1}^∞ floor(n / 2^m). Therefore, exponent of 2 in numerator is equal to exponent of 2 in denominator (which is n + sum_{m=1}^∞ floor(n / 2^m)). Therefore, they are equal. Therefore, for p=2, the exponents are equal. Therefore, for all primes p, the exponent in numerator is at least as much as in denominator. Therefore, the expression is integer.

Therefore, using Legendre's formula, we can show that the expression is integer. 

So, that's another way to see it. 

Therefore, multiple approaches: induction, combinatorial interpretation, Legendre's formula. All of them lead to the conclusion that (2n)! / (2^n n!) is an integer for all n ≥ 0. 

Therefore, the answer is that it is an integer, and we have shown it through multiple methods. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\text{The expression is an integer for all } n \geq 0.}
</think>

To show that the expression  
$$
\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}
$$  
is an integer for all $ n \geq 0 $, we will analyze the structure of the expression and use multiple methods to confirm its integrality.

---

### **1. Combinatorial Interpretation**

We consider the expression as counting the number of ways to partition $ 2n $ distinct objects into $ n $ **unordered pairs**. The total number of ways to arrange $ 2n $ objects is $ (2n)! $. However, since the order of the pairs and the order within each pair doesn't matter, we divide by:

- $ 2^n $: to account for the fact that each pair can be ordered in 2 ways.
- $ n! $: to account for the fact that the order of the $ n $ pairs themselves doesn't matter.

Thus, the number of such pairings is:
$$
\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}
$$
This is a well-defined integer, as it represents the number of distinct pairings of $ 2n $ objects. Hence, the expression is an integer.

---

### **2. Inductive Proof**

We will use **mathematical induction** to prove that the expression is an integer for all $ n \geq 0 $.

**Base case ($ n = 0 $)**:
$$
\frac{(2 \cdot 0)!}{2^0 \cdot 0!} = \frac{1}{1 \cdot 1} = 1
$$
which is an integer.

**Inductive step**:
Assume that for some $ n \geq 0 $, the expression $ \frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!} $ is an integer. We need to show that:
$$
\frac{(2(n+1))!}{2^{n+1} (n+1)!}
$$
is also an integer.

We write:
$$
(2(n+1))! = (2n + 2)(2n + 1)(2n)!
$$
So,
$$
\frac{(2n + 2)(2n + 1)(2n)!}{2^{n+1} (n+1)!} = \frac{(2n + 2)(2n + 1)(2n)!}{2 \cdot 2^n \cdot (n+1) \cdot n!}
$$
Simplifying:
$$
= \frac{(2n + 1)(2n)!}{2^n n!}
$$
By the inductive hypothesis, $ \frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!} $ is an integer, and $ 2n + 1 $ is also an integer. Therefore, the product is an integer.

Thus, the expression is an integer for all $ n \geq 0 $.

---

### **3. Using Legendre’s Formula**

We can also use **Legendre’s formula**, which gives the exponent of a prime $ p $ in $ m! $ as:
$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac{m}{p^k} \right\rfloor
$$
We analyze the expression:
$$
\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}
$$
We need to show that for every prime $ p $, the exponent of $ p $ in the numerator is at least as large as in the denominator.

- For $ p \ne 2 $, the exponent of $ p $ in the denominator is $ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor $, and in the numerator it is $ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac{2n}{p^k} \right\rfloor $. Since $ \left\lfloor \frac{2n}{p^k} \right\rfloor \geq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor $, the numerator has at least as many exponents of $ p $.

- For $ p = 2 $, the exponent in the denominator is $ n + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2^k} \right\rfloor $, and in the numerator it is $ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac{2n}{2^k} \right\rfloor = n + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2^k} \right\rfloor $, which is equal to the denominator. Hence, the exponents of 2 match.

Therefore, the expression is an integer for all $ n \geq 0 $.

---

### **Conclusion**

We have shown using multiple approaches — **combinatorial interpretation**, **mathematical induction**, and **Legendre’s formula** — that the expression
$$
\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}
$$
is an integer for all $ n \geq 0 $.

$$
\boxed{\text{The expression is an integer for all } n \geq 0.}
$$
