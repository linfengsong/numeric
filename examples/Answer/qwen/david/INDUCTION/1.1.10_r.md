Okay, so I need to prove these two inequalities and equations using mathematical induction. Let me start with part (a). The problem says that for all n ≥ 1, the sum 1/1² + 1/2² + ... + 1/n² is less than or equal to 2 - 1/n. Hmm. Alright, induction. So first, I need to check the base case, then assume it's true for some k, and then prove it for k+1.

Starting with the base case, n=1. Let me compute the left side: 1/1² = 1. The right side is 2 - 1/1 = 2 - 1 = 1. So 1 ≤ 1, which is true. Okay, base case holds.

Now, assume that for some integer k ≥ 1, the inequality holds: 1/1² + 1/2² + ... + 1/k² ≤ 2 - 1/k. Now, need to show that for n = k+1, the sum up to 1/(k+1)² is ≤ 2 - 1/(k+1).

So, the left side for n = k+1 is the previous sum plus 1/(k+1)². By the induction hypothesis, that's ≤ (2 - 1/k) + 1/(k+1)². So need to show that (2 - 1/k) + 1/(k+1)² ≤ 2 - 1/(k+1).

Let me rearrange this inequality. Subtract 2 from both sides: -1/k + 1/(k+1)² ≤ -1/(k+1). Multiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality): 1/k - 1/(k+1)² ≥ 1/(k+1).

So need to check if 1/k - 1/(k+1)² ≥ 1/(k+1). Let me compute the left side:

1/k - 1/(k+1)². Let me get a common denominator. The common denominator would be k(k+1)². So:

[ (k+1)² - k ] / [k(k+1)²] ≥ 1/(k+1).

Compute numerator: (k² + 2k + 1) - k = k² + k + 1.

So the left side is (k² + k + 1)/[k(k+1)²]. The right side is 1/(k+1). Let me write both sides with denominator k(k+1)²:

Left side: (k² + k + 1)/[k(k+1)²]

Right side: [k(k+1)] / [k(k+1)²] = [k(k+1)] / [k(k+1)²] = 1/(k+1). Wait, no:

Wait, if I want to compare (k² + k + 1)/[k(k+1)²] ≥ 1/(k+1), then cross-multiplying (since denominators are positive):

(k² + k + 1) ≥ [k(k+1)²]/(k+1) = k(k+1). Because multiplying both sides by k(k+1)², which is positive.

So, the inequality reduces to k² + k + 1 ≥ k(k + 1). Let me compute the right side: k(k + 1) = k² + k. Therefore, the inequality is k² + k + 1 ≥ k² + k, which is obviously true because 1 ≥ 0. Therefore, the original inequality holds. Therefore, the step is valid. Therefore, by induction, the inequality holds for all n ≥ 1.

Wait, that seems okay. Let me check with n=2. For n=2, the sum is 1 + 1/4 = 1.25. The right side is 2 - 1/2 = 1.5. 1.25 ≤ 1.5, which is true. For n=3: sum is 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 ≈ 1.361, and 2 - 1/3 ≈ 1.666..., which is true. So seems okay.

But wait, let me check for n=1, which we did. So maybe that's correct. So part (a) is done. Okay.

Now part (b): need to prove that the sum 1/2 + 2/2² + 3/2³ + ... + n/2ⁿ = 2 - (n + 2)/2ⁿ. Again, mathematical induction. So first, check base case n=1.

Left side: 1/2. Right side: 2 - (1 + 2)/2¹ = 2 - 3/2 = 1/2. So equality holds. Good.

Now assume that for some k ≥ 1, the sum up to k/2ᵏ equals 2 - (k + 2)/2ᵏ. Need to show that for n = k + 1, the sum up to (k+1)/2^{k+1} equals 2 - ( (k + 1) + 2 ) / 2^{k + 1} = 2 - (k + 3)/2^{k + 1}.

So, the sum for n = k + 1 is the sum up to k/2ᵏ plus (k + 1)/2^{k + 1}.

By the induction hypothesis, that sum is [2 - (k + 2)/2ᵏ] + (k + 1)/2^{k + 1}.

Let me compute this expression:

First, write 2 as 2 * 2^{k + 1}/2^{k + 1} to have a common denominator? Maybe not. Let me combine the terms.

Let me write [2 - (k + 2)/2ᵏ] + (k + 1)/2^{k + 1} = 2 - (k + 2)/2ᵏ + (k + 1)/2^{k + 1}.

Let me express both fractions with denominator 2^{k + 1}:

- (k + 2)/2ᵏ = -2(k + 2)/2^{k + 1}

Therefore, the entire expression becomes:

2 - [2(k + 2) - (k + 1)] / 2^{k + 1} ?

Wait, let me do it step by step:

Original expression: 2 - (k + 2)/2ᵏ + (k + 1)/2^{k + 1}

Let me compute the two fractions:

- (k + 2)/2ᵏ + (k + 1)/2^{k + 1} = - (k + 2)/2ᵏ + (k + 1)/(2*2ᵏ) = [ -2(k + 2) + (k + 1) ] / 2^{k + 1}

Compute numerator: -2k - 4 + k + 1 = (-2k + k) + (-4 + 1) = -k - 3.

Therefore, the entire expression is 2 + (-k - 3)/2^{k + 1} = 2 - (k + 3)/2^{k + 1}, which is exactly the right-hand side for n = k + 1. Therefore, the induction step holds. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1.

Wait, but let me check with n=2. For n=2, the sum is 1/2 + 2/4 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. The formula says 2 - (2 + 2)/2² = 2 - 4/4 = 2 - 1 = 1. Correct. For n=3: sum is 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/8 = 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.375 = 1.375. The formula: 2 - (3 + 2)/2³ = 2 - 5/8 = 16/8 - 5/8 = 11/8 = 1.375. Correct. So seems okay.

Therefore, part (b) is proven.

But wait, let me think again about the induction step. When I combined the terms, I had:

Original expression: 2 - (k + 2)/2ᵏ + (k + 1)/2^{k + 1}

Which became 2 + [ - (k + 2)/2ᵏ + (k + 1)/2^{k + 1} ]

Then converting the first term to denominator 2^{k + 1}:

- (k + 2)/2ᵏ = -2(k + 2)/2^{k + 1}

Therefore, adding (k + 1)/2^{k + 1} gives:

[ -2(k + 2) + (k + 1) ] / 2^{k + 1} = [ -2k -4 + k + 1 ] / 2^{k + 1} = (-k - 3)/2^{k + 1}

Therefore, total expression is 2 + (-k - 3)/2^{k + 1} = 2 - (k + 3)/2^{k + 1}, which is exactly the formula for n = k + 1. So that's correct. Therefore, the induction step is valid.

Therefore, both parts (a) and (b) are proven by mathematical induction.

But wait, for part (a), I had to show that adding 1/(k+1)^2 to the left side doesn't exceed the right side. The key step was showing that 1/k - 1/(k+1)^2 ≥ 1/(k+1). Which reduced to k² + k + 1 ≥ k² + k, which is true. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the difference between 2 - 1/k and 2 - 1/(k+1) is 1/(k+1) - 1/k = -1/(k(k+1)), but adding 1/(k+1)^2. Wait, maybe another way to think about it. But the previous steps seem correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the inequality:

Sum_{i=1}^n 1/i² ≤ 2 - 1/n.

But I know that the infinite sum is π²/6 ≈ 1.6449, which is less than 2. So for all n, the partial sum is approaching that value, so 2 - 1/n is decreasing, approaching 2. So for n=1, 2 - 1/1 = 1, which is equal to the sum. For n=2, 2 - 1/2 = 1.5, which is bigger than 1.25. For n=3, 2 - 1/3 ≈ 1.666..., which is bigger than the sum ≈ 1.361. So the inequality seems to hold. But the induction proof is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there is a way to bound the sum. For example, using integrals? But since the problem says to use induction, I think the way I did is okay.

Therefore, I think both parts are proven correctly. So the answers are both proven by induction.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{2 - \frac{1}{n}}  
(b) \boxed{2 - \frac{n + 2}{2^n}}
</think>

To prove the given inequalities and equations using **mathematical induction**, we proceed in two parts:

---

### **Part (a):**  
Prove that  
$$
\frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{n^2} \leq 2 - \frac{1}{n}
$$
for all $ n \geq 1 $.

---

#### **Base Case (n = 1):**

$$
\text{LHS} = \frac{1}{1^2} = 1, \quad \text{RHS} = 2 - \frac{1}{1} = 1
$$
So, $ 1 \leq 1 $, which is true.

---

#### **Inductive Step:**

Assume the inequality holds for some $ k \geq 1 $, i.e.,

$$
\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{i^2} \leq 2 - \frac{1}{k}
$$

We need to show that the inequality holds for $ n = k+1 $, i.e.,

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \frac{1}{i^2} \leq 2 - \frac{1}{k+1}
$$

Using the inductive hypothesis:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \frac{1}{i^2} = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{i^2} + \frac{1}{(k+1)^2} \leq \left(2 - \frac{1}{k} \right) + \frac{1}{(k+1)^2}
$$

Now, we must show that:

$$
2 - \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{(k+1)^2} \leq 2 - \frac{1}{k+1}
$$

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

$$
- \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{(k+1)^2} \leq - \frac{1}{k+1}
$$

Multiply both sides by $-1$ (reversing the inequality):

$$
\frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{(k+1)^2} \geq \frac{1}{k+1}
$$

Now, compute the left-hand side:

$$
\frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{(k+1)^2} = \frac{(k+1)^2 - k}{k(k+1)^2}
$$

Expanding the numerator:

$$
(k+1)^2 - k = k^2 + 2k + 1 - k = k^2 + k + 1
$$

So the expression becomes:

$$
\frac{k^2 + k + 1}{k(k+1)^2}
$$

Compare this with the right-hand side:

$$
\frac{1}{k+1} = \frac{k(k+1)}{k(k+1)^2}
$$

Now, compare the numerators:

$$
k^2 + k + 1 \geq k(k+1) = k^2 + k
$$

This is clearly true since $ 1 \geq 0 $.

Thus, the inequality holds, and the inductive step is complete.

---

### **Part (b):**  
Prove that  
$$
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{2^2} + \frac{3}{2^3} + \ldots + \frac{n}{2^n} = 2 - \frac{n + 2}{2^n}
$$

---

#### **Base Case (n = 1):**

$$
\text{LHS} = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \text{RHS} = 2 - \frac{1 + 2}{2^1} = 2 - \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

So, $ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} $, which is true.

---

#### **Inductive Step:**

Assume the identity holds for some $ k \geq 1 $, i.e.,

$$
\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{i}{2^i} = 2 - \frac{k + 2}{2^k}
$$

We need to show that it holds for $ n = k + 1 $, i.e.,

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \frac{i}{2^i} = 2 - \frac{(k+1) + 2}{2^{k+1}} = 2 - \frac{k + 3}{2^{k+1}}
$$

Using the inductive hypothesis:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \frac{i}{2^i} = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{i}{2^i} + \frac{k+1}{2^{k+1}} = \left(2 - \frac{k+2}{2^k} \right) + \frac{k+1}{2^{k+1}}
$$

Now, combine the terms:

$$
2 - \frac{k+2}{2^k} + \frac{k+1}{2^{k+1}} = 2 - \left( \frac{2(k+2)}{2^{k+1}} - \frac{k+1}{2^{k+1}} \right)
$$

$$
= 2 - \frac{2(k+2) - (k+1)}{2^{k+1}} = 2 - \frac{2k + 4 - k - 1}{2^{k+1}} = 2 - \frac{k + 3}{2^{k+1}}
$$

Which is the desired result.

---

### **Final Answers**

(a) $\boxed{2 - \frac{1}{n}}$  
(b) $\boxed{2 - \frac{n + 2}{2^n}}$
