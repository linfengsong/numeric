Okay, so I need to verify that for all n ≥ 1, the product 2 · 6 · 10 · 14 · ... · (4n - 2) equals (2n)! divided by n!. Then, using that result, I have to show that 2^n(n!)^2 ≤ (2n)! for all n ≥ 1. Let me start with part (a).

First, let me understand the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation. The product is 2 times 6 times 10 times 14, and so on, up to (4n - 2). Each term in the product is of the form 4k - 2 where k starts at 1 and goes up to n. Let me check for small values of n to see if I can spot a pattern or maybe figure out how to express this product in terms of factorials.

For n = 1: The product is just 2. On the right-hand side (RHS), (2*1)! / 1! = 2! / 1! = 2 / 1 = 2. So that works.

For n = 2: The product is 2 * 6 = 12. RHS is (4)! / 2! = 24 / 2 = 12. That also works.

For n = 3: Product is 2 * 6 * 10 = 120. RHS is 6! / 3! = 720 / 6 = 120. Still works.

n = 4: 2 * 6 * 10 * 14 = 2*6=12, 12*10=120, 120*14=1680. RHS is 8! / 4! = 40320 / 24 = 1680. Perfect. So it seems to hold for these values. Now I need to prove it for all n ≥ 1.

So, how can I express the product 2 * 6 * 10 * ... * (4n - 2) in terms of factorials? Let me think.

Each term in the product is 4k - 2 for k from 1 to n. Alternatively, I can factor out a 2 from each term: 2*(1), 2*(3), 2*(5), ..., 2*(2n - 1). Wait, let's check:

If I factor 2 out of each term, then each term becomes 2*(something). For example:

First term: 2 = 2*1

Second term: 6 = 2*3

Third term: 10 = 2*5

...

Last term: 4n - 2 = 2*(2n - 1). Yes, exactly. Therefore, the entire product can be written as:

Product_{k=1}^n [2*(2k - 1)] = 2^n * Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1)

So, the LHS is 2^n multiplied by the product of the first n odd numbers. Now, how does that relate to factorials?

I know that the product of the first n odd numbers is (2n)! divided by (2^n n!). Wait, let me recall that:

(2n)! = product_{k=1}^{2n} k = [product of even numbers] * [product of odd numbers]

The product of even numbers from 2 to 2n is 2^n * n! because each even number is 2k where k goes from 1 to n. Therefore:

(2n)! = [2^n * n!] * [product of odd numbers from 1 to 2n - 1]

Therefore, product of odd numbers from 1 to 2n - 1 is (2n)! / (2^n n!). Therefore, the product of the first n odd numbers, which is Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) = (2n)! / (2^n n!). 

Wait, but in our case, the product is Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1). But if we take n terms, then the product is (2n)! divided by (2^n n!). Therefore, substituting back into our LHS:

LHS = 2^n * [ (2n)! / (2^n n!) ] = (2n)! / n!

Which is exactly the RHS. Therefore, the equality holds. Therefore, part (a) is proven.

Wait, let me check again. Let me write it step by step.

Starting with the product 2 * 6 * 10 * ... * (4n - 2) = Product_{k=1}^n (4k - 2) = Product_{k=1}^n [2*(2k - 1)] = 2^n * Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1)

Now, as I said, the product of the first n odd numbers is Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) = (2n)! / (2^n n!). Therefore, substituting:

LHS = 2^n * [ (2n)! / (2^n n!) ] = (2n)! / n!

Which is exactly the RHS. Therefore, the equality is verified. Therefore, part (a) is done.

Now, moving on to part (b). Use part (a) to obtain the inequality 2^n (n!)^2 ≤ (2n)! for all n ≥ 1.

Hmm. So, from part (a), we have that the product 2 * 6 * 10 * ... * (4n - 2) equals (2n)! / n!.

But also, from part (a), we can write that product as 2^n * Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) = (2n)! / n!.

But maybe another way to think about this is to relate the product 2 * 6 * 10 * ... * (4n - 2) to something else. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the result from part (a) to express (2n)! as n! multiplied by that product, and then compare it to 2^n (n!)^2.

Wait, from part (a), we have:

(2n)! = n! * [2 * 6 * 10 * ... * (4n - 2)].

But from part (a), that product is equal to (2n)! / n! as given. Wait, that seems redundant. Wait, but maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the expression for the product in terms of factorials. From part (a), we have:

Product_{k=1}^n (4k - 2) = (2n)! / n!.

But also, note that 2 * 6 * 10 * ... * (4n - 2) is equal to 2^n times the product of the first n odd numbers. Which we also found to be (2n)! / (2^n n!) as per the previous step. Wait, but that seems like we already used that.

But perhaps we need to relate this to (n!)^2. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the expression for (2n)! from part (a). Let me recall that (2n)! = n! * [product from k=1 to n of (2k - 1) * 2]. Wait, no, that's what we had before.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that (2n)! = (2n)(2n - 1)(2n - 2)...(1). Which is equal to [product of even numbers] * [product of odd numbers]. As before.

But the product of even numbers is 2^n * n! as before, and product of odd numbers is (2n)! / (2^n n!). Therefore, the product of odd numbers is (2n)! / (2^n n!). Therefore, if we take that product of odd numbers, which is Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) = (2n)! / (2^n n!).

But then, if I multiply both sides by 2^n n! I get (2n)! = 2^n n! * Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1). But that's the same as before.

But how does that help me get the inequality?

Wait, the inequality is 2^n (n!)^2 ≤ (2n)!.

So, if I can show that (2n)! ≥ 2^n (n!)^2, then that's the inequality. So, perhaps using the expression from part (a), which is (2n)! = n! * [Product_{k=1}^n (4k - 2)].

But Product_{k=1}^n (4k - 2) = 2^n * Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1). Therefore, (2n)! = n! * 2^n * Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1). Therefore, (2n)! = 2^n * n! * Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1). Therefore, if I can show that Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) ≥ n! then multiplying both sides by 2^n n! would give me (2n)! ≥ 2^n (n!)^2.

Wait, let me check that. If Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) ≥ n! then:

(2n)! = 2^n * n! * Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) ≥ 2^n * n! * n! = 2^n (n!)^2.

Therefore, if I can show that Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) ≥ n! then the inequality follows.

But is Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) ≥ n! ?

Let me check for small n.

For n = 1: Product is 1. n! = 1. So 1 ≥ 1, which is true.

n = 2: Product is 1 * 3 = 3. n! = 2. 3 ≥ 2, true.

n = 3: 1 * 3 * 5 = 15. n! = 6. 15 ≥ 6, true.

n = 4: 1*3*5*7=105. 4! = 24. 105 ≥ 24, true.

So seems like it's true. Therefore, if we can show that Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) ≥ n! then the inequality follows.

But how to show that? Let me think. Maybe by induction?

Alternatively, note that 2k - 1 ≥ k for k ≥ 1?

Wait, for k ≥ 1, 2k - 1 ≥ k ⇨ 2k - 1 ≥ k ⇨ k ≥ 1. Which is true. Therefore, each term in the product Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) is ≥ k. Therefore, the product is ≥ Product_{k=1}^n k = n!.

Therefore, Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) ≥ n!.

Therefore, (2n)! = 2^n * n! * Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) ≥ 2^n * n! * n! = 2^n (n!)^2.

Therefore, (2n)! ≥ 2^n (n!)^2. Hence, the inequality holds.

Alternatively, since we have from part (a) that (2n)! = n! * Product_{k=1}^n (4k - 2). And since Product_{k=1}^n (4k - 2) = 2^n * Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) ≥ 2^n * n! as above. Therefore, (2n)! = n! * Product_{k=1}^n (4k - 2) ≥ n! * 2^n * n! = 2^n (n!)^2. Therefore, the inequality holds.

Alternatively, since we have from part (a) that (2n)! / n! = Product_{k=1}^n (4k - 2). Therefore, (2n)! / n! ≥ 2^n * Product_{k=1}^n (something). Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, but we already have that Product_{k=1}^n (4k - 2) = 2^n * Product_{k=1}^n (2k - 1) ≥ 2^n * n! as shown above, so (2n)! / n! ≥ 2^n * n! ⇒ (2n)! ≥ 2^n (n!)^2. Therefore, that's the inequality.

Therefore, the inequality follows from part (a). Therefore, part (b) is done.

But let me check if there's another way to see this. For example, using the result from part (a), which is that (2n)! / n! = Product_{k=1}^n (4k - 2). So, if I can show that Product_{k=1}^n (4k - 2) ≥ 2^n (n!)^2 / n! = 2^n n!.

Wait, that would be (2n)! / n! ≥ 2^n n! ⇒ (2n)! ≥ 2^n (n!)^2. Which is the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps using the expression for (2n)! as (2n)(2n - 1)(2n - 2)...(1). Let me compare this to 2^n (n!)^2.

Note that 2^n (n!)^2 = 2*2*...*2 (n times) * n! * n! = product of 2s times product of 1*2*...*n times product of 1*2*...*n.

But (2n)! is the product of numbers from 1 to 2n. Let me pair the terms:

(2n)! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * (2n - 1) * 2n.

If I group them as (1 * 3 * 5 * ... * (2n - 1)) * (2 * 4 * 6 * ... * 2n). The first product is the product of odd numbers, the second is the product of even numbers. The second product is 2^n * n! as before. The first product is (2n)! / (2^n n!) as before. Therefore, (2n)! = [ (2n)! / (2^n n!) ] * 2^n n! = (2n)!.

But how does that relate to 2^n (n!)^2?

Well, if I compare (2n)! to 2^n (n!)^2, then:

(2n)! = [product of odds] * [product of evens] = [product of odds] * 2^n n!.

So, if I can show that [product of odds] ≥ n! then (2n)! ≥ 2^n n! * n! = 2^n (n!)^2.

But [product of odds] is 1 * 3 * 5 * ... * (2n - 1). How do I show that this is ≥ n! ?

Well, for each term in the product of odds, 1, 3, 5,..., 2n - 1. Compare to n!.

Note that n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n.

So, for each term in the product of odds, which is 2k - 1 for k from 1 to n, compare to k. Since 2k - 1 ≥ k for k ≥ 1, as we saw before. Therefore, each term in the product of odds is at least k. Therefore, the product of odds is ≥ product_{k=1}^n k = n!.

Therefore, [product of odds] ≥ n! ⇒ (2n)! = [product of odds] * 2^n n! ≥ n! * 2^n n! = 2^n (n!)^2. Therefore, the inequality is proven.

Alternatively, maybe using induction. Let me try that approach for part (b) as well, just to check.

Base case n = 1: 2^1 (1!)^2 = 2 * 1 = 2. (2*1)! = 2! = 2. So 2 ≤ 2, which is true.

Assume that for some n ≥ 1, 2^n (n!)^2 ≤ (2n)!.

We need to show that 2^{n+1} ((n + 1)!)^2 ≤ (2(n + 1))! = (2n + 2)!.

So, let's see. Let me write (2n + 2)! = (2n + 2)(2n + 1)(2n)!.

From the induction hypothesis, (2n)! ≥ 2^n (n!)^2. Therefore:

(2n + 2)! = (2n + 2)(2n + 1)(2n)! ≥ (2n + 2)(2n + 1) * 2^n (n!)^2.

Now, we need to compare this to 2^{n+1} ((n + 1)!)^2 = 2^{n+1} (n + 1)^2 (n!)^2.

So, let's compute the ratio between (2n + 2)(2n + 1) * 2^n (n!)^2 and 2^{n+1} (n + 1)^2 (n!)^2.

Simplifying, the ratio is [(2n + 2)(2n + 1) / (2^{n+1} (n + 1)^2 / 2^n ) ] ?

Wait, let me compute:

The left side is (2n + 2)(2n + 1) * 2^n (n!)^2.

The right side is 2^{n+1} (n + 1)^2 (n!)^2.

Therefore, the ratio of left to right is [(2n + 2)(2n + 1) * 2^n] / [2^{n+1} (n + 1)^2] = [(2n + 2)(2n + 1)] / [2(n + 1)^2].

Simplify numerator: 2(n + 1)(2n + 1). Therefore, ratio becomes [2(n + 1)(2n + 1)] / [2(n + 1)^2] ] = (2n + 1)/(n + 1).

So, we need to show that (2n + 1)/(n + 1) ≥ 1. Which is equivalent to 2n + 1 ≥ n + 1 ⇒ n ≥ 0. Which is true for n ≥ 1. Therefore, the ratio is ≥ 1, so (2n + 2)! ≥ 2^{n+1} ((n + 1)!)^2. Therefore, by induction, the inequality holds for all n ≥ 1.

Therefore, that also works. So, using induction, we can also show the inequality.

But since part (a) is already given, maybe the first approach is better, using part (a) directly.

Therefore, in conclusion, part (a) is proven by expressing the product as 2^n times the product of odd numbers, which relates to (2n)! via factorial expressions, and part (b) is proven by showing that the product of odd numbers is at least n!, hence (2n)! is at least 2^n (n!)^2.

Therefore, the answer to part (a) is verified, and part (b) follows from that.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{\frac{(2n)!}{n!}}  
(b) \boxed{2^n(n!)^2 \leq (2n)!}
</think>

### (a) Verification of the Identity

We are given the product:

$$
2 \cdot 6 \cdot 10 \cdot 14 \cdots (4n - 2)
$$

Each term in this product can be written as:

$$
4k - 2 = 2(2k - 1), \quad \text{for } k = 1, 2, \ldots, n
$$

Thus, the product becomes:

$$
\prod_{k=1}^{n} (4k - 2) = \prod_{k=1}^{n} [2(2k - 1)] = 2^n \prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1)
$$

Now, recall that the product of the first $ n $ odd numbers is:

$$
\prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1) = \frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}
$$

This is a known identity, derived from the fact that:

$$
(2n)! = \prod_{k=1}^{2n} k = \left( \prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k) \right) \left( \prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1) \right) = 2^n n! \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1)
$$

Solving for the odd product gives:

$$
\prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1) = \frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}
$$

Substituting this back into the expression for the original product:

$$
\prod_{k=1}^{n} (4k - 2) = 2^n \cdot \frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!} = \frac{(2n)!}{n!}
$$

Thus, the identity is verified for all $ n \geq 1 $.

### (b) Deriving the Inequality

From part (a), we know that:

$$
\prod_{k=1}^{n} (4k - 2) = \frac{(2n)!}{n!}
$$

We can rewrite the left-hand side as:

$$
\prod_{k=1}^{n} (4k - 2) = 2^n \prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1)
$$

So:

$$
\frac{(2n)!}{n!} = 2^n \prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1)
$$

Now, we want to show that:

$$
2^n (n!)^2 \leq (2n)!
$$

From the above, we can express $ (2n)! $ as:

$$
(2n)! = n! \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{n} (4k - 2) = n! \cdot 2^n \prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1)
$$

So:

$$
(2n)! = 2^n n! \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1)
$$

We now show that:

$$
\prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1) \geq n!
$$

Each term $ 2k - 1 \geq k $ for $ k \geq 1 $, so the product of the first $ n $ odd numbers is greater than or equal to the product of the first $ n $ natural numbers:

$$
\prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1) \geq \prod_{k=1}^{n} k = n!
$$

Therefore:

$$
(2n)! = 2^n n! \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1) \geq 2^n n! \cdot n! = 2^n (n!)^2
$$

Hence, the inequality holds for all $ n \geq 1 $.

---

### Final Answers

(a) The identity is verified as:

$$
\boxed{\frac{(2n)!}{n!}}
$$

(b) The inequality is proven as:

$$
\boxed{2^n(n!)^2 \leq (2n)!}
$$
