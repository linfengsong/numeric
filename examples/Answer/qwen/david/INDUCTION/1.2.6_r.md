Okay, so I need to derive the binomial identity that says the sum of binomial coefficients where the upper index is even numbers starting from 2 up to 2n, with the lower index fixed at 2, equals n(n+1)(4n-1)/6 for n ≥ 2. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that binomial coefficients have various identities and formulas. Maybe I can use some known formulas or find a way to express the sum in a different form. Let me recall that the sum of binomial coefficients with the lower index fixed can sometimes be related to other combinatorial arguments or formulas.

The given sum is Σ_{k=1}^n [C(2k, 2)]. Wait, hold on, the original problem starts with C(2,2) and goes up to C(2n,2). So if I let k go from 1 to n, then 2k would go from 2 to 2n. So the sum is Σ_{k=1}^n C(2k, 2). But the formula given is n(n+1)(4n - 1)/6. Let me check for small n to see if that works.

Let me test n=2: the left side is C(2,2) + C(4,2) = 1 + 6 = 7. The right side is 2*3*(8 -1)/6 = 2*3*7/6 = 42/6 = 7. Okay, that works. For n=3: left side is C(2,2)+C(4,2)+C(6,2)=1+6+15=22. Right side: 3*4*(12 -1)/6 = 3*4*11/6 = 132/6 = 22. Also works. Good.

So the formula seems correct. Now, how to derive it?

First, let's recall that C(2k, 2) is equal to (2k)(2k - 1)/2. So maybe we can write the sum as Σ_{k=1}^n [ (2k)(2k - 1)/2 ].

Let me compute that:

Sum = (1/2) Σ_{k=1}^n [4k² - 2k] = (1/2)[4 Σk² - 2 Σk].

So that simplifies to (1/2)[4*(n(n+1)(2n+1)/6) - 2*(n(n+1)/2)].

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

First, Σ_{k=1}^n k² is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.

And Σ_{k=1}^n k is n(n+1)/2.

Therefore, substituting:

Sum = (1/2)[4*(n(n+1)(2n+1)/6) - 2*(n(n+1)/2)].

Let me compute each part:

First term inside the brackets: 4*(n(n+1)(2n+1)/6) = (4/6)*n(n+1)(2n+1) = (2/3)*n(n+1)(2n+1).

Second term: 2*(n(n+1)/2) = n(n+1).

Therefore, the entire expression becomes:

(1/2)[ (2/3)n(n+1)(2n+1) - n(n+1) ].

Factor out n(n+1):

(1/2)[ n(n+1) [ (2/3)(2n + 1) - 1 ] ].

Compute the bracketed term:

(2/3)(2n + 1) - 1 = (4n + 2)/3 - 1 = (4n + 2 - 3)/3 = (4n - 1)/3.

Therefore, the entire expression becomes:

(1/2) * n(n+1) * (4n - 1)/3 = [n(n+1)(4n - 1)] / 6.

Which is exactly the formula given! So that seems to work. Therefore, the identity is derived by expressing the binomial coefficient as a quadratic expression and then using the standard formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of integers.

But maybe the problem expects a combinatorial proof instead of algebraic manipulation? Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions or combinatorial arguments. Let me try a combinatorial approach.

Suppose we want to count the number of ways to choose 2 elements from 2k elements, summed over k from 1 to n. Alternatively, maybe there's a combinatorial interpretation of the sum.

Alternatively, think of the sum Σ_{k=1}^n C(2k, 2). Maybe this can be related to some other combinatorial problem.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use recursion or induction. Let me try induction.

Base case n=2: already checked, works.

Assume that for some n ≥ 2, the formula holds: Σ_{k=1}^n C(2k, 2) = n(n+1)(4n -1)/6.

Now, check for n+1: Σ_{k=1}^{n+1} C(2k, 2) = Σ_{k=1}^n C(2k, 2) + C(2(n+1), 2) = [n(n+1)(4n -1)/6] + C(2n + 2, 2).

Compute C(2n + 2, 2) = (2n + 2)(2n + 1)/2 = (2(n + 1))(2n + 1)/2 = (n + 1)(2n + 1).

Therefore, the total sum becomes [n(n+1)(4n -1)/6] + (n + 1)(2n + 1).

Factor out (n + 1):

(n + 1)[n(4n - 1)/6 + (2n + 1)].

Compute the term inside the brackets:

First term: n(4n - 1)/6.

Second term: (2n + 1) = 6(2n + 1)/6.

So adding them:

[ n(4n - 1) + 6(2n + 1) ] / 6.

Compute numerator:

4n² - n + 12n + 6 = 4n² + 11n + 6.

So the entire expression is (n + 1)(4n² + 11n + 6)/6.

Now, factor 4n² + 11n + 6. Let me try to factor it.

Looking for factors of 4*6=24 that add up to 11. 8 and 3: 8*3=24, 8+3=11. So split the middle term:

4n² + 8n + 3n + 6 = 4n(n + 2) + 3(n + 2) = (4n + 3)(n + 2).

Therefore, numerator is (n + 1)(4n + 3)(n + 2).

Thus, the total sum is (n + 1)(n + 2)(4n + 3)/6.

But according to the formula, for n+1, the formula should be (n + 1)(n + 2)(4(n + 1) - 1)/6 = (n + 1)(n + 2)(4n + 4 - 1)/6 = (n + 1)(n + 2)(4n + 3)/6. Which matches! Therefore, the induction step holds. Therefore, by induction, the formula is true for all n ≥ 2.

So that's another way to derive it, using induction.

But the original algebraic approach was straightforward. So maybe the problem expects that method.

Alternatively, another approach: using the formula for the sum of C(2k, 2) from k=1 to n.

But since we already did that, maybe that's sufficient.

Alternatively, think of the sum as C(2,2) + C(4,2) + ... + C(2n,2). Maybe there is a combinatorial interpretation where this sum counts something, and then we can find another expression for that same count.

For example, suppose we want to count the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of size 2k, for k from 1 to n. But I don't see a direct combinatorial interpretation immediately.

Alternatively, think of the sum as the number of pairs in a certain structure. For example, if you have multiple sets, each of size 2k, but that might complicate.

Alternatively, think of the sum as the total number of pairs in all sets of even sizes from 2 to 2n. But not sure.

Alternatively, think of the formula n(n+1)(4n - 1)/6. Maybe we can relate this to some known formula. For example, the formula for the sum of the first n triangular numbers or something else. But maybe not.

Alternatively, think of the sum Σ_{k=1}^n C(2k, 2) as Σ_{k=1}^n [C(2k, 2)].

But since we already have an algebraic proof, maybe that's sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity that Σ_{k=0}^n C(2k, 2) = something, but since our sum starts at k=1, but for k=0, C(0, 2) is 0, so it's the same.

Alternatively, think of generating functions. The generating function for C(2k, 2) is something... Wait, generating functions might be more complicated here, but let me try.

The generating function for C(m, 2) is related to the generating function for m(m-1)/2. But perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, think of the sum as Σ_{k=1}^n C(2k, 2) = Σ_{k=1}^n [ (2k)(2k - 1)/2 ] = Σ_{k=1}^n (2k^2 - k) = 2Σk^2 - Σk, which is the same as before. So that's the same approach as before.

Therefore, the algebraic approach is straightforward. So maybe that's the way to go.

Alternatively, think of the formula n(n+1)(4n -1)/6. Let me check if that can be rewritten as something else. For example, expanding it:

n(n+1)(4n -1) = n(n+1)(4n -1) = 4n^3 - n^2 + 4n^2 -n = 4n^3 + 3n^2 -n. Divided by 6.

But maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, think of the formula as combining terms. But maybe not necessary.

So in conclusion, the algebraic approach by expanding the binomial coefficient into a quadratic expression and then using the standard formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of integers is the way to go. Therefore, the identity is derived as shown.

Therefore, the answer is derived by expressing the sum as a quadratic in k, then using known summation formulas.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}}
</think>

To derive the identity

$$
\binom{2}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{6}{2} + \ldots + \binom{2n}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}, \quad n \geq 2,
$$

we begin by expressing the binomial coefficient $\binom{2k}{2}$ in terms of a quadratic expression:

$$
\binom{2k}{2} = \frac{(2k)(2k - 1)}{2} = 2k^2 - k.
$$

Thus, the sum becomes:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \binom{2k}{2} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k^2 - k).
$$

We can now split the sum into two parts:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k^2 - k) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 - \sum_{k=1}^{n} k.
$$

Using the standard formulas for the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers and the sum of their squares:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}, \quad \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6},
$$

we substitute these into the expression:

$$
2 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
$$

Simplifying the first term:

$$
\frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3}.
$$

Now subtract the second term:

$$
\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
$$

To combine these, we find a common denominator of 6:

$$
\frac{2n(n+1)(2n+1) - 3n(n+1)}{6}.
$$

Factor out $n(n+1)$ from the numerator:

$$
\frac{n(n+1)\left[2(2n+1) - 3\right]}{6}.
$$

Simplify the expression inside the brackets:

$$
2(2n + 1) - 3 = 4n + 2 - 3 = 4n - 1.
$$

Thus, the entire expression becomes:

$$
\frac{n(n+1)(4n - 1)}{6}.
$$

This matches the right-hand side of the given identity, completing the derivation.
