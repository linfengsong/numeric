Okay, so I need to prove that for the sequence defined by a₁=1, a₂=2, a₃=3, and for n ≥ 4, aₙ = aₙ₋₁ + aₙ₋₂ + aₙ₋₃, the inequality aₙ < 2ⁿ holds for every positive integer n. The problem specifies using the Second Principle of Finite Induction, which I remember is also called Strong Induction. Let me recall how that works.

In Strong Induction, to prove that a statement P(n) is true for all positive integers n, we assume that P(k) is true for all k from 1 up to some number m, and then we prove that P(m+1) is true. So, the base cases are checked first, and then the inductive step assumes the truth of all previous cases up to m, not just m-1.

Alright, so first, I need to check the base cases. The problem says "for every positive integer n", so n starts at 1. Let me check n=1, 2, 3.

For n=1: a₁=1. 2¹=2. 1 < 2, which is true.

For n=2: a₂=2. 2²=4. 2 < 4, true.

For n=3: a₃=3. 2³=8. 3 < 8, true.

So the base cases hold. Now, the inductive step. Let's assume that for all positive integers k with 1 ≤ k ≤ m, a_k < 2^k. Now, we need to show that a_{m+1} < 2^{m+1}.

But wait, the recurrence is a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}. So for n = m+1, we have:

a_{m+1} = a_m + a_{m-1} + a_{m-2}

So, if I can show that this sum is less than 2^{m+1}, then the inductive step is done.

But since we have the assumption that for all k ≤ m, a_k < 2^k, then each term in the sum a_m, a_{m-1}, a_{m-2} is less than 2^m, 2^{m-1}, 2^{m-2} respectively.

Therefore, adding them up:

a_{m+1} < 2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2}

So, let me compute that sum:

2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2} = 2^{m-2}(4 + 2 + 1) = 2^{m-2} * 7.

Wait, but I need to show that this is less than 2^{m+1}. Let me check:

Is 7 * 2^{m-2} < 2^{m+1}?

Let me compute 2^{m+1} = 2^{m-2} * 2^3 = 8 * 2^{m-2}

So 7 * 2^{m-2} < 8 * 2^{m-2} is true because 7 < 8. Therefore, yes, the inequality holds.

Therefore, a_{m+1} < 7 * 2^{m-2} < 8 * 2^{m-2} = 2^{m+1}

Therefore, by the Second Principle of Finite Induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n.

Wait, but let me check if this is correct. Let me test with some small values.

For example, let's check n=4. a₄ = a₃ + a₂ + a₁ = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. 2⁴=16. 6 < 16, yes.

n=5: a₅ = a₄ + a₃ + a₂ = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11. 2⁵=32. 11 < 32, yes.

n=6: a₆ = 11 + 6 + 3 = 20. 2⁶=64. 20 < 64, yes.

n=7: a₇ = 20 + 11 + 6 = 37. 2⁷=128. 37 < 128.

So seems like it's working. But let me check if my inductive step is correct. Let me think again.

Assume that for all k ≤ m, a_k < 2^k. Then for a_{m+1} = a_m + a_{m-1} + a_{m-2} < 2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2} = 7*2^{m-2} < 8*2^{m-2} = 2^{m+1}.

Yes, that seems correct.

But wait, is there a case where m is small? For example, when m=3, then m+1=4. Then, the assumption is that for k=1,2,3, which is true. Then a_4 < 2^4. Which is 6 < 16, yes.

But when m=3, the sum 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14. Which is less than 2^4=16. So yes.

But when m=4, then m+1=5. The sum is 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 = 16 + 8 + 4 = 28 < 32=2^5. Correct.

Similarly, for m=5, sum is 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 = 32 + 16 + 8 = 56 < 64=2^6. Correct.

So seems like the logic holds. Therefore, the inductive step is valid.

But wait, is there a case where the upper bound is not tight? For example, if the sum 2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2} is less than 2^{m+1}? Well, as shown before, 2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2} = 7*2^{m-2} and 2^{m+1} = 8*2^{m-2}, so yes, 7 < 8.

Therefore, the inequality holds. Therefore, the inductive step is valid.

Therefore, by Strong Induction, the statement is true for all positive integers n.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says "Use the Second Principle of Finite Induction". So I need to make sure that I have properly applied the strong induction.

In the inductive step, I assumed that for all k ≤ m, the inequality holds, and then I used that to prove for m+1. So that is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the inductive step more formally.

So, the inductive hypothesis is: For all integers k with 1 ≤ k ≤ m, a_k < 2^k.

We need to show that a_{m+1} < 2^{m+1}.

But a_{m+1} = a_m + a_{m-1} + a_{m-2}.

By the inductive hypothesis, each of these terms is less than 2^m, 2^{m-1}, 2^{m-2} respectively. Therefore:

a_{m+1} < 2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2}.

Now, compute the sum:

2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2} = 2^{m-2}(4 + 2 + 1) = 7*2^{m-2}.

But 7*2^{m-2} is less than 8*2^{m-2} = 2^{m+1}, since 7 < 8. Therefore:

a_{m+1} < 2^{m+1}.

Therefore, the inductive step is complete.

Hence, by the Second Principle of Finite Induction, the inequality holds for all positive integers n.

Therefore, the answer is proven.

But let me check for m=1. Wait, when m=1, the inductive step would be for m+1=2. But the base case for m=1 is already checked. Similarly, for m=2, inductive step for m+1=3. Which is also checked. So the inductive step starts from m ≥ 3? Wait, but the inductive step is for m ≥ 1? Wait, no, the inductive step is for m ≥ 3? Because for m=1, m+1=2, which is already covered in the base case. Similarly, for m=2, m+1=3, which is also covered. So the inductive step is valid for m ≥ 3? But the inductive hypothesis is that for all k ≤ m, which for m=3, would include k=1,2,3. So yes, that's okay.

Therefore, the entire proof is valid.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more general way to write the sum. Let me think. For example, 2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2} is equal to 2^{m-2}*(4 + 2 + 1) = 7*2^{m-2} as I had before. Alternatively, maybe I can factor differently?

But regardless, since 7*2^{m-2} < 8*2^{m-2} = 2^{m+1}, so that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can write 2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2} = 2^{m-2} + 2^{m-1} + 2^m = 2^{m-2}(1 + 2 + 4) = 7*2^{m-2}, which is the same.

Therefore, the logic holds.

Therefore, I think this is a correct proof using strong induction.

But let me check if there's another way to approach this. For example, maybe using the fact that the recurrence relation is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with three terms. However, since the problem specifically asks for the Second Principle of Finite Induction, I think the approach I took is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the inequality a_n < 2^n as a kind of bound that can be established through induction. Since the recurrence is a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}, and if each term is less than 2^{n-1}, 2^{n-2}, 2^{n-3}, then their sum is less than 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3} = 2^{n-3}(4 + 2 + 1) = 7*2^{n-3}. But 7*2^{n-3} is less than 2^{n} because 7*2^{n-3} = (7/8)*2^n < 2^n. Therefore, that's another way to see it.

But in the inductive step, we have to use the inductive hypothesis. So, if we have a_{m+1} < 2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2} = 7*2^{m-2} < 2^{m+1}, which is the same as above.

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, the proof is correct.

Hence, the answer is that by using the Second Principle of Finite Induction, we have shown that a_n < 2^n for all positive integers n.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{a_n < 2^n} for every positive integer $ n $.

To prove that the sequence $ a_n $ defined by the recurrence relation

$$
a_1 = 1,\quad a_2 = 2,\quad a_3 = 3,\quad \text{and for } n \geq 4,\quad a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}
$$

satisfies the inequality $ a_n < 2^n $ for all positive integers $ n $, we employ the **Second Principle of Finite Induction**, also known as **Strong Induction**.

### **Step 1: Base Cases**

We begin by checking the inequality for small values of $ n $:

- $ a_1 = 1 $, $ 2^1 = 2 $, so $ 1 < 2 $ ✅
- $ a_2 = 2 $, $ 2^2 = 4 $, so $ 2 < 4 $ ✅
- $ a_3 = 3 $, $ 2^3 = 8 $, so $ 3 < 8 $ ✅

Thus, the base cases $ n = 1, 2, 3 $ satisfy the inequality.

---

### **Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**

Assume that for all integers $ k $ such that $ 1 \leq k \leq m $, the inequality

$$
a_k < 2^k
$$

holds. That is, the inductive hypothesis is that for all $ k \leq m $, $ a_k < 2^k $.

---

### **Step 3: Inductive Step**

We now aim to show that the inequality holds for $ n = m + 1 $, i.e.,

$$
a_{m+1} < 2^{m+1}
$$

Using the recurrence relation:

$$
a_{m+1} = a_m + a_{m-1} + a_{m-2}
$$

By the inductive hypothesis, we know:

$$
a_m < 2^m,\quad a_{m-1} < 2^{m-1},\quad a_{m-2} < 2^{m-2}
$$

Therefore, summing these bounds:

$$
a_{m+1} < 2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2}
$$

Now, we compute the right-hand side:

$$
2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2} = 2^{m-2}(4 + 2 + 1) = 7 \cdot 2^{m-2}
$$

We now compare this with $ 2^{m+1} $:

$$
2^{m+1} = 2^{m-2} \cdot 8
$$

Since $ 7 < 8 $, we have:

$$
7 \cdot 2^{m-2} < 8 \cdot 2^{m-2} = 2^{m+1}
$$

Thus,

$$
a_{m+1} < 2^{m+1}
$$

This completes the inductive step.

---

### **Conclusion**

By the Second Principle of Finite Induction, the inequality $ a_n < 2^n $ holds for all positive integers $ n $.

$$
\boxed{a_n < 2^n}
$$
