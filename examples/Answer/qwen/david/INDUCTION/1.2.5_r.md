Okay, so I need to solve these three parts (a), (b), and (c). Let me start with part (a). The problem says that for n ≥ 2, the sum of binomial coefficients from 2 choose 2 up to n choose 2 equals (n+1) choose 3. Hmm, binomial coefficients... I remember there are some formulas for sums of binomial coefficients. Maybe I can use some combinatorial arguments or induction?

First, let me recall that the binomial coefficient C(k, 2) is equal to k(k-1)/2. So, if I write out the sum:

C(2,2) + C(3,2) + ... + C(n,2) = [2(2-1)/2] + [3(3-1)/2] + ... + [n(n-1)/2]

Simplifying each term, that becomes (2*1)/2 + (3*2)/2 + ... + (n(n-1))/2. Which simplifies further to 1 + 3 + 6 + ... + [n(n-1)/2]. Wait, but maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe there's a combinatorial interpretation. The right-hand side is C(n+1, 3). What does that represent? It's the number of ways to choose 3 elements from n+1 elements. The left-hand side is the sum of C(k, 2) for k from 2 to n. So, maybe there's a way to count the same thing in two different ways?

Let me think. Suppose I want to count the number of ways to choose 3 elements from n+1 elements. Alternatively, maybe I can think of choosing a committee of 3 people where one person is designated as the leader. Wait, but that might not be directly applicable. Alternatively, think of the third element as the largest one. For example, if I fix the largest element in the 3-element subset, then the other two elements are chosen from the elements smaller than it.

So, if I have n+1 elements, say labeled 1, 2, ..., n+1. Let me think of the number of 3-element subsets where the largest element is k. Then, the number of such subsets is C(k-1, 2), since the other two elements are chosen from the first k-1 elements. Therefore, the total number of 3-element subsets is the sum from k=3 to n+1 of C(k-1, 2). Which is the same as sum from m=2 to n of C(m, 2), where m = k-1. Therefore, that sum equals C(n+1, 3). Hence, the identity holds. That seems like a combinatorial proof. So that's part (a).

Alternatively, maybe using induction. Let me try that approach as well, just to verify.

Base case: n=2. Left-hand side is C(2,2) = 1. Right-hand side is C(3,3) = 1. Okay, that works.

Assume it's true for n, so that sum_{k=2}^n C(k, 2) = C(n+1, 3). Now, consider n+1. The sum becomes sum_{k=2}^{n+1} C(k, 2) = sum_{k=2}^n C(k, 2) + C(n+1, 2) = C(n+1, 3) + C(n+1, 2). Now, using the identity C(n+1, 3) + C(n+1, 2) = C(n+2, 3). Wait, because of the Pascal's identity: C(m, k) + C(m, k-1) = C(m+1, k). Here, m = n+1, k = 3. So C(n+1, 3) + C(n+1, 2) = C(n+2, 3). Therefore, the formula holds for n+1. Hence, by induction, the formula is true for all n ≥ 2. So that's another way to prove part (a).

Okay, so part (a) is done. Now moving to part (b). It says to use part (a) and the relation m² = 2*C(m, 2) + m for m ≥ 2 to deduce the formula for the sum of squares 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.

Alright, so first, let me recall that the given relation is m² = 2*C(m, 2) + m. Let me verify that. Since C(m, 2) is m(m-1)/2, so 2*C(m, 2) is m(m-1). Then adding m gives m(m-1) + m = m² - m + m = m². Yes, that works. So that identity is correct.

So, if I sum both sides of this equation from m=2 to m=n, then:

Sum_{m=2}^n m² = Sum_{m=2}^n [2*C(m, 2) + m] = 2*Sum_{m=2}^n C(m, 2) + Sum_{m=2}^n m.

From part (a), we know that Sum_{m=2}^n C(m, 2) = C(n+1, 3). Therefore, substituting that in:

Left-hand side is Sum_{m=2}^n m².

Right-hand side is 2*C(n+1, 3) + Sum_{m=2}^n m.

So, let me compute that. First, 2*C(n+1, 3) is 2*( (n+1)n(n-1)/6 ) = (n+1)n(n-1)/3.

Then, Sum_{m=2}^n m is equal to Sum_{m=1}^n m - 1 = [n(n+1)/2] - 1.

Therefore, the right-hand side is (n+1)n(n-1)/3 + [n(n+1)/2 - 1].

So, let me compute that:

First term: (n+1)n(n-1)/3.

Second term: n(n+1)/2 - 1.

So combining them:

Let me write them with common denominators. Let's compute:

First term: [n(n+1)(n-1)] / 3.

Second term: [n(n+1)/2 - 1] = [n(n+1)/2 - 1].

So total is:

[n(n+1)(n-1)/3] + [n(n+1)/2 - 1].

Let me combine the terms. Let me first combine the first two terms:

Let me factor out n(n+1):

n(n+1)[ (n - 1)/3 + 1/2 ] - 1.

Compute (n - 1)/3 + 1/2 = [2(n - 1) + 3]/6 = [2n - 2 + 3]/6 = (2n + 1)/6.

Therefore, total is n(n+1)(2n + 1)/6 - 1.

Wait, but the left-hand side is Sum_{m=2}^n m². However, the original formula for the sum of squares from 1² to n² is [n(n+1)(2n+1)]/6. Therefore, if we have Sum_{m=2}^n m² = [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6] - 1² = [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6] - 1. But according to our calculation, the right-hand side is [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6] - 1. Therefore, that would imply that Sum_{m=2}^n m² = [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6] - 1. But we need to get Sum_{m=1}^n m² = [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6]. Therefore, if we add 1² to both sides, we get:

Sum_{m=1}^n m² = [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6] - 1 + 1 = [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6]. Therefore, that's the formula. Therefore, the formula is proven.

Wait, but let me check my steps again. Because when I summed from m=2 to n, I have Sum_{m=2}^n m² = [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6] - 1. Then adding 1² gives the total sum from 1 to n. But why is that?

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the calculation. Let me check again:

Sum_{m=2}^n m² = Sum_{m=1}^n m² - 1².

So if we can show that Sum_{m=2}^n m² equals [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6] - 1, then adding 1² gives the desired formula.

But according to the calculation above, the right-hand side was equal to [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6] - 1. Therefore, that would imply that Sum_{m=2}^n m² equals that. Therefore, Sum_{m=1}^n m² equals that plus 1, which is [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6]. Therefore, that's correct.

But let me check with a small n. Let me take n=2. Then Sum_{m=2}^2 m² = 4. According to the formula, [2*3*(5)/6] - 1 = (30/6) - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4. Correct. Then adding 1² gives 5, which is 2*3*5/6 = 30/6 = 5. Correct. For n=3: Sum from 2 to 3 is 4 + 9 = 13. The formula would be [3*4*7/6] - 1 = (84/6) - 1 = 14 - 1 = 13. Correct. Then adding 1 gives 14, which is 3*4*7/6 = 14. Correct. So that seems to check out.

Therefore, part (b) is done. Now part (c): Apply the formula in part (a) to obtain a proof that 1·2 + 2·3 + ... + n(n+1) = n(n+1)(n+2)/3.

So, the problem is to prove that the sum from k=1 to n of k(k+1) equals n(n+1)(n+2)/3. Let me think. How can I relate this to part (a)?

First, note that k(k+1) is equal to 2*C(k+1, 2). Wait, let's check:

C(k+1, 2) = (k+1)k / 2. Therefore, 2*C(k+1, 2) = (k+1)k. Which is exactly k(k+1). Therefore, k(k+1) = 2*C(k+1, 2).

Therefore, the sum from k=1 to n of k(k+1) is equal to 2*sum_{k=1}^n C(k+1, 2). Let me adjust the index. Let me let m = k + 1. When k=1, m=2; when k=n, m=n+1. Therefore, the sum becomes 2*sum_{m=2}^{n+1} C(m, 2).

But from part (a), we know that sum_{m=2}^n C(m, 2) = C(n+1, 3). Therefore, sum_{m=2}^{n+1} C(m, 2) = C(n+1, 3) + C(n+1, 2). Therefore, the total sum is 2*[C(n+1, 3) + C(n+1, 2)].

Wait, but let me check. The sum from m=2 to n+1 is sum from m=2 to n plus C(n+1, 2). So yes, that's equal to C(n+1, 3) + C(n+1, 2). Therefore, the total sum is 2*[C(n+1, 3) + C(n+1, 2)].

But let me compute that. First, C(n+1, 3) + C(n+1, 2) is equal to C(n+2, 3) by Pascal's identity. Wait, because C(n+1, 3) + C(n+1, 2) = C(n+2, 3). Therefore, the total sum is 2*C(n+2, 3).

But 2*C(n+2, 3) is 2*( (n+2)(n+1)n / 6 ) = (n+2)(n+1)n / 3. Which is exactly n(n+1)(n+2)/3. Therefore, the sum from k=1 to n of k(k+1) equals n(n+1)(n+2)/3. Therefore, that's the formula.

Alternatively, let me check with n=2. The left-hand side is 1*2 + 2*3 = 2 + 6 = 8. The formula gives 2*3*4 / 3 = 24/3 = 8. Correct. For n=3: 1*2 + 2*3 + 3*4 = 2 + 6 + 12 = 20. Formula: 3*4*5 / 3 = 60/3 = 20. Correct. So that works.

Alternatively, another way to think about this is that the sum 1·2 + 2·3 + ... + n(n+1) can be related to combinations. For example, maybe considering the number of ways to choose 3 elements with some property? But the previous method using part (a) seems straightforward.

Therefore, part (c) is done.

Let me recap all parts:

(a) Proven via combinatorial argument or induction that the sum of C(k, 2) from 2 to n is C(n+1, 3).

(b) Used the identity m² = 2C(m, 2) + m, summed both sides from 2 to n, applied part (a) result, and manipulated the expressions to get the formula for the sum of squares.

(c) Expressed k(k+1) as 2C(k+1, 2), summed from 1 to n, applied part (a) result, and used Pascal's identity to get the formula for the sum of k(k+1).

Therefore, all parts are solved.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{\dbinom{n+1}{3}}

(b) \boxed{\dfrac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}}

(c) \boxed{\dfrac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{3}}

### (a) Proving the Identity:
We are to prove that for $ n \geq 2 $,
$$
\binom{2}{2} + \binom{3}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \ldots + \binom{n}{2} = \binom{n+1}{3}
$$

#### **Combinatorial Argument:**
The binomial coefficient $ \binom{k}{2} $ represents the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of $ k $ elements. The sum on the left counts the total number of 2-element subsets from all sets of size $ 2, 3, \ldots, n $.

On the right, $ \binom{n+1}{3} $ counts the number of 3-element subsets from a set of $ n+1 $ elements. Now, consider a set of $ n+1 $ elements. Fix the largest element in the 3-element subset. If the largest element is $ k $, then the other two elements must come from the first $ k-1 $ elements. The number of such subsets is $ \binom{k-1}{2} $. Summing over all possible largest elements $ k = 3 $ to $ n+1 $, we get:
$$
\sum_{k=3}^{n+1} \binom{k-1}{2} = \sum_{m=2}^{n} \binom{m}{2}
$$
which is exactly the left-hand side. Therefore,
$$
\sum_{k=2}^{n} \binom{k}{2} = \binom{n+1}{3}
$$

### (b) Deriving the Formula for the Sum of Squares:
We are given the identity:
$$
m^2 = 2\binom{m}{2} + m \quad \text{for } m \geq 2
$$
We are to use this and the result from part (a) to derive:
$$
1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
$$

#### **Summation Approach:**
Sum both sides of the identity from $ m = 2 $ to $ n $:
$$
\sum_{m=2}^n m^2 = \sum_{m=2}^n \left( 2\binom{m}{2} + m \right) = 2 \sum_{m=2}^n \binom{m}{2} + \sum_{m=2}^n m
$$

From part (a), $ \sum_{m=2}^n \binom{m}{2} = \binom{n+1}{3} $. So,
$$
\sum_{m=2}^n m^2 = 2 \binom{n+1}{3} + \sum_{m=2}^n m
$$

We also know:
$$
\sum_{m=2}^n m = \sum_{m=1}^n m - 1 = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
$$

Now, compute:
$$
2 \binom{n+1}{3} = 2 \cdot \frac{(n+1)n(n-1)}{6} = \frac{(n+1)n(n-1)}{3}
$$
$$
\sum_{m=2}^n m^2 = \frac{(n+1)n(n-1)}{3} + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
$$

To simplify:
$$
\sum_{m=2}^n m^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(n-1)}{3} + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1
$$
$$
= n(n+1)\left( \frac{n-1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \right) - 1
$$
$$
= n(n+1)\left( \frac{2(n-1) + 3}{6} \right) - 1
= n(n+1)\left( \frac{2n - 2 + 3}{6} \right) - 1
= n(n+1)\left( \frac{2n + 1}{6} \right) - 1
$$

Adding $ 1^2 = 1 $ to both sides gives:
$$
\sum_{m=1}^n m^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
$$

---

### (c) Proving the Formula for the Sum of $ k(k+1) $:
We are to prove that:
$$
1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 + \ldots + n(n+1) = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{3}
$$

#### **Using Part (a):**
Note that:
$$
k(k+1) = 2 \binom{k+1}{2}
$$
Therefore,
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n k(k+1) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{k+1}{2} = 2 \sum_{m=2}^{n+1} \binom{m}{2}
$$

From part (a), we know:
$$
\sum_{m=2}^{n+1} \binom{m}{2} = \binom{n+2}{3}
$$

So,
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n k(k+1) = 2 \binom{n+2}{3} = 2 \cdot \frac{(n+2)(n+1)n}{6} = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{3}
$$

---

### Final Answers:

**(a)**  
$$
\boxed{\binom{n+1}{3}}
$$

**(b)**  
$$
\boxed{\dfrac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}}
$$

**(c)**  
$$
\boxed{\dfrac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{3}}
$$
