Okay, so I need to prove these three statements about binomial coefficients. Let me start with part (a). The problem says that for n ≥ 1, the binomial coefficient C(n, r) is less than C(n, r+1) if and only if 0 ≤ r < (n - 1)/2. Hmm, okay. Let me recall that binomial coefficients increase up to the middle term and then decrease. So, for example, when n is even, the middle term is at n/2, and when n is odd, it's at (n-1)/2 and (n+1)/2. But here, the question is about comparing C(n, r) and C(n, r+1). 

First, maybe I should write down the ratio of consecutive binomial coefficients. Let me recall that C(n, r+1)/C(n, r) = (n - r)/(r + 1). That's because C(n, r+1) = C(n, r) * (n - r)/(r + 1). So if this ratio is greater than 1, then C(n, r+1) > C(n, r). So, setting up the inequality:

C(n, r+1)/C(n, r) > 1 ⇒ (n - r)/(r + 1) > 1 ⇒ n - r > r + 1 ⇒ n - 1 > 2r ⇒ r < (n - 1)/2.

So that's exactly the condition given in part (a). Therefore, if r is less than (n - 1)/2, then C(n, r+1) is greater than C(n, r). Conversely, if r ≥ (n - 1)/2, then the ratio is less than or equal to 1, so C(n, r+1) ≤ C(n, r). Therefore, the inequality holds if and only if 0 ≤ r < (n - 1)/2. 

But wait, the problem says "if and only if 0 ≤ r < (n - 1)/2". So I need to check if r is in that range. Also, note that r must be an integer between 0 and n. So for example, if n is even, say n = 2m, then (n - 1)/2 = (2m - 1)/2 = m - 0.5. Therefore, r must be less than m - 0.5, so the maximum integer r is m - 1. Which would make sense because the middle term is at m. So for even n, the binomial coefficients increase up to r = m - 1, then decrease. Wait, but when n is even, the middle term is at n/2. So for example, n = 4, middle term is 2. So C(4, 0) = 1, C(4, 1) = 4, C(4, 2) = 6, C(4, 3) = 4, C(4, 4) = 1. So here, C(4, r) increases up to r=2, then decreases. Therefore, for r < 1.5 (which is (4 - 1)/2 = 1.5), so r=0,1. So C(4, 1) > C(4, 0), and C(4, 2) > C(4, 1). So that seems correct. 

Similarly, for odd n. Let me take n=5. Then (n - 1)/2 = 2. So r < 2. So r=0,1. Then C(5, 1) = 5, C(5, 2) = 10. So indeed, C(5, 1) < C(5, 2). Then C(5, 2) = 10, C(5, 3) = 10, so equal. Then C(5, 3) = 10, C(5, 4) = 5. So that's correct. So the inequality holds for r < 2, which is (n - 1)/2 = 2. So that seems to check out. 

Therefore, part (a) seems to be proven by the ratio test. So I think that's the way to go. 

Now moving on to part (b): C(n, r) > C(n, r+1) if and only if n - 1 ≥ r > (n - 1)/2. Let me think. So this is the converse of part (a). So if r is greater than (n - 1)/2, then C(n, r) > C(n, r+1). Wait, but let me check with the ratio again. 

From part (a), we saw that C(n, r+1)/C(n, r) > 1 when r < (n - 1)/2. Therefore, the opposite would be when r > (n - 1)/2, then the ratio is less than 1, so C(n, r+1) < C(n, r). Therefore, C(n, r) > C(n, r+1) when r > (n - 1)/2. However, the problem says "if and only if n - 1 ≥ r > (n - 1)/2". Wait, but n - 1 ≥ r? Let me think. 

Wait, r can be at most n, but since we are talking about r+1, r must be less than n. So if r is in the range (n - 1)/2 < r < n. But the problem says "n - 1 ≥ r > (n - 1)/2". So that would be r in ((n - 1)/2, n - 1]. But let me check with n=5. For n=5, (n - 1)/2 = 2. So r > 2, so r=3,4. Then C(5,3)=10, C(5,4)=5, so 10 > 5. Similarly, C(5,4)=5, C(5,5)=1. So that's correct. 

But what about r = n - 1? For example, n=5, r=4. Then C(5,4)=5, and C(5,5)=1. So indeed, 5 > 1. So for r = n - 1, which is greater than (n - 1)/2 (since n - 1 > (n - 1)/2 for n ≥ 2). Therefore, the condition is r > (n - 1)/2 and r ≤ n - 1. But why does the problem say "n - 1 ≥ r"? Because r can't be greater than n - 1, since r+1 would be n, which is valid. So the range is r in ((n - 1)/2, n - 1]. Therefore, the problem says "n - 1 ≥ r > (n - 1)/2", which is the same as r ∈ ((n - 1)/2, n - 1]. So that seems correct. 

But wait, what about when n is even? Let's take n=4. Then (n - 1)/2 = 1.5. So r > 1.5 and r ≤ 3. So r=2,3. For r=2, C(4,2)=6, C(4,3)=4, so 6 > 4. For r=3, C(4,3)=4, C(4,4)=1, so 4 > 1. So that's correct. So in this case, the condition is r > 1.5 and r ≤ 3. So for r=2,3. 

But in the problem statement, part (b) says "if and only if n - 1 ≥ r > (n - 1)/2". So that's exactly the case. Therefore, this seems to be correct. 

But let me check for n=1. Wait, n ≥ 1. For n=1, (n - 1)/2 = 0. So the condition is r > 0 and r ≤ 0. Which is impossible. But for n=1, the binomial coefficients are C(1,0)=1 and C(1,1)=1. So C(1,0) = C(1,1). So the inequality C(n, r) > C(n, r+1) would never hold. Therefore, the condition is vacuously true? Or maybe for n=1, there is no r such that n - 1 ≥ r > (n - 1)/2. Since n - 1 = 0, and (n - 1)/2 = 0. So r > 0 and r ≤ 0, which is impossible. Therefore, the statement is vacuously true. 

But maybe the problem assumes n ≥ 2? Wait, the problem says n ≥ 1. So maybe for n=1, the statement is trivially true. 

Therefore, part (b) seems to be correct. 

Now part (c): C(n, r) = C(n, r+1) if and only if n is odd and r = (n - 1)/2. 

So, when does C(n, r) = C(n, r+1)? From part (a) and (b), we know that equality occurs when the ratio is 1. So, setting (n - r)/(r + 1) = 1. Therefore, n - r = r + 1 ⇒ n - 1 = 2r ⇒ r = (n - 1)/2. 

Therefore, this is the condition. But for this to be an integer, (n - 1)/2 must be an integer. Therefore, n - 1 must be even, so n must be odd. 

Therefore, if n is odd, then (n - 1)/2 is an integer, so r = (n - 1)/2 is an integer, and then C(n, r) = C(n, r+1). 

But if n is even, then (n - 1)/2 is not an integer. For example, n=4, (n - 1)/2 = 1.5. So r would have to be 1.5, which is not an integer, so there is no integer r such that C(n, r) = C(n, r+1). 

But wait, for even n, there is a middle term. For example, n=4, the middle terms are at r=2 and r=2 (since n is even, the middle is at n/2). Wait, C(4, 2) = 6, and C(4, 3) = 4. So they are not equal. Similarly, for n=6, C(6, 3) = 20, C(6, 4) = 15. Not equal. So indeed, for even n, there is no r such that C(n, r) = C(n, r+1). 

But for odd n, say n=5, then (n - 1)/2 = 2. So r=2, then C(5, 2)=10, C(5, 3)=10. So they are equal. Similarly, n=3: (n - 1)/2 = 1. So C(3,1)=3, C(3,2)=3. So they are equal. 

Therefore, the equality occurs if and only if n is odd and r=(n - 1)/2. 

Therefore, part (c) is proven by the same ratio test. 

But let me check if there are other cases where C(n, r) = C(n, r+1). For example, if n=2, r=0: C(2,0)=1, C(2,1)=2. Not equal. For n=1, C(1,0)=1, C(1,1)=1. So here, n=1 is odd, and r=(1 - 1)/2 = 0. So r=0. Indeed, C(1,0)=C(1,1)=1. So that works. 

But for n=1, r=0, which is (n - 1)/2 = 0. So that is correct. 

So in general, for n odd, r=(n - 1)/2 is an integer, and C(n, r) = C(n, r+1). For even n, there is no such integer r. Therefore, part (c) is correct. 

So putting it all together, the three parts are all proven by analyzing the ratio of consecutive binomial coefficients. 

Let me just check if there's any edge cases I might have missed. For example, when n=1, part (a): 0 ≤ r < (1 - 1)/2 = 0. So r < 0. But r must be ≥ 0, so no solutions. Which is correct, because for n=1, C(1,0)=1 and C(1,1)=1. So C(1,0) is not less than C(1,1). So the condition is vacuously true. 

Similarly, part (b) for n=1: n - 1 ≥ r > (n - 1)/2 ⇒ 0 ≥ r > 0. Which is impossible, so again, the condition is vacuously true. 

For part (c), n=1 is odd, and r=(1 - 1)/2=0, so C(1,0)=C(1,1). Correct. 

Another example: n=2. For part (a): 0 ≤ r < (2 - 1)/2 = 0.5. So r=0. Then check if C(2,0) < C(2,1). Yes, 1 < 2. So that's correct. 

For part (b): n - 1 ≥ r > (n - 1)/2 ⇒ 1 ≥ r > 0.5. So r=1. Check C(2,1) > C(2,2). 2 > 1, correct. 

For part (c): n=2 is even, so no equality. Correct. 

Another example, n=3. Part (a): 0 ≤ r < (3 - 1)/2 = 1. So r=0. Check C(3,0)=1 < C(3,1)=3. Correct. 

Part (b): n - 1 ≥ r > (n - 1)/2 ⇒ 2 ≥ r > 1. So r=2. Check C(3,2)=3 > C(3,3)=1. Correct. 

Part (c): n=3 is odd, r=(3 - 1)/2=1. Check C(3,1)=3 and C(3,2)=3. Correct. 

Therefore, all the test cases check out. 

So I think that's the reasoning. Therefore, all three parts are proven by analyzing the ratio between consecutive binomial coefficients and solving the inequality.

**Final Answer**

(a) $\boxed{0 \leq r < \frac{1}{2}(n - 1)}$

(b) $\boxed{n - 1 \geq r > \frac{1}{2}(n - 1)}$

(c) $\boxed{n \text{ is odd and } r = \frac{1}{2}(n - 1)}$

To analyze the behavior of binomial coefficients, we begin by considering the ratio of consecutive binomial coefficients:

$$
\frac{\binom{n}{r+1}}{\binom{n}{r}} = \frac{n - r}{r + 1}
$$

This ratio determines whether the binomial coefficient increases or decreases as $ r $ increases.

### **(a) $\binom{n}{r} < \binom{n}{r+1}$ if and only if $0 \leq r < \frac{1}{2}(n - 1)$**

We want to find when:

$$
\frac{n - r}{r + 1} > 1 \Rightarrow n - r > r + 1 \Rightarrow n - 1 > 2r \Rightarrow r < \frac{n - 1}{2}
$$

So the inequality $\binom{n}{r} < \binom{n}{r+1}$ holds **if and only if** $0 \leq r < \frac{1}{2}(n - 1)$. This is because the binomial coefficients increase up to the middle of the row, and then decrease.

---

### **(b) $\binom{n}{r} > \binom{n}{r+1}$ if and only if $n - 1 \geq r > \frac{1}{2}(n - 1)$**

Using the same ratio:

$$
\frac{n - r}{r + 1} < 1 \Rightarrow n - r < r + 1 \Rightarrow n - 1 < 2r \Rightarrow r > \frac{n - 1}{2}
$$

However, we must also ensure that $r+1 \leq n$, i.e., $r \leq n - 1$. Therefore, the condition becomes:

$$
n - 1 \geq r > \frac{n - 1}{2}
$$

This means the binomial coefficients decrease when $r$ is in this range.

---

### **(c) $\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{r+1}$ if and only if $n$ is odd and $r = \frac{1}{2}(n - 1)$**

For the binomial coefficients to be equal:

$$
\frac{n - r}{r + 1} = 1 \Rightarrow n - r = r + 1 \Rightarrow n - 1 = 2r \Rightarrow r = \frac{n - 1}{2}
$$

This is only an integer when $n - 1$ is even, i.e., when $n$ is odd. Therefore, $\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{r+1}$ **if and only if** $n$ is odd and $r = \frac{1}{2}(n - 1)$.

---

### Final Answers

**(a)** $\boxed{0 \leq r < \frac{1}{2}(n - 1)}$

**(b)** $\boxed{n - 1 \geq r > \frac{1}{2}(n - 1)}$

**(c)** $\boxed{n \text{ is odd and } r = \frac{1}{2}(n - 1)}$
