Okay, so I need to verify that the sum of the squares of the first n odd numbers is equal to the binomial coefficient (2n+1 choose 3). Let me start by recalling what the binomial coefficient means. The binomial coefficient $\binom{2n+1}{3}$ is calculated as $\frac{(2n+1)(2n)(2n-1)}{6}$. So, if I can show that the sum $1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + \ldots + (2n-1)^2$ simplifies to that expression, then I can verify the equation.

First, let me write out the sum explicitly. The sum is:

$1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + \ldots + (2n-1)^2$.

I know that the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers is $\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$. But here, we are dealing with the sum of squares of odd numbers only. Maybe I can relate this sum to the sum of squares of all numbers and subtract the even ones?

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula specifically for the sum of squares of odd numbers. Let me think. Let me try to derive it.

Let me denote the sum as S:

$S = 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + \ldots + (2n-1)^2$.

I can note that the odd numbers are the numbers of the form 2k - 1 where k ranges from 1 to n. So, substituting that in:

$S = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1)^2$.

Expanding the square:

$(2k - 1)^2 = 4k^2 - 4k + 1$.

Therefore, the sum becomes:

$S = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (4k^2 - 4k + 1) = 4\sum_{k=1}^{n}k^2 - 4\sum_{k=1}^{n}k + \sum_{k=1}^{n}1$.

Now, I can use the standard formulas for these sums. The sum of the first n squares is $\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$, the sum of the first n natural numbers is $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, and the sum of 1 n times is just n.

Substituting these into the expression:

$S = 4\left(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\right) - 4\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right) + n$.

Let me simplify each term step by step.

First term: $4 \times \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$. Let me simplify the coefficients:

4 divided by 6 is 2/3, so:

$\frac{2}{3}n(n+1)(2n+1)$.

Second term: $-4 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. 4 divided by 2 is 2, so:

$-2n(n+1)$.

Third term: +n.

So combining all together:

$S = \frac{2}{3}n(n+1)(2n+1) - 2n(n+1) + n$.

Now, let me factor out common terms. Let's first compute the first two terms:

Let me factor out 2n(n+1) from the first two terms. Wait, the first term is $\frac{2}{3}n(n+1)(2n+1)$ and the second term is -2n(n+1). Let me write them as:

$\frac{2}{3}n(n+1)(2n+1) - 2n(n+1) = n(n+1)\left( \frac{2}{3}(2n + 1) - 2 \right)$.

Let me compute the expression inside the parentheses:

$\frac{2}{3}(2n + 1) - 2 = \frac{4n + 2}{3} - \frac{6}{3} = \frac{4n + 2 - 6}{3} = \frac{4n - 4}{3} = \frac{4(n - 1)}{3}$.

Therefore, the first two terms combined become:

$n(n+1) \times \frac{4(n - 1)}{3} = \frac{4n(n+1)(n - 1)}{3}$.

Now, adding the third term, which is +n, so:

$S = \frac{4n(n+1)(n - 1)}{3} + n$.

Let me combine these terms. To do that, I need a common denominator. Let me write n as $\frac{3n}{3}$:

$S = \frac{4n(n+1)(n - 1) + 3n}{3}$.

Factor out n from the numerator:

$S = \frac{n[4(n+1)(n - 1) + 3]}{3}$.

Now, compute the expression inside the brackets:

First, compute $4(n+1)(n - 1)$. Note that (n+1)(n - 1) is $n^2 - 1$, so:

$4(n^2 - 1) + 3 = 4n^2 - 4 + 3 = 4n^2 - 1$.

Therefore, the numerator becomes:

$n(4n^2 - 1)$, so:

$S = \frac{n(4n^2 - 1)}{3}$.

Hmm, so that's the expression for S. Let me check if this is equal to $\binom{2n + 1}{3}$.

First, let's compute $\binom{2n + 1}{3}$:

$\binom{2n + 1}{3} = \frac{(2n + 1)(2n)(2n - 1)}{6}$.

So, let me compute this:

Multiply out the numerator:

(2n + 1)(2n)(2n - 1). Let me compute (2n + 1)(2n - 1) first, which is a difference of squares: (2n)^2 - 1^2 = 4n² - 1. Then multiply by 2n:

(4n² - 1)(2n) = 8n³ - 2n.

Therefore, $\binom{2n + 1}{3} = \frac{8n³ - 2n}{6} = \frac{4n³ - n}{3}$.

So, $\binom{2n + 1}{3} = \frac{4n³ - n}{3}$.

Now, let me compare with the expression I obtained for S:

S = $\frac{n(4n² - 1)}{3} = \frac{4n³ - n}{3}$, which is exactly the same as $\binom{2n + 1}{3}$. Therefore, they are equal. Therefore, the original statement is verified.

Wait, but let me check with a small value of n to make sure.

Take n = 1: Left side is 1² = 1. Right side is $\binom{3}{3} = 1$. Okay, works.

n = 2: Left side is 1 + 9 = 10. Right side is $\binom{5}{3} = 10$. Correct.

n = 3: Left side is 1 + 9 + 25 = 35. Right side is $\binom{7}{3} = 35$. Correct.

n = 4: 1 + 9 + 25 + 49 = 84. $\binom{9}{3} = 84$. Correct. So seems correct.

Therefore, the derivation is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there is another way to see this? Maybe using combinatorial arguments?

But since the algebra checks out, and the test cases work, I think this is correct.

So, the key steps were expanding the sum of squares of odd numbers, breaking it into standard sums, simplifying, and then showing that it equals the binomial coefficient. The crucial part was expanding the square and then simplifying the resulting expression, which eventually led to the same expression as the binomial coefficient.

Therefore, the identity is verified.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\binom{2n+1}{3}}
</think>

To verify the identity:

$$
1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + \ldots + (2n-1)^2 = \binom{2n+1}{3}
$$

we begin by expressing the left-hand side as a summation. The sequence consists of the squares of the first $ n $ odd numbers, which can be written as:

$$
S = \sum_{k=1}^n (2k - 1)^2
$$

---

### Step 1: Expand the Square

Expanding $ (2k - 1)^2 $:

$$
(2k - 1)^2 = 4k^2 - 4k + 1
$$

So the sum becomes:

$$
S = \sum_{k=1}^n (4k^2 - 4k + 1) = 4\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 - 4\sum_{k=1}^n k + \sum_{k=1}^n 1
$$

---

### Step 2: Use Known Summation Formulas

We apply the standard formulas:

- $ \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} $
- $ \sum_{k=1}^n k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $
- $ \sum_{k=1}^n 1 = n $

Substituting these into the expression:

$$
S = 4 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 4 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n
$$

Simplify each term:

- First term: $ \frac{2}{3} n(n+1)(2n+1) $
- Second term: $ -2n(n+1) $
- Third term: $ n $

Combining:

$$
S = \frac{2}{3}n(n+1)(2n+1) - 2n(n+1) + n
$$

---

### Step 3: Combine and Simplify

Factor out $ n(n+1) $ from the first two terms:

$$
S = n(n+1)\left( \frac{2}{3}(2n+1) - 2 \right) + n
$$

Compute the expression inside the parentheses:

$$
\frac{2}{3}(2n+1) - 2 = \frac{4n + 2 - 6}{3} = \frac{4n - 4}{3} = \frac{4(n - 1)}{3}
$$

So now:

$$
S = n(n+1) \cdot \frac{4(n - 1)}{3} + n = \frac{4n(n+1)(n - 1)}{3} + n
$$

Write $ n $ as $ \frac{3n}{3} $ to get a common denominator:

$$
S = \frac{4n(n+1)(n - 1) + 3n}{3}
$$

Factor out $ n $:

$$
S = \frac{n[4(n+1)(n - 1) + 3]}{3}
$$

Compute the expression in the brackets:

$$
4(n^2 - 1) + 3 = 4n^2 - 4 + 3 = 4n^2 - 1
$$

So:

$$
S = \frac{n(4n^2 - 1)}{3} = \frac{4n^3 - n}{3}
$$

---

### Step 4: Compare with the Binomial Coefficient

Now compute $ \binom{2n+1}{3} $:

$$
\binom{2n+1}{3} = \frac{(2n+1)(2n)(2n-1)}{6}
$$

Multiply the numerator:

$$
(2n+1)(2n)(2n-1) = (2n+1)(4n^2 - 2n) = 8n^3 - 4n^2 + 4n^2 - 2n = 8n^3 - 2n
$$

So:

$$
\binom{2n+1}{3} = \frac{8n^3 - 2n}{6} = \frac{4n^3 - n}{3}
$$

Which matches the expression we derived for $ S $.

---

### Final Verification

Thus, we have shown that:

$$
1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + \ldots + (2n-1)^2 = \frac{4n^3 - n}{3} = \binom{2n+1}{3}
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\binom{2n+1}{3}}
$$
