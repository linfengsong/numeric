Okay, let me try to work through these binomial coefficient identities one by one. Starting with part (a). The problem says to derive that the sum of binomial coefficients from k=0 to n is 2^n. The hint suggests using the binomial theorem with a = b = 1. 

Alright, the binomial theorem states that (a + b)^n = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) a^{n-k} b^k. If I set a = 1 and b = 1, then (1 + 1)^n = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) 1^{n-k} 1^k. Simplifying that, it's 2^n = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k). So that's exactly the identity given in part (a). Therefore, part (a) is straightforward using the binomial theorem. I think that's it for part (a).

Moving on to part (b): the alternating sum of binomial coefficients equals zero. The hint says to use the binomial theorem again, but maybe with a = 1 and b = -1? Let me check. If I set a = 1 and b = -1, then (1 - 1)^n = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) 1^{n - k} (-1)^k. Which simplifies to 0^n = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) (-1)^k. But 0^n is 0 for n ≥ 1, so that gives the alternating sum equals zero. That's exactly part (b). So that's done.

Part (c): the sum from k=1 to n of k*C(n, k) equals n*2^{n-1}. Hmm. How do I approach this? I remember that there's a formula for the sum of k*C(n, k). Maybe using the binomial theorem again? Let me think. Let's recall that the derivative of (1 + x)^n is n*(1 + x)^{n - 1} = sum_{k=0}^n k*C(n, k) x^{k - 1}. If I multiply both sides by x, I get n*x*(1 + x)^{n - 1} = sum_{k=0}^n k*C(n, k) x^k. Then, setting x = 1, we get n*1*(1 + 1)^{n - 1} = sum_{k=0}^n k*C(n, k)*1^k. Which simplifies to n*2^{n - 1} = sum_{k=0}^n k*C(n, k). But since the term when k=0 is 0, this is equal to the sum from k=1 to n. Therefore, that gives the desired result. So part (c) is done by differentiation. Alternatively, maybe there's another way, but this seems solid.

Part (d): the sum from k=0 to n of 2^k*C(n, k) equals 3^n. Again, binomial theorem? Let me check. The binomial theorem says that (a + b)^n = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) a^{n - k} b^k. If I set a = 2 and b = 1, then (2 + 1)^n = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) 2^{n - k} 1^k = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) 2^{n - k}. But that's not exactly the same as the given sum. Wait, the given sum is sum_{k=0}^n 2^k*C(n, k). So if I set a = 1 and b = 2, then (1 + 2)^n = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) 1^{n - k} 2^k = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) 2^k. Which is exactly the sum in part (d). Therefore, that equals 3^n. So part (d) is straightforward using the binomial theorem with a = 1 and b = 2.

Part (e): The sum of even binomial coefficients equals the sum of odd binomial coefficients, both equal to 2^{n-1}. Wait, the problem states that the sum of even binomial coefficients (C(n, 0) + C(n, 2) + ...) equals the sum of odd binomial coefficients (C(n, 1) + C(n, 3) + ...), and both equal 2^{n-1}. How to show this?

One approach is to use the binomial theorem with a = 1 and b = -1. Let me recall that (1 + 1)^n = 2^n = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) and (1 - 1)^n = 0 = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) (-1)^k. If we add these two equations: 2^n + 0 = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) [1 + (-1)^k]. The right-hand side is 2*sum_{even k} C(n, k). Therefore, 2^n = 2*sum_{even k} C(n, k), so sum_{even k} C(n, k) = 2^{n - 1}. Similarly, subtracting the two equations: 2^n - 0 = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) [1 - (-1)^k]. The right-hand side is 2*sum_{odd k} C(n, k). Therefore, 2^n = 2*sum_{odd k} C(n, k), so sum_{odd k} C(n, k) = 2^{n - 1}. Hence, both sums are equal to 2^{n - 1}. Therefore, part (e) is done.

But wait, the problem statement in part (e) says that the sum of even binomial coefficients equals the sum of odd binomial coefficients, both equal to 2^{n-1}. So that's exactly what we just showed. So that's part (e).

Part (f): This one looks more complicated. The sum is from k=0 to n of [(-1)^k / (k + 1)] * C(n, k) equals 1/(n + 1). Hmm. How to approach this? Let me think.

First, maybe consider integrating the binomial theorem. Let me recall that integrating (1 + x)^n term by term. Let's see. Let me consider the integral of (1 + x)^n dx from 0 to 1. Let's compute that. The integral is [ (1 + x)^{n + 1} / (n + 1) ) ] from 0 to 1, which is [2^{n + 1} / (n + 1) - 1^{n + 1}/(n + 1)] = (2^{n + 1} - 1)/(n + 1).

On the other hand, expanding (1 + x)^n as sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) x^k, then integrating term by term from 0 to 1 gives sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) * [x^{k + 1}/(k + 1)] from 0 to 1, which is sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k)/(k + 1). Therefore, we have:

sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k)/(k + 1) = (2^{n + 1} - 1)/(n + 1).

But the problem is sum_{k=0}^n [(-1)^k / (k + 1)] C(n, k). So maybe instead of integrating (1 + x)^n, integrate (1 - x)^n?

Let me try that. Let's compute the integral of (1 - x)^n dx from 0 to 1. Let me compute that. Let me make substitution. Let me expand (1 - x)^n as sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) (-1)^k x^k. Then integrating term by term from 0 to 1:

sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) (-1)^k [x^{k + 1}/(k + 1)] from 0 to 1 = sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) (-1)^k / (k + 1).

Which is exactly the sum in part (f). So let's compute the integral of (1 - x)^n dx from 0 to 1. Let me compute that integral directly. Let me make substitution u = 1 - x, then du = -dx. When x = 0, u = 1; x = 1, u = 0. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫_{u=1}^{0} u^n (-du) = ∫_{0}^{1} u^n du = [u^{n + 1}/(n + 1)] from 0 to 1 = 1/(n + 1).

Therefore, the integral equals 1/(n + 1), which is equal to the sum in part (f). Therefore, the sum is 1/(n + 1). Therefore, part (f) is done.

Let me check if there's another way. Alternatively, maybe using generating functions or combinatorial arguments, but the integral approach seems solid here.

So summarizing all parts:

(a) Using binomial theorem with a = 1, b = 1.

(b) Using binomial theorem with a = 1, b = -1.

(c) Differentiating the binomial theorem and evaluating at x = 1.

(d) Using binomial theorem with a = 1, b = 2.

(e) Using binomial theorem with a = 1, b = -1 and adding/subtracting equations.

(f) Integrating the binomial theorem with a = 1, b = -1.

All parts seem to be covered with these methods. Let me just check for any possible mistakes.

For part (c), when I took the derivative, I had (1 + x)^n derivative is n(1 + x)^{n - 1} = sum_{k=0}^n k C(n, k) x^{k - 1}. Then multiplying by x gives n x (1 + x)^{n - 1} = sum_{k=0}^n k C(n, k) x^k. Then setting x = 1 gives n * 1 * 2^{n - 1} = sum_{k=0}^n k C(n, k). Since the term at k=0 is 0, that's equal to the sum from k=1 to n. So that's correct.

For part (f), the integral approach is correct. The integral of (1 - x)^n from 0 to 1 is indeed 1/(n + 1). Therefore, the sum equals 1/(n + 1). That seems correct.

Therefore, all parts are derived correctly. I think that's all.

**Final Answer**

(a) $\boxed{2^n}$

(b) $\boxed{0}$

(c) $\boxed{n2^{n-1}}$

(d) $\boxed{3^n}$

(e) $\boxed{2^{n-1}}$

(f) $\boxed{\dfrac{1}{n+1}}$

To derive the given binomial identities, we use the **binomial theorem**, **calculus**, and **algebraic manipulation** as appropriate. Here's a step-by-step breakdown for each part:

---

### **(a)**  
We are to show that  
$$
\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{2} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n} = 2^n
$$  
**Proof using the binomial theorem:**  
Recall the binomial theorem:  
$$
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
$$  
Set $ a = 1 $, $ b = 1 $:  
$$
(1 + 1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 2^n
$$  
Thus, the identity is proven.

**Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{2^n}
$$

---

### **(b)**  
We are to show that  
$$
\binom{n}{0} - \binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{2} - \ldots + (-1)^n \binom{n}{n} = 0
$$  
**Proof using the binomial theorem:**  
Again, use the binomial theorem with $ a = 1 $, $ b = -1 $:  
$$
(1 - 1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (-1)^k = 0^n = 0
$$  
Thus, the identity is proven.

**Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{0}
$$

---

### **(c)**  
We are to show that  
$$
\binom{n}{1} + 2\binom{n}{2} + 3\binom{n}{3} + \ldots + n\binom{n}{n} = n2^{n-1}
$$  
**Proof using differentiation:**  
Start with the binomial expansion:  
$$
(1 + x)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k
$$  
Differentiate both sides:  
$$
n(1 + x)^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^n k \binom{n}{k} x^{k-1}
$$  
Multiply both sides by $ x $:  
$$
nx(1 + x)^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^n k \binom{n}{k} x^k
$$  
Set $ x = 1 $:  
$$
n \cdot 1 \cdot 2^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^n k \binom{n}{k}
$$  
Since the term at $ k = 0 $ is zero, this is equal to the sum from $ k = 1 $ to $ n $, so  
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n k \binom{n}{k} = n2^{n-1}
$$

**Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{n2^{n-1}}
$$

---

### **(d)**  
We are to show that  
$$
\binom{n}{0} + 2\binom{n}{1} + 2^2\binom{n}{2} + \ldots + 2^n\binom{n}{n} = 3^n
$$  
**Proof using the binomial theorem:**  
Use the binomial theorem with $ a = 1 $, $ b = 2 $:  
$$
(1 + 2)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} 2^k = 3^n
$$  
Thus, the identity is proven.

**Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{3^n}
$$

---

### **(e)**  
We are to show that the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients equals the sum of odd-indexed binomial coefficients, both equal to $ 2^{n-1} $.  
**Proof using binomial theorem with alternating signs:**  
Use the binomial theorem with $ a = 1 $, $ b = -1 $:  
$$
(1 + 1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 2^n \\
(1 - 1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (-1)^k = 0
$$  
Add the two equations:  
$$
2^n + 0 = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (1 + (-1)^k)
$$  
This gives $ 2 \sum_{\text{even } k} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n $, so  
$$
\sum_{\text{even } k} \binom{n}{k} = 2^{n-1}
$$  
Similarly, subtract the equations:  
$$
2^n - 0 = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (1 - (-1)^k)
$$  
This gives $ 2 \sum_{\text{odd } k} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n $, so  
$$
\sum_{\text{odd } k} \binom{n}{k} = 2^{n-1}
$$

**Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{2^{n-1}}
$$

---

### **(f)**  
We are to show that  
$$
\binom{n}{0} - \frac{1}{2}\binom{n}{1} + \frac{1}{3}\binom{n}{2} - \ldots + \frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}\binom{n}{n} = \frac{1}{n+1}
$$  
**Proof using integration:**  
Start with the binomial expansion:  
$$
(1 + x)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k
$$  
Integrate both sides from $ x = 0 $ to $ x = 1 $:  
$$
\int_0^1 (1 + x)^n dx = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \int_0^1 x^k dx = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{\binom{n}{k}}{k+1}
$$  
Compute the integral:  
$$
\int_0^1 (1 + x)^n dx = \left[ \frac{(1 + x)^{n+1}}{n+1} \right]_0^1 = \frac{2^{n+1} - 1}{n+1}
$$  
Now consider the alternating sum:  
$$
\int_0^1 (1 - x)^n dx = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (-1)^k \int_0^1 x^k dx = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{(-1)^k \binom{n}{k}}{k+1}
$$  
Compute the integral:  
$$
\int_0^1 (1 - x)^n dx = \int_0^1 u^n du = \frac{1}{n+1}
$$  
Thus, the alternating sum equals $ \frac{1}{n+1} $.

**Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{n+1}}
$$
