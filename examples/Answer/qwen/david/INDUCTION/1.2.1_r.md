Okay, so I need to derive Newton's identity for part (a), which is the equation involving binomial coefficients: 

$$\binom{n}{k}\binom{k}{r}=\binom{n}{r}\binom{n-r}{k-r}$$

And then use that to express $\binom{n}{k}$ in terms of $\binom{n}{k-1}$ for part (b). Let me start with part (a).

First, I remember that binomial coefficients can be interpreted in terms of combinations. The left-hand side (LHS) is $\binom{n}{k}$ multiplied by $\binom{k}{r}$. The right-hand side (RHS) is $\binom{n}{r}$ multiplied by $\binom{n - r}{k - r}$. 

Maybe I can think combinatorially. Suppose I have a set of n elements. The first binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ is choosing k elements out of n. Then, from those k elements, I choose r elements, which is $\binom{k}{r}$. So overall, this would be choosing a subset of size k, and then choosing a subset of size r from that subset. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to count the same thing?

On the RHS, $\binom{n}{r}$ is choosing r elements from n, and then $\binom{n - r}{k - r}$ is choosing k - r elements from the remaining n - r elements. So, this would be choosing r elements first, then choosing k - r elements from the rest. 

So, if I think of the LHS as first choosing k elements, then choosing r elements from those k, and the RHS as choosing r elements first, then choosing k - r elements from the remaining. These should count the same thing, so the two expressions should be equal. 

But how do I formalize this into an identity? Maybe using the definition of binomial coefficients. Let me write out the definitions.

The binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ is $\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}$, and similarly for others. Let me compute both sides.

Starting with LHS: $\binom{n}{k} \times \binom{k}{r} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \times \frac{k!}{r!(k - r)!}$. 

Simplifying that, the k! cancels out:

= $\frac{n!}{(n - k)!} \times \frac{1}{r!(k - r)!}$

= $\frac{n!}{r!(k - r)!(n - k)!}$

Now, let's compute the RHS: $\binom{n}{r} \times \binom{n - r}{k - r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} \times \frac{(n - r)!}{(k - r)!(n - r - (k - r))!}$

Simplify the second term: denominator is (k - r)! times (n - r - k + r)! = (k - r)! times (n - k)!.

So, RHS becomes:

= $\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} \times \frac{(n - r)!}{(k - r)!(n - k)!}$

Again, the (n - r)! cancels out:

= $\frac{n!}{r!(k - r)!(n - k)!}$

Which is exactly the same as the LHS. Therefore, the identity holds. 

So that's part (a). But maybe I need to explain it more combinatorially? The problem says "derive Newton's identity," so maybe they want a combinatorial proof? But the algebraic proof is straightforward. However, maybe the question expects a different approach?

Alternatively, maybe using Pascal's identity or some recursive formula? But since the algebra checks out, maybe that's sufficient. Let me check if the algebra is correct.

Yes, the LHS simplifies to n! divided by [r! (k - r)! (n - k)!], and the RHS also simplifies to the same. Therefore, they are equal. So that's the derivation.

Now, moving on to part (b). We need to express $\binom{n}{k}$ in terms of $\binom{n}{k - 1}$ using the identity from part (a). 

The given formula is:

$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n - k + 1}{k} \binom{n}{k - 1}$$

So, how do I get there? Maybe using the identity from part (a). Let me think.

Let me try to set specific values for n, k, r in part (a)'s identity to relate $\binom{n}{k}$ to $\binom{n}{k - 1}$. 

Let me see. Let me take r = k - 1. Wait, if I set r = k - 1, then let's plug into the identity:

Left-hand side: $\binom{n}{k} \times \binom{k}{k - 1}$. 

Right-hand side: $\binom{n}{k - 1} \times \binom{n - (k - 1)}{k - (k - 1)} = \binom{n}{k - 1} \times \binom{n - k + 1}{1}$

So let's compute both sides.

Left-hand side: $\binom{n}{k} \times \binom{k}{k - 1}$. 

But $\binom{k}{k - 1} = k$, since it's choosing k - 1 elements from k, which is k.

Therefore, LHS is $\binom{n}{k} \times k$.

RHS is $\binom{n}{k - 1} \times (n - k + 1)$, since $\binom{n - k + 1}{1} = n - k + 1$.

Therefore, we have:

$\binom{n}{k} \times k = \binom{n}{k - 1} \times (n - k + 1)$

Therefore, solving for $\binom{n}{k}$:

$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n - k + 1}{k} \binom{n}{k - 1}$

Which is exactly the formula given in part (b). 

Therefore, using part (a) with r = k - 1 gives us the desired expression. 

Alternatively, maybe another approach? Let me check if that's the only way. 

Alternatively, using the formula from part (a) with different parameters. But I think this is the right way. 

Let me verify with a small example. Let's take n = 5, k = 2, r = 1. 

Left-hand side: $\binom{5}{2} \times \binom{2}{1} = 10 \times 2 = 20$.

Right-hand side: $\binom{5}{1} \times \binom{5 - 1}{2 - 1} = 5 \times \binom{4}{1} = 5 \times 4 = 20$. So that works.

For part (b), let me take n = 5, k = 2. Then according to the formula:

$\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 - 2 + 1}{2} \times \binom{5}{1}$ => 10 = (4/2) * 5 => 10 = 2 * 5 = 10. Correct.

Another example: n = 4, k = 3. Then:

$\binom{4}{3} = \frac{4 - 3 + 1}{3} \times \binom{4}{2}$ => 4 = (2/3)*6 => 4 = 4. Correct.

So the formula works. Therefore, part (b) is derived using part (a) by setting r = k - 1.

Therefore, both parts are done.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{\binom{n}{k}\binom{k}{r}=\binom{n}{r}\binom{n-r}{k-r}}

(b) \boxed{\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n - k + 1}{k}\binom{n}{k - 1}}

To solve the given problem, we proceed in two parts, each building upon the combinatorial identities and algebraic manipulation of binomial coefficients.

### **Part (a): Deriving Newton's Identity**

We are asked to prove the identity:

$$
\binom{n}{k} \binom{k}{r} = \binom{n}{r} \binom{n - r}{k - r}
$$

**Step 1: Use the definition of binomial coefficients**

Recall the definition of a binomial coefficient:

$$
\binom{a}{b} = \frac{a!}{b!(a - b)!}
$$

Apply this to both sides of the identity:

**Left-Hand Side (LHS):**

$$
\binom{n}{k} \binom{k}{r} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \cdot \frac{k!}{r!(k - r)!} = \frac{n!}{r!(k - r)!(n - k)!}
$$

**Right-Hand Side (RHS):**

$$
\binom{n}{r} \binom{n - r}{k - r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} \cdot \frac{(n - r)!}{(k - r)!(n - k)!} = \frac{n!}{r!(k - r)!(n - k)!}
$$

Both sides are equal, so the identity holds.

### **Part (b): Expressing $\binom{n}{k}$ in terms of $\binom{n}{k - 1}$**

We are given the identity from part (a), and we are to use it to derive:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n - k + 1}{k} \binom{n}{k - 1}
$$

**Step 1: Choose specific values for $r$ in part (a)**

Let us set $r = k - 1$. Then the identity becomes:

$$
\binom{n}{k} \binom{k}{k - 1} = \binom{n}{k - 1} \binom{n - (k - 1)}{k - (k - 1)}
$$

Simplify each term:

- $\binom{k}{k - 1} = k$
- $\binom{n - (k - 1)}{k - (k - 1)} = \binom{n - k + 1}{1} = n - k + 1$

So the identity becomes:

$$
\binom{n}{k} \cdot k = \binom{n}{k - 1} \cdot (n - k + 1)
$$

**Step 2: Solve for $\binom{n}{k}$**

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n - k + 1}{k} \binom{n}{k - 1}
$$

This is the desired expression.

---

### **Final Answers**

(a) $\boxed{\binom{n}{k}\binom{k}{r}=\binom{n}{r}\binom{n-r}{k-r}}$

(b) $\boxed{\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n - k + 1}{k}\binom{n}{k - 1}}$
