Okay, so I need to show that the sum of a geometric series, which is a + ar + ar² + ... + arⁿ, equals (a(r^{n+1} - 1))/(r - 1) when r is not equal to 1. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a geometric series is a series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. In this case, the first term is 'a' and the common ratio is 'r'. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is something I've heard about before, but I need to derive it step by step.

Let me denote the sum as S. So,

S = a + ar + ar² + ar³ + ... + arⁿ.

Since there are (n + 1) terms here, right? Because starting from exponent 0 up to exponent n, that's n + 1 terms. But maybe I should check that. If n is 0, then it's just a, which is one term. If n is 1, then it's a + ar, two terms. So yes, n + 1 terms.

Now, the standard formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a(1 - r^{n+1})/(1 - r) when r ≠ 1. Wait, but the problem says (a(r^{n+1} - 1))/(r - 1). Let me see if these are the same. If I factor out a negative sign from the numerator and denominator, then:

a(1 - r^{n+1})/(1 - r) = a(-1)(r^{n+1} - 1)/(-1)(r - 1) = a(r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Yes, so they are equivalent. So the formula given in the problem is just the same as the standard formula, but written differently. So maybe I need to derive that formula from scratch.

Let me try multiplying both sides by (r - 1) to see if I can get something. But maybe a better approach is to use the method of subtracting the sum from itself multiplied by r.

Let me try that. Let me write S = a + ar + ar² + ... + arⁿ.

Multiply both sides by r:

rS = ar + ar² + ar³ + ... + ar^{n+1}.

Now, if I subtract the original S from this equation:

rS - S = (ar + ar² + ... + ar^{n+1}) - (a + ar + ar² + ... + arⁿ).

Let me compute the right-hand side. Let's see:

The first term of rS is ar, and the original S starts with a. So when we subtract, the ar cancels with the -ar from S, the ar² cancels with -ar², and so on, up to arⁿ. Then, what's left is the last term of rS, which is ar^{n+1}, minus the first term of S, which is a. So:

rS - S = ar^{n+1} - a.

Therefore, factoring out S from the left side:

S(r - 1) = a(r^{n+1} - 1).

Then, solving for S:

S = a(r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1).

Which is exactly the formula given in the problem. So that seems to work. But let me check if I did that correctly.

Wait, let me go through the subtraction again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Original S: a + ar + ar² + ar³ + ... + arⁿ.

Multiply by r: ar + ar² + ar³ + ... + ar^{n+1}.

Subtracting S from rS:

rS - S = (ar + ar² + ... + ar^{n+1}) - (a + ar + ar² + ... + arⁿ).

Let me write out the terms:

For the first term of rS: ar.

Subtracting the first term of S: a. So ar - a.

Then, the second term of rS: ar², subtract the second term of S: ar. So ar² - ar.

Third term: ar³ - ar².

...

Last term of rS: ar^{n+1} - arⁿ.

Wait, but when I subtract S from rS, all the intermediate terms cancel out. Let me check:

Let me think of it as:

rS - S = ar + ar² + ar³ + ... + ar^{n+1} - a - ar - ar² - ... - arⁿ.

So, the ar cancels with -ar, ar² cancels with -ar², ..., arⁿ cancels with -arⁿ. So what's left is ar^{n+1} - a. Yes, exactly. Therefore, rS - S = ar^{n+1} - a, which is S(r - 1) = a(r^{n+1} - 1). Therefore, S = a(r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Perfect.

So that seems to check out. Therefore, the formula is proven.

But maybe I should also check for a small value of n to see if it works. Let's take n = 1. Then the sum is a + ar. According to the formula, it should be a(r^{2} - 1)/(r - 1). Let's compute that. (r² - 1) factors into (r - 1)(r + 1), so dividing by (r - 1) gives (r + 1). Then multiplying by a gives a(r + 1). Which is a + ar. Correct. So that works.

Another example: n = 2. The sum is a + ar + ar². The formula gives a(r³ - 1)/(r - 1). Let's compute that. (r³ - 1) factors into (r - 1)(r² + r + 1). Dividing by (r - 1) gives (r² + r + 1), multiplied by a gives a(r² + r + 1), which is a + ar + ar². Correct again.

So that seems to work. Therefore, the derivation is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can use mathematical induction. Let me try that as another method to verify.

Base case: n = 0. Then the sum is a. According to the formula, it should be a(r^{1} - 1)/(r - 1) = a(r - 1)/(r - 1) = a. Correct.

Assume that for some integer k ≥ 0, the formula holds: S_k = a + ar + ... + ar^k = a(r^{k+1} - 1)/(r - 1).

Now, consider n = k + 1. Then the sum S_{k+1} = S_k + ar^{k+1}.

By the induction hypothesis, S_k = a(r^{k+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Therefore,

S_{k+1} = a(r^{k+1} - 1)/(r - 1) + ar^{k+1}.

Let me combine these terms:

= [a(r^{k+1} - 1) + ar^{k+1}(r - 1)] / (r - 1)

Compute numerator:

a(r^{k+1} - 1) + ar^{k+1}(r - 1) = a(r^{k+1} - 1 + r^{k+2} - r^{k+1}) = a(-1 + r^{k+2}) = a(r^{k+2} - 1).

Therefore, S_{k+1} = a(r^{k+2} - 1)/(r - 1), which is the formula for n = k + 1. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n.

So that also works. Therefore, both methods confirm that the formula is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the sum as a geometric series with first term a and ratio r, and number of terms n + 1. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a(1 - r^{n+1})/(1 - r), which is the same as the given formula when we multiply numerator and denominator by -1.

But since the problem says to show that it's equal to a(r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1), which is the same as the standard formula, so that's another way to see it.

But regardless of the method, the key idea is multiplying the sum by r, subtracting the original sum, and then solving for the sum. That seems to be the standard method for deriving the formula.

Therefore, I think that the proof is correct. The key steps are:

1. Let S be the sum.

2. Multiply S by r to get rS.

3. Subtract S from rS to eliminate all terms except the first and last.

4. Solve for S.

Therefore, the formula is proven.

I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The examples check out, and the induction also works. So I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\frac{a(r^{n+1}-1)}{r-1}}
</think>

To prove the formula for the sum of the geometric series:

$$
a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^n = \frac{a(r^{n+1} - 1)}{r - 1}, \quad \text{for } r \neq 1
$$

we proceed by using a standard algebraic method involving multiplication and subtraction.

### Step 1: Define the Sum

Let the sum be denoted by $ S $:

$$
S = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \ldots + ar^n
$$

This is a geometric series with first term $ a $, common ratio $ r $, and $ n+1 $ terms.

---

### Step 2: Multiply the Sum by $ r $

$$
rS = ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \ldots + ar^{n+1}
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract the Original Sum from $ rS $

$$
rS - S = (ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^{n+1}) - (a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^n)
$$

Now, subtract term by term:

- The $ ar $ cancels with the $ -ar $
- The $ ar^2 $ cancels with the $ -ar^2 $
- ...
- The $ ar^n $ cancels with the $ -ar^n $

Only the first term of $ rS $, which is $ ar^{n+1} $, and the last term of $ S $, which is $ a $, remain:

$$
rS - S = ar^{n+1} - a
$$

---

### Step 4: Factor and Solve for $ S $

$$
S(r - 1) = a(r^{n+1} - 1)
$$

$$
S = \frac{a(r^{n+1} - 1)}{r - 1}
$$

This is the desired result.

---

### Step 5: Verification via Examples

- For $ n = 0 $, the sum is just $ a $. The formula gives:

$$
\frac{a(r^1 - 1)}{r - 1} = \frac{a(r - 1)}{r - 1} = a
$$

- For $ n = 1 $, the sum is $ a + ar $. The formula gives:

$$
\frac{a(r^2 - 1)}{r - 1} = a \cdot \frac{(r - 1)(r + 1)}{r - 1} = a(r + 1) = a + ar
$$

Both match, confirming the correctness.

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\frac{a(r^{n+1} - 1)}{r - 1}}
$$
