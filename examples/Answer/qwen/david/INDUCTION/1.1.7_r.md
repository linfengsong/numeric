Okay, so I need to use mathematical induction to prove that the sum 1(1!) + 2(2!) + 3(3!) + ... + n(n!) equals (n + 1)! - 1 for all integers n ≥ 1. Let me start by recalling what mathematical induction is. It's a method of mathematical proof used to establish that a statement holds true for all natural numbers. The process involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step.

First, I need to verify the base case. The base case is usually when n = 1. Let me check that. If n = 1, the left side of the equation is just 1(1!) which is 1*1 = 1. The right side is (1 + 1)! - 1 = 2! - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. So both sides are equal. That checks out. Good, the base case holds.

Now, moving on to the inductive step. This is where I need to prove that if the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, then it must also be true for k + 1. In other words, I need to assume that for n = k, the equation holds, and then show that for n = k + 1, the equation also holds.

So, let me denote the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation as S(n) = 1(1!) + 2(2!) + ... + n(n!). According to the problem, S(n) = (n + 1)! - 1.

Assume that S(k) = (k + 1)! - 1. Now, I need to show that S(k + 1) = (k + 2)! - 1.

Let me write S(k + 1) as S(k) + (k + 1)(k + 1)!.

Because S(k + 1) is the sum up to (k + 1)(k + 1)!, so adding that term to the sum up to k gives the sum up to k + 1.

So substituting the inductive hypothesis into this, we get:

S(k + 1) = S(k) + (k + 1)(k + 1)! = [(k + 1)! - 1] + (k + 1)(k + 1)!.

Now, let me simplify this expression. Let me factor out (k + 1)! from the two terms. Wait, the first term is (k + 1)! and the second term is (k + 1)(k + 1)!.

So, let me write it as:

(k + 1)! + (k + 1)(k + 1)! - 1.

Factor out (k + 1)! from the first two terms:

(k + 1)! [1 + (k + 1)] - 1.

Calculating 1 + (k + 1) gives k + 2. Therefore:

(k + 1)! (k + 2) - 1.

But (k + 1)! multiplied by (k + 2) is equal to (k + 2)! because (k + 2)! = (k + 2)(k + 1)!.

Therefore, this simplifies to:

(k + 2)! - 1.

Which is exactly the right-hand side of the equation for n = k + 1. Therefore, the inductive step holds.

Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, since the base case holds and the inductive step is valid, the formula is true for all n ≥ 1.

Wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So starting with S(k + 1) = S(k) + (k + 1)(k + 1)!.

Then substituting S(k) = (k + 1)! - 1, so adding (k + 1)(k + 1)! gives:

(k + 1)! - 1 + (k + 1)(k + 1)!.

Then factoring (k + 1)! from the first and third term? Wait, actually, the first term is (k + 1)! and the second term is (k + 1)(k + 1)!.

So combining them:

(k + 1)! [1 + (k + 1)] - 1.

Yes, that's correct. 1 + (k + 1) is k + 2, so (k + 1)!*(k + 2) is (k + 2)!.

Therefore, the result is (k + 2)! - 1. Which matches the desired formula. So that seems correct.

But let me test with a small value of n to make sure. Let's take n = 2.

For n = 2, the left side is 1(1!) + 2(2!) = 1*1 + 2*2 = 1 + 4 = 5.

The right side is (2 + 1)! - 1 = 3! - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5. Correct.

Another test with n = 3.

Left side: 1(1!) + 2(2!) + 3(3!) = 1 + 4 + 18 = 23.

Right side: (3 + 1)! - 1 = 4! - 1 = 24 - 1 = 23. Correct.

Another test with n = 4.

Left side: 1 + 4 + 18 + 4*24 = 1 + 4 + 18 + 96 = 119.

Right side: 5! - 1 = 120 - 1 = 119. Correct.

So the formula seems to hold for these values. Therefore, the induction steps seem valid.

But let me think again about the inductive step. Maybe I should write it more formally.

Assume that for some integer k ≥ 1, S(k) = (k + 1)! - 1. Then S(k + 1) = S(k) + (k + 1)(k + 1)! = (k + 1)! - 1 + (k + 1)(k + 1)!.

Factor out (k + 1)!:

(k + 1)! [1 + (k + 1)] - 1 = (k + 1)! (k + 2) - 1 = (k + 2)! - 1. Which is exactly the formula for n = k + 1. Therefore, the inductive step is valid.

So yes, the proof by induction is correct. Therefore, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1.

Wait, but the original problem statement says "n ≥ 1", and the formula is (n + 1)! - 1. So, for n = 1, (1 + 1)! - 1 = 2! - 1 = 1, which matches. So that's correct.

Therefore, the induction proof is valid.

I think that's all. The key step was recognizing that when you add the next term, you can factor out (k + 1)! and simplify it to (k + 2)!.

Another way to think about the original sum is that each term n(n!) can be rewritten. Let me see:

Note that n(n!) = n! * n = (n + 1 - 1) * n! = (n + 1)! - n!.

Wait, let me check that:

(n + 1)! = (n + 1) * n! So, (n + 1)! - n! = n! * (n + 1 - 1) = n! * n = n(n!). Therefore, n(n!) = (n + 1)! - n!.

Therefore, the sum S(n) = sum_{k=1}^n [ (k + 1)! - k! ].

Which is a telescoping series. Let me write that out:

For k = 1: 2! - 1!

k = 2: 3! - 2!

k = 3: 4! - 3!

...

k = n: (n + 1)! - n!

Adding all these up, the sum is:

(2! - 1!) + (3! - 2!) + (4! - 3!) + ... + [(n + 1)! - n!]

All the intermediate terms cancel out, leaving (n + 1)! - 1!.

Which is (n + 1)! - 1. Therefore, this is another way to see it, without induction. But the problem specifically asks to use mathematical induction. However, this telescoping approach is a good check.

But since the problem requires induction, I need to stick to that method. However, this alternative approach gives me more confidence that the formula is correct.

But since the problem is about induction, I think my previous steps are sufficient.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the formula holds for all n ≥ 1 by mathematical induction.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{(n + 1)! - 1}
</think>

To prove the formula

$$
1(1!) + 2(2!) + 3(3!) + \ldots + n(n!) = (n + 1)! - 1
$$

for all integers $ n \geq 1 $, we use **mathematical induction**. This method consists of two key steps: the **base case** and the **inductive step**.

---

### **Step 1: Base Case (n = 1)**

We verify the formula for $ n = 1 $:

- Left-hand side (LHS): $ 1(1!) = 1 $
- Right-hand side (RHS): $ (1 + 1)! - 1 = 2! - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 $

Since both sides are equal, the base case holds.

---

### **Step 2: Inductive Step**

We now assume the formula is true for some integer $ k \geq 1 $, i.e.,

$$
S(k) = 1(1!) + 2(2!) + \ldots + k(k!) = (k + 1)! - 1
$$

We must show that the formula holds for $ n = k + 1 $, i.e.,

$$
S(k + 1) = 1(1!) + 2(2!) + \ldots + (k + 1)(k + 1)! = (k + 2)! - 1
$$

We can write:

$$
S(k + 1) = S(k) + (k + 1)(k + 1)!
$$

Substituting the inductive hypothesis:

$$
S(k + 1) = [(k + 1)! - 1] + (k + 1)(k + 1)!
$$

Now, factor out $ (k + 1)! $ from the two terms:

$$
S(k + 1) = (k + 1)! \left[1 + (k + 1)\right] - 1 = (k + 1)! (k + 2) - 1
$$

But $ (k + 1)! (k + 2) = (k + 2)! $, so:

$$
S(k + 1) = (k + 2)! - 1
$$

This is exactly the formula we wanted to prove for $ n = k + 1 $.

---

### **Conclusion**

Since the base case holds and the inductive step is valid, by the **Principle of Mathematical Induction**, the formula

$$
1(1!) + 2(2!) + 3(3!) + \ldots + n(n!) = (n + 1)! - 1
$$

is true for all integers $ n \geq 1 $.

### **Final Answer**
$$
\boxed{(n + 1)! - 1}
