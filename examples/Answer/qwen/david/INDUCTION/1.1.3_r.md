Okay, so I need to use the Second Principle of Finite Induction to prove that for all integers n ≥ 1, the equation aⁿ - 1 equals (a - 1) times the sum of a^{n-1} + a^{n-2} + ... + a + 1. Hmm, let me recall what the Second Principle of Finite Induction is. I think it's also called Strong Induction. The idea is that to prove a statement P(n) is true for all n ≥ 1, we assume that it's true for all previous values up to some k, and then prove it for k+1. Right?

So first, I need to make sure I understand the formula. The left side is aⁿ - 1, and the right side is (a - 1) multiplied by a sum that starts with a^{n-1} and goes down to a^0 (which is 1). For example, if n=1, then the right side would be (a - 1)(a^{0}) = (a - 1)(1) = a - 1, and the left side is a^1 - 1 = a - 1. So that checks out for n=1. Maybe I should check n=2 as well. For n=2, left side is a² - 1. The right side is (a - 1)(a^{1} + 1) = (a - 1)(a + 1) = a² - 1. Yep, that works too. So the formula seems correct for small n. But I need to prove it for all n ≥ 1 using strong induction.

Alright, so the steps for strong induction are:

1. **Base case**: Verify the statement for the initial value, which here is n=1.

2. **Inductive step**: Assume that the statement holds for all integers from 1 up to some arbitrary integer k (where k ≥ 1), and then prove it for k+1.

So let me start with the base case. For n=1, as I checked before, both sides equal a - 1. So the base case is true.

Now, the inductive step. Assume that for all integers m with 1 ≤ m ≤ k, the equation a^m - 1 = (a - 1)(a^{m-1} + a^{m-2} + ... + a + 1) holds. Now, I need to show that the equation holds for m = k+1. That is, I need to show that a^{k+1} - 1 = (a - 1)(a^{k} + a^{k-1} + ... + a + 1).

Hmm. How can I relate a^{k+1} - 1 to the previous cases? Maybe I can manipulate the expression a^{k+1} - 1 somehow. Let me think. If I can express a^{k+1} - 1 in terms of a^{k} - 1 or something similar. Alternatively, maybe factor it using the formula for a difference of powers.

Wait, but the problem says to use the Second Principle of Induction, so I need to use the inductive hypothesis. Let me see.

Let me write down what I need to prove:

a^{k+1} - 1 = (a - 1)(a^{k} + a^{k-1} + ... + a + 1).

Alternatively, maybe I can write the right-hand side as (a - 1)(sum from i=0 to k of a^i). Wait, but the original formula is (a - 1)(a^{n-1} + ... + 1). So for n=k+1, the sum is from a^{k} down to a^0, which is the same as sum_{i=0}^k a^i. So yes, that's the same as the sum of a geometric series.

But maybe I need to use the inductive hypothesis here. Let me think. If I have a^{k+1} - 1, maybe I can factor it as (a - 1)(something). But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can write a^{k+1} - 1 as a * a^k - 1. But that might not help directly. Wait, perhaps I can use the inductive hypothesis for k and for k-1? Wait, but in strong induction, I can assume that the formula holds for all numbers up to k, so maybe I can use that.

Alternatively, let's consider the right-hand side of the equation for n=k+1. Let me denote S(k+1) = a^{k} + a^{k-1} + ... + a + 1. Then, the right-hand side is (a - 1) * S(k+1). Let me try to relate S(k+1) to S(k) or something else.

Note that S(k+1) = a^{k} + S(k). Because S(k) is a^{k-1} + ... + 1, so adding a^k to that gives S(k+1). Therefore, S(k+1) = a^k + S(k). So, if I can express (a - 1) * S(k+1) in terms of previous terms.

Alternatively, maybe I can write a^{k+1} - 1 as a * (a^k) - 1. But how does that relate to the inductive hypothesis?

Wait, here's an idea. Let's consider that a^{k+1} - 1 = a * a^k - 1. If I can express this as a*(a^k - 1) + (a - 1). Let me check:

a*(a^k - 1) + (a - 1) = a^{k+1} - a + a - 1 = a^{k+1} - 1. Yes! That works. So, a^{k+1} - 1 = a*(a^k - 1) + (a - 1).

Now, by the inductive hypothesis, since we're assuming that for m = k, the equation holds, so a^k - 1 = (a - 1)*S(k), where S(k) is the sum from i=0 to k-1 of a^i. Therefore, substituting that into the above equation:

a^{k+1} - 1 = a*( (a - 1)*S(k) ) + (a - 1) = (a - 1)*(a*S(k) + 1).

Now, let's look at the term a*S(k) + 1. Since S(k) is a^{k-1} + a^{k-2} + ... + a + 1, multiplying by a gives a^{k} + a^{k-1} + ... + a^2 + a. Then adding 1 gives a^{k} + a^{k-1} + ... + a^2 + a + 1, which is exactly S(k+1). Therefore, we have:

a^{k+1} - 1 = (a - 1)*S(k+1), which is exactly what we needed to prove for n = k+1. Therefore, by the inductive step, if the formula holds for all m ≤ k, then it holds for m = k+1. Since the base case holds, by strong induction, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1.

Wait, let me check that again. So the key step was expressing a^{k+1} - 1 as a*(a^k - 1) + (a - 1), then using the inductive hypothesis on a^k - 1, which is allowed because k is at least 1, and we have the inductive hypothesis for m = k. Then, substituting that expression, and then showing that the rest of the terms give us the sum S(k+1). That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The sum S(n) = (a^n - 1)/(a - 1), so multiplying both sides by (a - 1) gives a^n - 1. But the problem says to use induction, so I shouldn't just rely on that formula. But maybe that's a good way to check. However, since the problem specifically asks for induction, I need to stick with that approach.

Another way to think about the inductive step: suppose we have the formula for n = k, then we can use that to build the formula for n = k+1. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that a^{k+1} - 1 = (a - 1)(a^k + a^{k-1} + ... + 1). But how does that relate to the previous terms?

Wait, but in the inductive step, I need to use the assumption that for all m ≤ k, the formula holds. So for m = k, we have a^k - 1 = (a - 1)(sum from i=0 to k-1 of a^i). Then, if I can relate a^{k+1} - 1 to that. Which is what I did earlier.

So, the key was to express a^{k+1} - 1 as a*(a^k - 1) + (a - 1), then substitute the inductive hypothesis into that. Then, the rest follows.

Let me write that again step by step:

We want to show that a^{k+1} - 1 = (a - 1)(a^k + a^{k-1} + ... + a + 1).

We know from the inductive hypothesis that a^k - 1 = (a - 1)(a^{k-1} + a^{k-2} + ... + 1).

So, let's take the expression a^{k+1} - 1. Let me factor it as:

a^{k+1} - 1 = a * a^k - 1.

But if I can write this as a*(a^k - 1) + (a - 1). Let me check:

a*(a^k - 1) + (a - 1) = a^{k+1} - a + a - 1 = a^{k+1} - 1. Correct.

So, substituting the inductive hypothesis into this:

a^{k+1} - 1 = a*( (a - 1)(a^{k-1} + a^{k-2} + ... + 1) ) + (a - 1).

Factor out (a - 1):

= (a - 1)[a*(a^{k-1} + a^{k-2} + ... + 1) + 1].

Now, compute the term inside the brackets:

a*(a^{k-1} + a^{k-2} + ... + 1) + 1.

Multiply a into the sum:

a*a^{k-1} + a*a^{k-2} + ... + a*1 + 1.

Which is:

a^k + a^{k-1} + ... + a + 1.

Which is exactly the sum S(k+1) = a^k + a^{k-1} + ... + a + 1.

Therefore, we have:

a^{k+1} - 1 = (a - 1)*S(k+1), which is the desired result.

Therefore, the inductive step is complete.

So, since the base case holds and the inductive step is valid, by the Second Principle of Finite Induction, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1.

Wait, but let me check if there's another way someone might approach this. Maybe using the fact that the formula is the same as the geometric series sum. But since the problem requires induction, I think the above approach is correct.

Another thing to check: when k=1, then the inductive step would be for k+1=2. Let me verify that. For k=1, the inductive hypothesis is that a^1 - 1 = (a - 1)(a^0) which is true. Then, for k+1=2, we have a^2 - 1 = (a - 1)(a + 1). Which is true. So that works.

Similarly, for k=2, the inductive hypothesis is that a^2 - 1 = (a - 1)(a + 1). Then, for k+1=3, we have a^3 - 1 = (a - 1)(a^2 + a + 1). Which is true. So that works.

Therefore, the inductive step seems valid.

Therefore, I think the proof is correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{a^n - 1 = (a - 1)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2} + \ldots + a + 1)}

To prove the identity

$$
a^n - 1 = (a - 1)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2} + \cdots + a + 1)
$$

for all integers $ n \geq 1 $ using the **Second Principle of Finite Induction (Strong Induction)**, we follow a structured approach.

---

### **Step 1: Base Case**

We begin by verifying the identity for the smallest value of $ n $, which is $ n = 1 $:

- Left-hand side: $ a^1 - 1 = a - 1 $
- Right-hand side: $ (a - 1)(a^{1-1}) = (a - 1)(a^0) = (a - 1)(1) = a - 1 $

Both sides are equal, so the base case is satisfied.

---

### **Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**

Assume that the identity holds for all integers $ m $ such that $ 1 \leq m \leq k $, where $ k \geq 1 $. That is, for each such $ m $, we have:

$$
a^m - 1 = (a - 1)(a^{m-1} + a^{m-2} + \cdots + a + 1)
$$

This is the **inductive hypothesis**.

---

### **Step 3: Inductive Step**

We now aim to prove the identity for $ n = k+1 $. That is, we want to show:

$$
a^{k+1} - 1 = (a - 1)(a^k + a^{k-1} + \cdots + a + 1)
$$

To do this, we start with the left-hand side:

$$
a^{k+1} - 1 = a \cdot a^k - 1
$$

We can rewrite this as:

$$
a^{k+1} - 1 = a(a^k - 1) + (a - 1)
$$

Now, by the **inductive hypothesis**, we know that:

$$
a^k - 1 = (a - 1)(a^{k-1} + a^{k-2} + \cdots + a + 1)
$$

Substitute this into the expression:

$$
a^{k+1} - 1 = a \cdot \left[(a - 1)(a^{k-1} + a^{k-2} + \cdots + a + 1)\right] + (a - 1)
$$

Factor out $ (a - 1) $:

$$
a^{k+1} - 1 = (a - 1)\left[a(a^{k-1} + a^{k-2} + \cdots + a + 1) + 1\right]
$$

Now compute the term inside the brackets:

$$
a(a^{k-1} + a^{k-2} + \cdots + a + 1) + 1 = a^k + a^{k-1} + \cdots + a + 1
$$

This is exactly the sum $ a^k + a^{k-1} + \cdots + a + 1 $, which is the right-hand side of the identity for $ n = k+1 $.

Thus, we have shown:

$$
a^{k+1} - 1 = (a - 1)(a^k + a^{k-1} + \cdots + a + 1)
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

We have verified the base case and shown that if the identity holds for all $ m \leq k $, then it also holds for $ m = k+1 $. Therefore, by the **Second Principle of Finite Induction**, the identity is true for all $ n \geq 1 $.

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{a^n - 1 = (a - 1)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2} + \ldots + a + 1)}
$$
