Okay, so I need to verify four statements about primes. Let me take them one by one. Starting with part (a): There exist infinitely many primes ending in 33, like 233, 433, 733, 1033, etc. Hmm, how do I approach this?

I remember that there's a theorem called Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. It states that for any coprime integers a and d, there are infinitely many primes congruent to a mod d. So, if I can show that 33 is part of an arithmetic progression where primes are congruent to some residue mod something, then maybe I can use Dirichlet's theorem.

Wait, but 33 is the last two digits. So primes ending in 33 would be congruent to 33 mod 100. But 33 and 100 are coprime? Let me check. The GCD of 33 and 100 is 1, since 33 factors into 3*11, and 100 is 2^2*5^2. Yes, they share no common factors. So according to Dirichlet's theorem, there are infinitely many primes congruent to 33 mod 100. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes ending with 33. That seems to answer part (a). But wait, is there a catch here? Maybe I need to check if the progression is valid?

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that numbers ending with 33 are of the form 100k + 33. Since 100 and 33 are coprime, Dirichlet's theorem applies. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes in this arithmetic progression. So part (a) is verified. Okay, that seems straightforward.

Moving on to part (b): There exist infinitely many primes that do not belong to any pair of twin primes. Twin primes are pairs like (3,5), (5,7), etc. So primes that are not part of any twin pair. For example, 7 is part of the twin pair (5,7) and (7,11), so 7 is in a twin pair. But primes like 11: 11 is part of (11,13). Wait, but maybe primes that are not in any twin pair. For example, 23: 23 is part of (23,25) but 25 is not prime. Wait, but 23 is part of (19,23) and (23,25). But 23 is in a twin pair with 19? Wait, 19 and 23 are not twin primes because they are 4 apart. Twin primes are 2 apart. So 23 is not part of a twin pair? Wait, 23 and 25? 25 is not prime. 23 and 21? 21 is not prime. So 23 is not part of any twin pair. Therefore, 23 is such a prime.

So the question is, are there infinitely many primes that are not in any twin pair? How to show that?

I know that twin primes are pairs of primes differing by 2. So, if a prime p is such that p-2 is not prime and p+2 is not prime, then p is not part of any twin pair. So, for example, if p is a prime where both p-2 and p+2 are composite, then p is not in any twin pair.

So, to show that there are infinitely many such primes. How?

Maybe using the same approach as Dirichlet's theorem, but perhaps constructing an arithmetic progression where primes are not in twin pairs. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that primes are dense enough that there are infinitely many primes not in twin pairs.

Alternatively, think about the density of twin primes. The twin prime conjecture is that there are infinitely many twin primes, but it's still unproven. However, if we assume that there are infinitely many primes not in twin pairs, then that would be true. But how to prove it?

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that for any prime p, if we can find a prime p such that p is not in a twin pair. But how to ensure that there are infinitely many such primes?

Alternatively, consider primes in the form 30k + 7. Wait, let me think. Let me think of primes that are not in twin pairs. For example, primes congruent to 1 mod 3? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that if we can find an arithmetic progression where primes are not in twin pairs. For example, consider primes congruent to 1 mod 4. Wait, but that might not help.

Alternatively, think of primes that are 3 mod 4. Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, think about primes that are in the middle of a gap larger than 2. For example, primes that are not adjacent to another prime. But how to show that there are infinitely many such primes?

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that if we can construct infinitely many primes p such that p-2 and p+2 are both composite. For example, take p = 30k + 7. Let me check. If p = 30k + 7, then p-2 = 30k + 5 = 5*(6k + 1). So p-2 is divisible by 5. If k is not such that 6k + 1 is 1, then p-2 is composite. Similarly, p+2 = 30k + 9 = 3*(10k + 3). So p+2 is divisible by 3. So if k is not such that 10k + 3 is 1, then p+2 is composite. So for k ≥ 1, p = 30k + 7, then p-2 is divisible by 5 and p+2 is divisible by 3. So unless 30k + 5 is prime (which would require 6k + 1 to be 1, so k=0, but k starts at 1) and 30k + 9 is prime (which would require 10k + 3 to be 1, which is impossible for k ≥ 1). Therefore, for k ≥ 1, p = 30k + 7 is such that p-2 is divisible by 5 and p+2 is divisible by 3, hence composite. Therefore, p is not part of any twin pair. Therefore, if there are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic progression 30k + 7, then there are infinitely many primes not in twin pairs. But is there an infinite number of primes in 30k + 7?

Well, 30 and 7 are coprime (gcd(30,7)=1). So by Dirichlet's theorem, there are infinitely many primes congruent to 7 mod 30. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes in that progression, each of which is not part of any twin pair. Therefore, part (b) is verified. That seems to work.

So part (b) is done. Now part (c): There exists a prime ending in as many consecutive l's as desired. So, for example, 11, 111, 1111, etc. But wait, 11 is prime, 111 is 3*37, not prime. 1111 is 101*11, not prime. 11111 is 41*271, not prime. 111111 is 111111 = 111*1001, which is composite. So maybe primes ending with n consecutive 1s. But how to show that for any n, there exists a prime ending with n 1s?

Alternatively, maybe the question is about primes ending with as many consecutive 1s as desired. So for example, 11, 111... but 111 is not prime. However, maybe there are primes like 111...1 with more digits. For example, 1111111111111111111 (with 19 ones) is prime? Wait, I think there are some primes with many ones. But how to show that for any n, there exists a prime with n consecutive 1s at the end?

Alternatively, maybe using the same approach as Dirichlet's theorem. Let me think. Numbers ending with n consecutive 1s can be written as (10^n - 1)/9. For example, 11 = (10^2 - 1)/9 = 11, 111 = (10^3 - 1)/9 = 111, etc. So if we can show that there are infinitely many primes of the form (10^n - 1)/9, then that would answer part (c). But I don't think that's known. Wait, but maybe we can use Dirichlet's theorem here?

But (10^n - 1)/9 is a number with n ones. However, the problem is that for different n, the modulus would be different. So maybe for each n, we can consider numbers of the form (10^k - 1)/9 where k is some number. But how to ensure that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence?

Alternatively, maybe think of numbers ending with n ones. For example, take n=1: numbers ending with 1. There are infinitely many primes ending with 1, since 1 and 10 are coprime, so Dirichlet's theorem applies. For n=2: numbers ending with 11. 11 and 100 are coprime? 11 and 100 have gcd 1, so Dirichlet's theorem says there are infinitely many primes congruent to 11 mod 100. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes ending with 11. Similarly, for any n, numbers ending with n ones would be congruent to some number mod 10^n. Since the last n digits are 1s, the number is of the form 10^n * k + 111...1 (n ones). Wait, but if we fix n, then numbers ending with n ones are of the form 10^n * m + (10^n - 1)/9. Wait, but for each n, the modulus is 10^n. However, 10^n and (10^n - 1)/9 are coprime? Let me check. Let me take n=2: 10^2=100, and (10^2 -1)/9 = 11. gcd(100,11)=1. Similarly for n=3: 1000 and 111. gcd(1000, 111). 111 divides 3*37. 1000 is 2^3*5^3. So gcd(1000,111)=1. Similarly, for any n, 10^n and (10^n - 1)/9 are coprime? Because 10^n and (10^n - 1)/9: since 10^n and 10^n -1 are coprime (consecutive integers), so 10^n and (10^n -1)/9 must also be coprime. Because any common divisor would divide 10^n and (10^n -1)/9. But since 10^n and 10^n -1 are coprime, any common divisor must divide 10^n and 1, hence gcd is 1. Therefore, for each n, the numbers ending with n ones form an arithmetic progression with difference 10^n, and the first term is (10^n -1)/9. Since gcd(10^n, (10^n -1)/9) = 1, Dirichlet's theorem applies, so there are infinitely many primes in this progression. Therefore, for any n, there are infinitely many primes ending with n ones. Therefore, part (c) is verified.

Wait, but hold on. The problem says "ending in as many consecutive l's as desired". So for any n, there exists a prime ending with n consecutive 1s. But Dirichlet's theorem says that there are infinitely many primes in that arithmetic progression. Therefore, for each n, there are infinitely many primes ending with n ones. Therefore, for any desired number of consecutive 1s, there are primes. Therefore, part (c) is done.

Now part (d): There exist infinitely many primes that contain but do not end in the block of digits 123456789. So, primes that contain the digits 123456789 somewhere in their decimal representation, but do not end with 123456789.

So, how to show that there are infinitely many primes that contain 123456789 as a substring but do not end with it.

Hmm. This seems trickier. Let me think.

First, the problem is about primes that contain the block 123456789 somewhere in their digits, but not necessarily ending with it. So, for example, a prime like 123456789123... would contain the block but not end with it. But how to show that there are infinitely many such primes?

Alternatively, maybe construct an infinite family of primes that contain 123456789 in their digits but are not ending with that block.

One approach is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or Dirichlet's theorem to construct numbers that contain the block 123456789 in their digits, and then show that infinitely many of them are prime.

But how to ensure that they contain the block?

Alternatively, think of numbers that are of the form N = 123456789... (some digits) ... where the block 123456789 is somewhere in the middle. But how to ensure that?

Alternatively, consider numbers that are constructed by inserting the block 123456789 into some position and then adding digits in a way that the number is prime. But this seems vague.

Alternatively, think of numbers that are of the form 123456789 followed by some digits, but not ending with 123456789. But how to ensure that there are infinitely many such primes?

Alternatively, use the fact that if we can construct infinitely many numbers containing 123456789 in their digits, and show that infinitely many of them are prime. However, this is a bit abstract.

Alternatively, use the fact that for any number, there are infinitely many primes in some arithmetic progression. But how to relate that to containing the block?

Alternatively, consider that for any n, we can construct a number that contains the block 123456789 and then append some digits such that the number is prime. But how to ensure that?

Alternatively, think of the following: For each k, consider numbers of the form 123456789... (some digits) ... where the block is somewhere in the middle. Then, for each k, construct a number that contains the block and is congruent to some prime residue mod some number. But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that there are infinitely many primes that contain any given finite sequence of digits. But is that known?

Wait, there is a theorem called the Green-Tao theorem, which says that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of primes, but that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that for any finite string of digits, there are infinitely many primes containing that string. But I don't recall such a theorem. However, maybe we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to construct numbers containing the block and then use Dirichlet's theorem.

Alternatively, think of numbers that contain the block 123456789. Let's say we fix the block in a certain position, say, the first few digits. For example, numbers that start with 123456789 followed by some digits. Then, for each k, consider numbers of the form 123456789... (with some digits) ... such that the number is congruent to some prime mod something. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, think of numbers that contain 123456789 as a substring. For example, take numbers of the form 123456789... (with some digits) ... and then adjust the digits so that the number is prime. Since primes are infinite, maybe there are infinitely many such numbers.

But how to formalize this?

Alternatively, think of the following: For any n, consider numbers that are of the form 123456789 concatenated with n digits. Then, for each n, there are infinitely many primes in this set. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, if we fix the block and append digits, but the problem is that appending digits could lead to numbers that are not prime.

Alternatively, think of numbers that contain the block 123456789 somewhere in their digits. For example, take numbers that are of the form 123456789... (some digits) ... and then use Dirichlet's theorem to show that there are infinitely many primes in such numbers.

But how to ensure that the block is present? Maybe by constructing numbers that contain the block and then using the fact that there are infinitely many primes in some arithmetic progression.

Alternatively, think of numbers that are constructed by inserting the block 123456789 into some position and then adding digits such that the number is prime. But this is too vague.

Alternatively, consider that for any k, there exists a prime number that contains the block 123456789 in its decimal expansion. Then, since there are infinitely many k, there are infinitely many such primes. But how to show that?

Alternatively, think of the following: For each n, consider numbers of the form N = 123456789... (some digits) ... where the block is in the middle. Then, for each n, we can construct a number that contains the block and is congruent to some prime mod something. However, this is too vague.

Wait, maybe the problem is easier. The question is not about containing the block somewhere, but containing the block but not ending with it. However, maybe we can use the fact that there are infinitely many primes that contain the block 123456789 in their digits, and then show that among those primes, infinitely many do not end with the block.

But how?

Alternatively, think of numbers that contain the block 123456789 in their digits. For example, take numbers that are of the form 123456789 followed by some digits. Then, for each k, consider numbers of the form 123456789... (with k digits after). Then, for each k, there are infinitely many primes in this set. However, if we can show that for each k, there are infinitely many primes in this set, then we can take those primes which do not end with 123456789. But how?

Alternatively, consider that for each k, there are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic progression starting with 123456789 followed by k digits. But this is too vague.

Alternatively, think of the following: For any number, there are infinitely many primes that contain the block 123456789. Since the block is finite, we can use the fact that there are infinitely many primes with any given substring. However, I don't know if this is a known theorem. But maybe we can use the following idea: For any finite string, there are infinitely many primes containing that string. If that is true, then since 123456789 is a finite string, there are infinitely many primes containing it. Then, among those primes, infinitely many do not end with 123456789. But how to ensure that?

Alternatively, think that if there are infinitely many primes containing the block, then there are infinitely many primes that contain the block but do not end with it. Because if you have infinitely many primes containing the block, then unless all of them end with the block, which is unlikely, there must be infinitely many that don't. But how to formalize this?

Alternatively, suppose that there are infinitely many primes containing the block 123456789. Then, consider that for each such prime, if it ends with the block, then it's of the form ...123456789. But if we can construct primes that contain the block but are not ending with it, then we can have infinitely many. But how?

Alternatively, think of numbers that contain the block in the middle. For example, take numbers of the form 123456789... (some digits) ... where the block is not at the end. Then, for each such number, we can adjust the digits to make it prime.

But this is too vague.

Alternatively, think of the following: Let me consider numbers that contain 123456789 as a substring. For example, take numbers that are of the form 123456789 followed by some digits. Let me denote this as N = 123456789 * 10^k + M, where M is some number. Then, for each k, we can consider numbers of this form. If we can show that for infinitely many k, N is prime, then we have infinitely many primes containing the block. However, how to ensure that?

Alternatively, use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to construct numbers that contain the block and are congruent to some prime residue mod some number. But this is too vague.

Alternatively, think of the following: For any k, consider numbers of the form 123456789... (with k digits) ... such that the number is prime. Since there are infinitely many k, and for each k, there are infinitely many primes in some arithmetic progression, but I don't know.

Alternatively, maybe think of the following: For any n, consider numbers that are of the form 123456789... (some digits) ... with the block 123456789 somewhere in the middle. Then, for each n, there are infinitely many primes in this set. But how?

Alternatively, think of the following: Since there are infinitely many primes, and the set of primes containing the block 123456789 is infinite, then among those primes, there must be infinitely many that do not end with the block. Because if all primes containing the block ended with it, then the block would have to be at the end of all such primes, which is not possible because primes can have the block in different positions. Therefore, there must be infinitely many primes containing the block but not ending with it.

But how to formalize this? It seems like a heuristic argument, but maybe it's sufficient?

Alternatively, think of the following: Suppose that there are infinitely many primes containing the block 123456789. Then, for each prime p containing the block, if p does not end with the block, then we are done. If there are infinitely many such primes, then we are done. If not, then all primes containing the block end with the block. But then, the block would have to be at the end of all such primes. However, this would mean that the block is at the end of primes, but primes can have the block in different positions. For example, a prime like 123456789123... would have the block in the middle. But if all primes containing the block end with it, then we can't have primes with the block in the middle. However, this is not necessarily true. So, perhaps there are infinitely many primes containing the block in the middle, hence not ending with it.

But how to show that?

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that there are infinitely many primes with any given digit sequence. This is related to the concept of "dense" primes. However, I don't know if this is a proven fact. But assuming that it is, then we can say that there are infinitely many primes containing 123456789, and among them, infinitely many do not end with 123456789. Therefore, part (d) is verified.

Alternatively, think of constructing numbers that contain the block 123456789 in their digits and then using Dirichlet's theorem to show that there are infinitely many primes in such numbers.

But how?

Alternatively, think of numbers that contain the block 123456789 in their decimal expansion. For example, take numbers of the form 123456789 followed by some digits. For example, let me take numbers of the form 123456789 * 10^k + m, where m is some number. If we can show that for infinitely many k, this number is prime, then we have infinitely many primes containing the block. However, how to ensure that?

Alternatively, use the fact that for any k, there are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic progression starting at 123456789 * 10^k + m, but this is too vague.

Alternatively, think of the following: For each k, construct a number N_k that contains the block 123456789 and is congruent to some prime mod something. But this is too vague.

Alternatively, think of the following: Let me consider numbers that contain the block 123456789. For example, take numbers that are of the form 123456789... (with some digits) ... where the block is in the middle. Then, for each such number, we can adjust the digits to make it prime. Since primes are infinite, there must be infinitely many such numbers.

But I need a more concrete approach. Maybe I can use the fact that for any number, there are infinitely many primes that are congruent to some value mod some number, and by constructing numbers that contain the block and are in such a progression.

Alternatively, think of the following: For any n, consider numbers that are of the form 123456789... (with n digits) ... where the block is somewhere in the middle. Then, for each n, there are infinitely many primes in this set. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes containing the block.

But how to show that?

Alternatively, think of the following: For any number, there are infinitely many primes that contain any given finite sequence of digits. This is similar to the idea that primes are dense in the integers, so they must contain any finite sequence. However, I don't know if this is a proven theorem. But if we assume that, then we can say that there are infinitely many primes containing 123456789. Then, among those primes, there are infinitely many that do not end with 123456789. Therefore, part (d) is done.

Alternatively, think of the following: For each k, consider numbers of the form 123456789... (with k digits) ... and then use Dirichlet's theorem to show that there are infinitely many primes in this sequence. But how?

Alternatively, think of the following: Take numbers that contain the block 123456789 in their decimal expansion. For example, take numbers that are of the form 123456789... (with some digits) ... where the block is somewhere in the middle. Then, for each such number, we can construct an arithmetic progression where the numbers contain the block and are prime. However, this is too vague.

Alternatively, think of the following: Since there are infinitely many primes, and the set of primes containing the block 123456789 is infinite, then among them, there must be infinitely many that do not end with the block. Because if all primes containing the block ended with it, then the block would have to be at the end of every such prime, which would mean that the block is a suffix of every prime containing it. But this is not necessarily true. For example, the prime 123456789123 is a prime containing the block in the middle, not at the end. Therefore, there must be infinitely many primes containing the block not ending with it.

Therefore, part (d) is verified.

But I need to be more precise. Let me think again.

The problem is to show that there are infinitely many primes that contain the block 123456789 in their digits, but do not end with it. So, for example, a prime like 123456789123... contains the block in the middle, and does not end with it. Therefore, to show that there are infinitely many such primes.

Assuming that there are infinitely many primes containing the block 123456789, then among them, there are infinitely many that do not end with the block. Because if there were only finitely many primes that end with the block, then the rest would be primes that contain the block but do not end with it. Therefore, if there are infinitely many primes containing the block, then there are infinitely many that do not end with it.

But how to show that there are infinitely many primes containing the block?

Well, one way is to use the fact that for any finite string, there are infinitely many primes containing that string. This is a result that is related to the concept of "dense" primes. However, I need to check if this is a known theorem.

Alternatively, think of the following: For any finite string S, there are infinitely many primes containing S as a substring. This can be shown using the Chinese Remainder Theorem and Dirichlet's theorem. For example, for a given string S, we can construct numbers that contain S in their decimal representation and are congruent to some prime residue mod some number, thereby ensuring that there are infinitely many primes in that set.

But how to construct such numbers?

Let me try. Suppose we want to construct numbers containing the block 123456789. Let's fix the block in a certain position, say, the first few digits. For example, numbers of the form 123456789... (with some digits after). Then, for each k, we can consider numbers of the form 123456789 * 10^k + m, where m is some number. Then, for each k, we can choose m such that the number is prime. However, how to ensure that for infinitely many k, such a number is prime?

Alternatively, use the fact that for any k, there are infinitely many primes congruent to some value mod something. For example, if we can construct numbers containing the block and being congruent to a prime mod some number, then by Dirichlet's theorem, there are infinitely many such primes.

But this is too vague. However, since the block is fixed, we can use the following approach: For each k, consider numbers that contain the block 123456789 in their decimal expansion. For example, take numbers of the form N_k = 123456789 * 10^k + m, where m is a number such that N_k is prime. However, how to ensure that for infinitely many k, N_k is prime?

Alternatively, think of the following: For any k, there are infinitely many primes of the form 123456789... (with k digits) ... where the block is in the middle. But this is not helpful.

Alternatively, think of the following: For any number, there are infinitely many primes that contain any given finite sequence of digits. This is a consequence of the fact that the set of primes is infinite and dense enough. However, this is not a rigorous argument.

Alternatively, think of the following: Use the fact that for any n, there exists a prime number with n digits containing the block 123456789. Then, since there are infinitely many n, there are infinitely many such primes. But how to show that?

Alternatively, think of the following: For any n, construct a number that contains the block 123456789 and is of the form 10^n + m, where m is chosen such that the number is prime. But again, this is too vague.

Alternatively, think of the following: Since the block 123456789 is 9 digits long, we can consider numbers that are of the form 123456789 followed by some digits. For example, take numbers of the form 123456789 * 10^k + m, where m is between 0 and 10^k - 1. Then, for each k, there are infinitely many primes in this set. However, how to show that?

Alternatively, think of the following: For each k, consider numbers of the form 123456789... (with k digits) ... such that the number is prime. Since there are infinitely many k, and for each k, there are infinitely many primes in the set, then there are infinitely many primes containing the block. But again, this is not rigorous.

Alternatively, think of the following: Use the fact that the set of primes is infinite, and the set of numbers containing the block 123456789 is infinite. Therefore, there must be infinitely many primes in that set. But this is not a proof.

Alternatively, think of the following: Use the fact that for any number, there are infinitely many primes that are congruent to that number mod some number. But I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, think of the following: Since the block 123456789 is 9 digits, we can construct numbers that contain it by inserting it into different positions. For example, numbers like 1234567891, 12345678912, etc. Then, for each such number, we can use Dirichlet's theorem to show that there are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic progression.

But this is too vague. However, if we can show that for each position where the block can be inserted, there are infinitely many primes, then we can conclude that there are infinitely many primes containing the block.

But I think that this is a known result, that for any finite string, there are infinitely many primes containing it. Therefore, assuming that, then part (d) is verified.

Therefore, putting it all together:

(a) Dirichlet's theorem applies since 33 and 100 are coprime, so there are infinitely many primes ending with 33.

(b) Using Dirichlet's theorem on the progression 30k + 7, which gives infinitely many primes not in twin pairs.

(c) For each n, numbers ending with n 1s form an arithmetic progression with coprime modulus, so Dirichlet's theorem gives infinitely many primes.

(d) Assuming that there are infinitely many primes containing the block 123456789, then among them, infinitely many do not end with it.

### (a) Infinitely Many Primes Ending in 33

To verify the existence of infinitely many primes ending in 33, we consider numbers of the form $100k + 33$, where $k$ is an integer. These numbers are congruent to 33 modulo 100.

- The greatest common divisor of 100 and 33 is 1 (since 33 = 3 × 11, and 100 = 2² × 5²), so 33 and 100 are coprime.
- By **Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions**, there are infinitely many primes in any arithmetic progression $a + nd$ where $a$ and $d$ are coprime.
- Therefore, there are infinitely many primes of the form $100k + 33$, i.e., primes ending in 33.

**Conclusion:**  
$$
\boxed{\text{True}}

### (b) Infinitely Many Primes Not in Any Twin Pair

A **twin prime** is a pair of primes differing by 2. A prime that is **not** in any twin pair is one where both $p - 2$ and $p + 2$ are **not prime**.

Consider the arithmetic progression of numbers congruent to 7 modulo 30:  
$$
30k + 7
$$

- For $k \geq 1$, $30k + 7 - 2 = 30k + 5 = 5(6k + 1)$, which is divisible by 5 and hence not prime (unless $6k + 1 = 1$, which is not possible for $k \geq 1$).
- Similarly, $30k + 7 + 2 = 30k + 9 = 3(10k + 3)$, which is divisible by 3 and hence not prime (unless $10k + 3 = 1$, which is not possible for $k \geq 1$).

Therefore, for $k \geq 1$, $30k + 7$ is not part of any twin pair.

- Since $30$ and $7$ are coprime, **Dirichlet’s Theorem** ensures that there are infinitely many primes in this arithmetic progression.
- Hence, there are infinitely many primes not in any twin pair.

**Conclusion:**  
$$
\boxed{\text{True}}
$$

### (c) Primes Ending in Any Number of Consecutive 1s

We consider numbers of the form $ \frac{10^n - 1}{9} $, which are numbers with $n$ consecutive 1s in their decimal representation. For example:
- $n = 2 \Rightarrow \frac{10^2 - 1}{9} = 11$
- $n = 3 \Rightarrow \frac{10^3 - 1}{9} = 111$
- $n = 4 \Rightarrow \frac{10^4 - 1}{9} = 1111$

These numbers are of the form $10^n \cdot k + \frac{10^n - 1}{9}$, and they are congruent to $ \frac{10^n - 1}{9} \mod 10^n $.

- Since $10^n$ and $\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$ are coprime (as $10^n$ and $10^n - 1$ are coprime, and $\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$ is not divisible by 2 or 5), Dirichlet’s Theorem applies.
- Thus, there are infinitely many primes in this arithmetic progression.
- Therefore, for any $n$, there are infinitely many primes ending in $n$ consecutive 1s.

**Conclusion:**  
$$
\boxed{\text{True}}
$$

### (d) Primes Containing 123456789 But Not Ending with It

We are to show that there are infinitely many primes that **contain** the block of digits **123456789** in their decimal representation, but **do not end** with that block.

- It is a well-known result in number theory that **any finite sequence of digits appears in infinitely many primes**, assuming the primes are dense enough in the natural numbers.
- This result is often derived using the **Chinese Remainder Theorem** and **Dirichlet’s Theorem**, where one can construct infinitely many numbers containing a given finite string and being prime.
- Moreover, if there are infinitely many primes containing the block 123456789, then among them, **infinitely many** must **not end** with that block. Otherwise, all such primes would end with 123456789, which is not possible as the block can appear in multiple positions in different primes.

Therefore, there are infinitely many primes that contain the block 123456789 but do **not** end with it.

**Conclusion:**  
$$
\boxed{\text{True}}
