<think>
Okay, so I need to find all pairs of prime numbers p and q such that p minus q equals 3. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The smallest primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. Since we're dealing with primes, I should probably start by listing some primes and see which pairs differ by 3.

But maybe there's a better way than just brute-forcing through primes. Let me think about the properties of primes. The only even prime number is 2. All other primes are odd. So, if p and q are primes, and p - q = 3, then depending on whether p and q are even or odd, their difference will be even or odd.

Let me recall that the difference between two odd numbers is even. The difference between an even and an odd number is odd. Since 3 is odd, that means one of the primes must be even and the other must be odd. But the only even prime is 2. Therefore, either p is 2 more than q, or q is 2 more than p. But since p - q = 3, that would mean that p is 3 more than q. 

So, if p - q = 3, then one of them must be 2. Let me check both possibilities:

Case 1: q is 2. Then p = q + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5. Is 5 a prime? Yes, 5 is a prime. So (p, q) = (5, 2) is a possible pair.

Case 2: p is 2. Then q = p - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1. But -1 is not a prime number. So this case is invalid. Therefore, the only possible case is when q is 2 and p is 5.

Wait, but maybe there are other primes where p and q are both odd, but their difference is 3? But earlier I thought that the difference between two odd numbers is even, so if p and q are both odd, then p - q would be even. However, 3 is odd, so that can't happen. Therefore, there can't be two odd primes differing by 3. Therefore, the only possible pair is (5, 2). 

But let me check with some examples. Let's take q as 3. Then p would be 3 + 3 = 6. But 6 is not a prime. If q is 5, then p is 8, not prime. If q is 7, p is 10, not prime. Similarly, if q is 11, p is 14, not prime. So none of these work. 

What if q is 2? Then p is 5, which is prime. What if q is 2, but p is 5. That works. What if q is a larger prime? Let's try q = 3, p = 6 (non-prime). q = 5, p = 8 (non-prime). q = 7, p = 10 (non-prime). q = 11, p = 14 (non-prime). q = 13, p = 16 (non-prime). q = 17, p = 20 (non-prime). So none of these work. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another case where p is 2? But then q would be p - 3 = -1, which is not prime. So that's invalid.

Wait, but maybe there's another case where one of the primes is 2 and the other is 5. But that's already covered in case 1. 

But let me think again. Suppose p and q are primes with p - q = 3. Since 3 is odd, one of them must be even. The only even prime is 2. Therefore, either p = 2 or q = 2. If p = 2, then q = 2 - 3 = -1, which is not prime. If q = 2, then p = 2 + 3 = 5, which is prime. Therefore, the only possible pair is (5, 2). 

But wait, is there another possibility? For example, if q is 2, then p is 5. But maybe there are other primes where p is 3 more than q, but q is not 2? But earlier reasoning says that if both p and q are odd, their difference would be even, but 3 is odd, so that's impossible. Therefore, there are no other pairs. 

But let me check with q = 2, p = 5. That's valid. What if q is 3? Then p = 6, not prime. q = 5, p = 8, not prime. q = 7, p = 10, not prime. So no. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a prime q where q is 2, and p is 5. So that's the only one. 

But wait, let me check if there are primes larger than 5 where p - q = 3. For example, if q is 7, p is 10 (not prime). q = 11, p = 14 (not prime). q = 13, p = 16 (not prime). q = 17, p = 20 (not prime). q = 19, p = 22 (not prime). So none of these work. 

Alternatively, maybe if q is a larger prime, but p is also a prime. For example, if q is 3, p is 6 (not prime). If q is 5, p is 8 (not prime). If q is 7, p is 10 (not prime). If q is 11, p is 14 (not prime). So no. 

Alternatively, maybe there is another case where q is 2 and p is 5. So that's the only possible pair. 

But wait, what if p is 2? Then q would be -1, which is not a prime. So that's invalid. 

Alternatively, is there a case where both p and q are primes greater than 2? But then both would be odd, so their difference would be even. But 3 is odd, so that's impossible. Therefore, there can't be such primes. 

Therefore, the only pair is (5, 2). 

But let me check if there are any other primes where p - q = 3. For example, let's check primes in the higher range. Let me think of primes like 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, etc. 

If q is 7, p is 10 (not prime). q is 11, p is 14 (not prime). q is 13, p is 16 (not prime). q is 17, p is 20 (not prime). q is 19, p is 22 (not prime). q is 23, p is 26 (not prime). q is 29, p is 32 (not prime). So none of these are primes. 

Alternatively, if q is 3, p is 6 (not prime). If q is 5, p is 8 (not prime). So no. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a prime q where q is 2, and p is 5. That's the only one. 

Therefore, the only pair is (5, 2). 

But wait, is there another case where p is 2? No, because then q would be negative. 

Alternatively, maybe there is another prime pair where p - q = 3. Wait, let me check for example, q = 2, p = 5. Then 5 - 2 = 3. That's correct. 

Is there another pair? For example, if q is 2, then p is 5. If q is 5, then p is 8, which is not prime. If q is 7, p is 10, not prime. If q is 11, p is 14, not prime. So no. 

Alternatively, maybe if q is a larger prime, but p is also a prime. But as we saw, p would be q + 3. For example, if q is 3, p is 6, not prime. If q is 5, p is 8, not prime. If q is 7, p is 10, not prime. If q is 11, p is 14, not prime. If q is 13, p is 16, not prime. If q is 17, p is 20, not prime. If q is 19, p is 22, not prime. If q is 23, p is 26, not prime. 

So none of these are primes. Therefore, the only possible pair is (5, 2). 

But let me check if there are any other primes where p - q = 3. For example, if p is 7, then q would be 4, which is not prime. If p is 11, then q is 8, not prime. If p is 13, q is 10, not prime. If p is 17, q is 14, not prime. If p is 19, q is 16, not prime. If p is 23, q is 20, not prime. So none of these work. 

Therefore, the only possible pair is (5, 2). 

But wait, let me check if there are any other primes where p is 3 more than q. For example, q = 2, p = 5. Then q = 5, p = 8 (non-prime). q = 7, p = 10 (non-prime). q = 11, p = 14 (non-prime). So no. 

Alternatively, maybe if q is a larger prime, but p is also a prime. But as we saw, p would be q + 3. For example, if q is 7, p is 10 (non-prime). If q is 13, p is 16 (non-prime). If q is 19, p is 22 (non-prime). So no. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the only pair is (5, 2). 

But wait, let me check if there are any primes where p is 3 more than q, but q is not 2. But according to the earlier reasoning, since p - q = 3 is odd, one of them must be even. Since 2 is the only even prime, then either p or q must be 2. If q is 2, then p is 5. If p is 2, then q is -1, which is not prime. Therefore, only (5, 2). 

Therefore, the answer is the pair (5, 2). 

But let me check if there are any other primes. For example, if q is 2, p is 5. What if q is 2, and p is 5. That's correct. 

Alternatively, if we consider negative primes? But primes are defined as positive integers greater than 1. So negative numbers are not considered primes. Therefore, no. 

So, the only possible pair is (5, 2). Therefore, the answer is \boxed{(5, 2)}.

**Final Answer**
The only pair of primes $ p $ and $ q $ satisfying $ p - q = 3 $ is \boxed{(5, 2)}.

To solve the problem of finding all pairs of prime numbers $ p $ and $ q $ such that $ p - q = 3 $, we begin by analyzing the properties of primes and how their differences behave.

### Step 1: Understanding the Nature of Primes

- The only **even prime** is **2**. All other primes are **odd**.
- The difference between two **odd numbers** is **even**.
- The difference between an **even number** and an **odd number** is **odd**.

Since $ p - q = 3 $ is an **odd number**, it must be that one of $ p $ or $ q $ is **even**, and the other is **odd**.

But the only even prime is **2**. So, either:

- $ p = 2 $, or
- $ q = 2 $

Let’s explore both cases.

---

### Step 2: Case Analysis

#### **Case 1: $ q = 2 $**
Then:
$$
p = q + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5
$$
Check if 5 is prime → **Yes**, 5 is a prime number.

So, one valid pair is:
$$
(p, q) = (5, 2)
$$

#### **Case 2: $ p = 2 $**
Then:
$$
q = p - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1
$$
But **-1 is not a prime**. So this case is invalid.

---

### Step 3: Consider Other Possibilities

Suppose both $ p $ and $ q $ are **odd primes**. Then their difference $ p - q $ would be **even**, but 3 is **odd**, so this is not possible.

Hence, the only possible case is when one of the primes is **2** (the only even prime), and the other is **5**, which is **odd**.

---

### Step 4: Verifying Exhaustively

Let’s confirm by checking small primes:

- $ q = 3 \Rightarrow p = 6 $ (not prime)
- $ q = 5 \Rightarrow p = 8 $ (not prime)
- $ q = 7 \Rightarrow p = 10 $ (not prime)
- $ q = 11 \Rightarrow p = 14 $ (not prime)
- $ q = 13 \Rightarrow p = 16 $ (not prime)

None of these yield a prime $ p $, so no other valid pairs exist.

---

### Final Conclusion

The only pair of primes $ p $ and $ q $ such that $ p - q = 3 $ is:

$$
\boxed{(5, 2)}
