Okay, so I need to find a positive integer that can't be written as p + a², where p is either a prime or 1, and a is a non-negative integer. Let me start by understanding the problem properly.

First, the conjecture says that for any positive integer N, there exists some prime number p (or 1) and some non-negative integer a such that N = p + a². My task is to find a counterexample where this isn't possible.

Let me think about small numbers first. Maybe start checking numbers one by one to see if they can be expressed in that form.

Starting with N=1: Can 1 be written as p + a²? Well, if a=0, then a²=0, so p would need to be 1. Since 1 is allowed (as p can be 1), then yes, 1 = 1 + 0². So that works.

N=2: Let's see. If a=0, then p=2. 2 is prime, so 2 = 2 + 0². That works.

N=3: Similarly, a=0, p=3. Prime, so that works.

N=4: a=0, p=4. But 4 is not prime. However, p can be 1. So 1 + a² = 4. Then a² = 3. But 3 isn't a perfect square. So maybe try a=1: a²=1, so p=4-1=3, which is prime. So 3 + 1² = 4. That works.

N=5: a=0, p=5. Prime. So 5 = 5 + 0². Works.

N=6: a=0, p=6. Not prime. So try a=1: 1²=1, so p=6-1=5, which is prime. So 5 + 1 = 6. Works.

N=7: a=0, p=7. Prime. So 7 = 7 + 0². Works.

N=8: a=0, p=8. Not prime. Try a=1: p=8 - 1 = 7, which is prime. 7 + 1 = 8. Works.

N=9: a=0, p=9. Not prime. Try a=1: p=9 - 1 = 8, not prime. a=2: a²=4, p=9 - 4 = 5, which is prime. So 5 + 4 = 9. Works.

N=10: a=0, p=10. Not prime. a=1: p=10 - 1 = 9, not prime. a=2: p=10 - 4 = 6, not prime. a=3: p=10 - 9 = 1. 1 is allowed. So 1 + 3² = 1 + 9 = 10. Works.

N=11: a=0, p=11. Prime. Works.

N=12: a=0, p=12. Not prime. a=1: p=11, prime. 11 + 1 = 12. Works.

N=13: a=0, p=13. Prime. Works.

N=14: a=0, p=14. Not prime. a=1: p=13, prime. 13 + 1 = 14. Works.

N=15: a=0, p=15. Not prime. a=1: p=14, not prime. a=2: p=15 - 4 = 11, prime. So 11 + 4 = 15. Works.

N=16: a=0, p=16. Not prime. a=1: p=15, not prime. a=2: p=16 - 4 = 12, not prime. a=3: p=16 - 9 = 7, prime. So 7 + 9 = 16. Works.

N=17: a=0, p=17. Prime. Works.

N=18: a=0, p=18. Not prime. a=1: p=17, prime. 17 + 1 = 18. Works.

N=19: a=0, p=19. Prime. Works.

N=20: a=0, p=20. Not prime. a=1: p=19, prime. 19 + 1 = 20. Works.

Hmm, so up to 20, all numbers can be expressed in that form. Maybe I need to check higher numbers. Let me try N=21.

N=21: a=0, p=21. Not prime. a=1: p=20, not prime. a=2: p=21 - 4 = 17, prime. So 17 + 4 = 21. Works.

N=22: a=0, p=22. Not prime. a=1: p=21, not prime. a=2: p=22 - 4 = 18, not prime. a=3: p=22 - 9 = 13, prime. 13 + 9 = 22. Works.

N=23: a=0, p=23. Prime. Works.

N=24: a=0, p=24. Not prime. a=1: p=23, prime. 23 + 1 = 24. Works.

N=25: a=0, p=25. Not prime. a=1: p=24, not prime. a=2: p=25 - 4 = 21, not prime. a=3: p=25 - 9 = 16, not prime. a=4: p=25 - 16 = 9, not prime. a=5: p=25 - 25 = 0. But p has to be 1 or prime. 0 isn't allowed. Wait, so is there any a where p is 1 or prime?

Wait, let me check again. Maybe I missed something. For N=25, trying different a:

a=0: p=25, not prime.

a=1: p=24, not prime.

a=2: p=21, not prime.

a=3: p=16, not prime.

a=4: p=9, not prime.

a=5: p=0, invalid.

a=6: a²=36, which is larger than 25. So no. So none of these work. Wait, but p has to be 1 or prime. So maybe a= something else?

Wait, is there any a such that 25 - a² is 1 or a prime?

Let me check:

If 25 - a² = 1, then a² = 24. Not a square.

If 25 - a² is prime. Let's check for a from 0 to 5:

a=0: 25 - 0 = 25, not prime.

a=1: 24, not prime.

a=2: 21, not prime.

a=3: 16, not prime.

a=4: 9, not prime.

a=5: 0, invalid.

So none of these. Therefore, N=25 cannot be written as p + a² where p is prime or 1. Therefore, 25 is a counterexample?

Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake here. Is there any other a?

Wait, a can be any non-negative integer. But if a is larger than 5, then a² is larger than 25, so 25 - a² would be negative, which can't be p (since p is positive). Therefore, no. Therefore, N=25 cannot be expressed in that form. Therefore, the conjecture is not true.

But wait, let me check again. Maybe I missed something. For example, if a is 0, p is 25. But 25 is not prime. If a is 1, p=24, not prime. a=2, p=21, not prime. a=3, p=16, not prime. a=4, p=9, not prime. a=5, p=0, invalid. So indeed, no solution. Therefore, 25 is a counterexample.

But wait, let me check if there is another way. For example, maybe p=1? If p=1, then a² = N - 1. For N=25, a²=24. Which is not a square. So no. Therefore, no solution. Therefore, 25 cannot be expressed as p + a² with p prime or 1, and a non-negative integer.

Therefore, 25 is a counterexample. But let me check if there is any mistake here. Maybe I made a mistake in considering a= something else? For example, maybe a= something else?

Wait, for example, if a= sqrt(25 - p). But p has to be 1 or prime. Let me check for p=2, then a²=25 - 2=23, not square. p=3, a²=22, nope. p=5, a²=20, nope. p=7, a²=18, nope. p=11, a²=14, nope. p=13, a²=12, nope. p=17, a²=8, nope. p=19, a²=6, nope. p=23, a²=2, nope. p=2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. All primes less than 25. And p=1, a²=24, which is not square. So no. So indeed, 25 can't be expressed in that way.

But wait, let me check if there's any other way. For example, maybe a= something larger? But if a is larger than 5, then a² is larger than 25, so p would be negative. Which is not allowed. Therefore, no.

Therefore, 25 is a counterexample. Therefore, the conjecture is not true.

But wait, let me check if there is any other number before 25 that I might have missed. Let me check N=16 again. Wait, 16 was okay. N=25 is the first one that seems problematic. Let me check N=25 again. Yes, seems like it's not possible. Therefore, the answer is 25.

But let me check another number, maybe 26, just to see if it's possible. For N=26:

a=0: p=26, not prime.

a=1: p=25, not prime.

a=2: p=26 - 4 = 22, not prime.

a=3: p=26 - 9 = 17, which is prime. So 17 + 9 = 26. So that works. Therefore, 26 is okay.

Similarly, N=27:

a=0: p=27, not prime.

a=1: p=26, not prime.

a=2: p=27 - 4 = 23, prime. So 23 + 4 = 27. Works.

N=28:

a=0: p=28, not prime.

a=1: p=27, not prime.

a=2: p=28 - 4 = 24, not prime.

a=3: p=28 - 9 = 19, prime. 19 + 9 = 28. Works.

N=29:

a=0: p=29, prime. Works.

N=30:

a=0: p=30, not prime.

a=1: p=29, prime. 29 + 1 = 30. Works.

So seems like 25 is the first number that fails. Therefore, 25 is a counterexample.

But wait, let me check N=49. Maybe there's a larger number? But the question is to give an example, so 25 is sufficient.

But let me check N=25 again. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Is there any possible way?

Suppose p is 1. Then a² = 25 - 1 = 24. 24 is not a square. If p is prime, then 25 - a² must be prime. Let me check for a from 0 to 5:

a=0: 25 - 0 = 25, not prime.

a=1: 24, not prime.

a=2: 21, not prime.

a=3: 16, not prime.

a=4: 9, not prime.

a=5: 0, invalid.

So no. Therefore, 25 cannot be expressed as p + a² with p prime or 1. Therefore, 25 is a counterexample. Therefore, the conjecture is false.

Alternatively, maybe there is another number. Let me check N=25. Wait, maybe I can use a larger a? For example, a=6, then a²=36. Then p=25 - 36 = negative. Not allowed. So no.

Therefore, 25 is indeed a counterexample.

But let me check another number, say N= 25 + 1 = 26, which works. N=25 - 1=24, which works. So 25 is the problem.

Alternatively, maybe there is another number. Let me check N= 121? Maybe? But 25 is smaller and works. So 25 is the first one.

But let me check another number, say N= 49. Let's see:

a=0: p=49, not prime.

a=1: p=48, not prime.

a=2: p=45, not prime.

a=3: p=40, not prime.

a=4: p=33, not prime.

a=5: p=24, not prime.

a=6: p=17, which is prime. 17 + 36 = 53? Wait, 6² is 36, so 49 - 36 = 13, which is prime. Wait, 13 + 36 = 49. So yes, 13 is prime, so 49 = 13 + 6². Therefore, 49 works.

So 49 is okay. How about N= 25? It's not. Therefore, 25 is the example.

Alternatively, let me check N= 121. Wait, but 25 is smaller. So 25 is the answer.

Wait, but maybe there is a mistake here. Let me check N= 25 again. Is there any possible combination?

Wait, maybe p= 2, and a²= 23? But 23 is not square.

p= 3, a²=22, nope.

p= 5, a²=20, nope.

p= 7, a²=18, nope.

p= 11, a²=14, nope.

p= 13, a²=12, nope.

p= 17, a²=8, nope.

p= 19, a²=6, nope.

p= 23, a²=2, nope.

p= 1, a²=24, nope.

So no. Therefore, 25 cannot be expressed in that form. Therefore, the conjecture is false. Therefore, 25 is a counterexample.

Hence, the answer is 25. Therefore, the example is 25.

**Final Answer**
The counterexample is \boxed{25}.
</think>

To determine whether the conjecture is true, we must examine whether *every* positive integer can be written in the form:

$$
N = p + a^2
$$

where:
- $ p $ is either a **prime number** or the number **1**, and
- $ a $ is a **non-negative integer**.

---

### Step-by-Step Analysis

We will test whether the number **25** can be written in the form $ p + a^2 $, where $ p \in \{1, \text{primes} \} $, and $ a \geq 0 $.

We test all possible values of $ a $, and for each, compute $ p = 25 - a^2 $, and check whether $ p $ is either 1 or a prime number.

#### Try $ a = 0 $:
$$
a^2 = 0 \Rightarrow p = 25 - 0 = 25 \quad \text{(not prime)}
$$

#### Try $ a = 1 $:
$$
a^2 = 1 \Rightarrow p = 25 - 1 = 24 \quad \text{(not prime)}
$$

#### Try $ a = 2 $:
$$
a^2 = 4 \Rightarrow p = 25 - 4 = 21 \quad \text{(not prime)}
$$

#### Try $ a = 3 $:
$$
a^2 = 9 \Rightarrow p = 25 - 9 = 16 \quad \text{(not prime)}
$$

#### Try $ a = 4 $:
$$
a^2 = 16 \Rightarrow p = 25 - 16 = 9 \quad \text{(not prime)}
$$

#### Try $ a = 5 $:
$$
a^2 = 25 \Rightarrow p = 25 - 25 = 0 \quad \text{(not allowed)}
$$

#### Try $ a = 6 $:
$$
a^2 = 36 \Rightarrow p = 25 - 36 = -11 \quad \text{(not allowed)}
$$

So, for all $ a \geq 0 $, the resulting $ p $ is either not a prime or not a valid positive number. Therefore, **no such representation exists** for $ N = 25 $.

---

### Conclusion

The number **25** is a counterexample to the conjecture, as it cannot be expressed in the form $ p + a^2 $ with $ p $ being either a prime or 1, and $ a \geq 0 $.

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{25}
