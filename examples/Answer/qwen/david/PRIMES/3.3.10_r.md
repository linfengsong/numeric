Okay, so I need to show that the sequence from (n + 1)! - 2 up to (n + 1)! - (n + 1) produces n consecutive composite numbers. The problem mentions "for n - 2," but maybe that's a typo? Wait, let me check again. The original question says: "Establish that the sequence ... produces n consecutive composite integers for n - 2." Hmm, maybe it's supposed to be "for n ≥ 2"? Or maybe there's a translation issue? Wait, maybe the original problem is in Chinese or another language, and "n - 2" is a mistranslation? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct as stated. Let me try to parse it. The sequence is from (n + 1)! - 2 to (n + 1)! - (n + 1). So how many terms are in this sequence? Let's see: starting at k = 2, ending at k = n + 1. So the number of terms is (n + 1) - 2 + 1 = n. So there are n terms. The problem says that this sequence produces n consecutive composite integers. So we need to show that each term in this sequence is composite.

But the problem says "for n - 2." Wait, maybe that's a misstatement. Maybe the problem is supposed to say "for n ≥ 2"? Or maybe "for n ≥ 3"? Because if n is 2, then (n + 1)! - 2 is 3! - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4, and (n + 1)! - (n + 1) is 6 - 3 = 3. So the sequence is 4, 3. But 3 is prime. So that's a problem. So maybe n has to be larger? Let me check for n = 3. Then (n + 1)! - 2 = 4! - 2 = 24 - 2 = 22, and (n + 1)! - (n + 1) = 24 - 4 = 20. The sequence is 22, 21, 20. Are these all composite? 22 is composite, 21 is composite, 20 is composite. Yes. So for n = 3, it works. For n = 4: (5)! - 2 = 120 - 2 = 118, down to 120 - 5 = 115. The numbers 118, 117, 116, 115. All composite? 118 is even, 117 is divisible by 3 (1+1+7=9), 116 is even, 115 is divisible by 5. Yes. So that works. For n = 2, as I saw, the sequence is 4, 3. 3 is prime, so that's a problem. So maybe the problem is for n ≥ 3? Or maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe "for n - 2" is supposed to be "for n ≥ 2", but with some adjustment. Maybe the original problem is correct, but I need to check.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct as stated, and "for n - 2" is actually a mistranslation or misstatement. Maybe it's supposed to be "for n ≥ 2", or "for n ≥ 3". Since for n=2, the sequence includes a prime, but for n ≥ 3, it works. So maybe the problem is supposed to say "for n ≥ 3", or maybe there's a different interpretation.

But regardless, the main task is to show that the sequence from (n + 1)! - 2 up to (n + 1)! - (n + 1) consists of n consecutive composite numbers. So let's focus on that.

So, take any integer k in the range 2 ≤ k ≤ n + 1. Then the term is (n + 1)! - k. We need to show that each of these numbers is composite.

Note that (n + 1)! is the factorial of (n + 1), so it's divisible by all integers from 1 up to (n + 1). Therefore, (n + 1)! - k is equal to a multiple of k minus k, which is (n + 1)! - k = k * [ (n + 1)! / k - 1 ]. Wait, but (n + 1)! is divisible by k, since k is between 2 and n + 1. Therefore, (n + 1)! - k is divisible by k. Therefore, (n + 1)! - k = k * m, where m is an integer. Therefore, if k is greater than 1, then (n + 1)! - k is a multiple of k, and since k is between 2 and n + 1, then (n + 1)! - k is at least (n + 1)! - (n + 1). But wait, if k is between 2 and n + 1, then (n + 1)! - k is divisible by k, and since k ≥ 2, then (n + 1)! - k is at least (n + 1)! - (n + 1). But for k ≥ 2, the term (n + 1)! - k is equal to k multiplied by something. However, if k is a factor of (n + 1)! - k, then if k is greater than 1, then (n + 1)! - k is composite unless k is 1 or the term itself is 1. But since k is between 2 and n + 1, then (n + 1)! - k is at least (n + 1)! - (n + 1). For n ≥ 2, (n + 1)! is at least 6, so (n + 1)! - (n + 1) is at least 6 - 3 = 3. But for example, when n = 2, (n + 1)! - k is 6 - 2 = 4, 6 - 3 = 3. So 3 is prime, which is why n=2 is problematic. However, for n ≥ 3, let's check.

For n ≥ 3, let's take k between 2 and n + 1. Then (n + 1)! - k is divisible by k, and since k is between 2 and n + 1, then (n + 1)! - k is divisible by k, and since k ≥ 2, then (n + 1)! - k is at least (n + 1)! - (n + 1). But if k divides (n + 1)! - k, then (n + 1)! - k = k * m, where m is an integer. Therefore, if k is at least 2, then m is at least (n + 1)! / k - 1. But since (n + 1)! is divisible by k, then m is an integer. Therefore, (n + 1)! - k is composite unless m = 1 or k = 1. But since k ≥ 2, then m must be at least (n + 1)! / k - 1. But (n + 1)! / k is at least (n + 1)! / (n + 1) = n! So m is at least n! - 1. For n ≥ 3, n! - 1 is at least 2! - 1 = 1, but for n ≥ 3, n! - 1 is at least 2. Therefore, m is at least 2, so (n + 1)! - k is composite. Therefore, each term in the sequence is composite.

Wait, but for k = n + 1, then (n + 1)! - (n + 1) = (n + 1)(n! - 1). Which is clearly composite, since it's a product of (n + 1) and (n! - 1), both of which are integers greater than 1 for n ≥ 2. For example, when n=2, (n + 1)! - (n + 1) = 3! - 3 = 6 - 3 = 3, which is prime. But here, n=2, so (n + 1)(n! - 1) = 3*(2! - 1) = 3*(2 - 1) = 3*1 = 3. Which is prime. So in that case, the term is prime. Therefore, for n=2, the last term is prime. Therefore, the problem might have a condition that n ≥ 3. Therefore, maybe the original problem says "for n ≥ 3", but there was a typo.

But the problem says "for n - 2". Maybe that's a mistranslation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the user is supposed to consider that n - 2 is the number of terms? Wait, no. The number of terms is n, as we saw earlier.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that the sequence produces n consecutive composite numbers for n - 2, meaning that when n is replaced by n - 2? That is, maybe the problem is supposed to be about n - 2? But that seems unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and we need to show that for n - 2, the sequence produces n consecutive composite numbers. Wait, but that would be confusing. Let me check again.

Original problem: "Establish that the sequence (n + 1)! - 2, (n + 1)! - 3, ..., (n + 1)! - (n + 1) produces n consecutive composite integers for n - 2."

Wait, maybe the problem is saying that for the value of n - 2, the sequence produces n consecutive composite numbers? That is, maybe the problem is mistyped and it's supposed to be "for n ≥ 2", or "for n ≥ 3", or maybe it's supposed to be "for n ≥ 2, the sequence produces n consecutive composite integers".

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the user is supposed to consider that n - 2 is the number of terms? But that seems not. The sequence from (n + 1)! - 2 to (n + 1)! - (n + 1) has n terms. So maybe the problem is correct, but the user is supposed to consider that for n - 2, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe there is a misinterpretation here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in Chinese, and "n - 2" is a mistranslation. Maybe the original problem is "for n ≥ 2", or "for n ≥ 3".

But regardless, given that for n ≥ 3, the sequence from (n + 1)! - 2 up to (n + 1)! - (n + 1) consists of n consecutive composite numbers, as each term is divisible by k (where k is from 2 to n + 1), and since k ≥ 2, then each term is composite. However, for n = 2, the last term is 3, which is prime, so n=2 is an exception.

Therefore, the problem might have a condition that n ≥ 3. Therefore, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the correct statement is that for n ≥ 3, the sequence produces n consecutive composite numbers.

Therefore, assuming that, the reasoning is as follows: Take any integer k in 2 ≤ k ≤ n + 1. Then (n + 1)! - k is divisible by k, because (n + 1)! is divisible by k. Therefore, (n + 1)! - k = k * m, where m = (n + 1)! / k - 1. Since k ≥ 2, and (n + 1)! / k is an integer, m is an integer. Now, if m ≥ 2, then (n + 1)! - k is composite. If m = 1, then (n + 1)! - k = k * 1 = k, which would be prime. However, m = 1 implies that (n + 1)! / k - 1 = 1, so (n + 1)! / k = 2, so (n + 1)! = 2k. But since k is between 2 and n + 1, let's see if this is possible.

For (n + 1)! = 2k, with 2 ≤ k ≤ n + 1. Let's check for possible n and k. For example, if n + 1 = 2, then n = 1, and k would be 2. Then (2)! = 2*2 = 4? But 2! is 2, which is not equal to 4. So no solution here. For n + 1 = 3, n = 2, k can be 2 or 3. If k=2, then 3! = 6 = 2*2 = 4? No. If k=3, 3! = 6 = 2*3 = 6. Yes. So here, when n + 1 = 3, n = 2, k = 3, then (n + 1)! - k = 6 - 3 = 3, which is prime. Therefore, for n=2, the last term is prime. But for n ≥ 3, can we have (n + 1)! = 2k?

Suppose n + 1 ≥ 4. Then (n + 1)! is divisible by 4, so 2k must be divisible by 4, so k must be even. Let's suppose k is even. Then 2k = (n + 1)! implies k = (n + 1)! / 2. But since k ≤ n + 1, then (n + 1)! / 2 ≤ n + 1. But for n + 1 ≥ 4, (n + 1)! / 2 is much larger than n + 1. For example, n + 1 = 4, then 4! / 2 = 24 / 2 = 12, which is greater than 4. Similarly, for n + 1 = 5, 5! / 2 = 60, which is way larger than 5. Therefore, there is no solution for n ≥ 3. Therefore, for n ≥ 3, m = (n + 1)! / k - 1 ≥ (n + 1)! / (n + 1) - 1 = n! - 1 ≥ 2! - 1 = 1, but for n ≥ 3, n! - 1 ≥ 2, so m ≥ 2. Therefore, (n + 1)! - k is composite.

Therefore, for n ≥ 3, each term in the sequence is composite, hence the sequence produces n consecutive composite integers.

Therefore, the problem might have a typo, and the correct statement is that for n ≥ 3, the sequence produces n consecutive composite integers. However, the original problem says "for n - 2". Maybe the original problem is in Chinese, and "n - 2" is a mistranslation of "for n ≥ 2", or "for n ≥ 3". Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the user is supposed to consider that when n is replaced by n - 2. But that seems unclear.

But given the problem as stated, maybe the user is supposed to assume that n is sufficiently large, or that n ≥ 3. Therefore, the answer is that each term in the sequence is composite because (n + 1)! - k is divisible by k, and since k is between 2 and n + 1, and for n ≥ 3, the term is at least 2 * 2 = 4, hence composite.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the sequence produces n consecutive composite integers for n ≥ 3, which is likely the intended meaning.

Hence, the answer is that each term (n + 1)! - k is composite because it is divisible by k, which is between 2 and n + 1, and for n ≥ 3, this ensures that each term is composite.

Therefore, the sequence produces n consecutive composite integers for n ≥ 3.

But since the problem says "for n - 2", maybe there's confusion here. However, given the problem as stated, I think the correct approach is to show that for n ≥ 3, the sequence is composite. Therefore, the answer is that the sequence produces n consecutive composite integers for n ≥ 3.

But since the problem says "for n - 2", maybe there is a different interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the user is supposed to consider that n - 2 is the number of terms? But the number of terms is n, as we saw.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that for n - 2, the sequence produces n consecutive composite numbers. But that would be confusing. Maybe the original problem is in another language and there was a translation error.

In any case, based on the reasoning, the key idea is that each term in the sequence is divisible by k, where k is between 2 and n + 1, and for n ≥ 3, this term is composite.

Therefore, the answer is that the sequence produces n consecutive composite integers for n ≥ 3. Hence, the problem likely has a typo, but the reasoning holds for n ≥ 3.

Therefore, the final answer is that the sequence produces n consecutive composite integers for n ≥ 3, which is the correct statement.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{n}
</think>

To establish that the sequence  
$$
(n + 1)! - 2, (n + 1)! - 3, \ldots, (n + 1)! - (n + 1)
$$  
produces **n consecutive composite integers**, we begin by analyzing the structure of the sequence.

---

### Step 1: Determine the Number of Terms

The sequence starts at $ (n+1)! - 2 $ and ends at $ (n+1)! - (n+1) $. The number of terms is:

$$
(n + 1) - 2 + 1 = n
$$

So, the sequence contains exactly **n terms**, as required.

---

### Step 2: General Term and Divisibility

Let $ k $ be an integer such that $ 2 \leq k \leq n + 1 $. Then the term in the sequence is:

$$
(n + 1)! - k
$$

Note that $ (n + 1)! $ is divisible by all integers from 1 to $ n + 1 $, so $ k $ divides $ (n + 1)! $. Therefore, we can write:

$$
(n + 1)! - k = k \cdot m
$$

for some integer $ m $, since:

$$
(n + 1)! - k = k \left( \frac{(n + 1)!}{k} - 1 \right)
$$

Hence, $ (n + 1)! - k $ is divisible by $ k $, and since $ k \geq 2 $, the term is a multiple of a number greater than 1.

---

### Step 3: Composite Nature of the Terms

Now, consider whether $ (n + 1)! - k $ is composite. Since $ k \geq 2 $ and $ (n + 1)! - k = k \cdot m $, the term is the product of two integers $ k $ and $ m $, both greater than 1 for $ n \geq 3 $.

- For $ n \geq 3 $, we have $ (n + 1)! \geq 4! = 24 $, so $ (n + 1)! - k \geq 24 - 4 = 20 $, which is clearly greater than 1.
- Also, $ k \geq 2 $, and $ m = \frac{(n + 1)!}{k} - 1 \geq \frac{n!}{k} - 1 \geq 1 $, so $ m \geq 1 $.

Therefore, for $ n \geq 3 $, $ (n + 1)! - k $ is a product of two integers $ k $ and $ m $, both at least 2, making it **composite**.

---

### Step 4: Edge Case: $ n = 2 $

For $ n = 2 $, the sequence is:

$$
(3)! - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4, \quad (3)! - 3 = 6 - 3 = 3
$$

So the sequence is $ 4, 3 $. Here, $ 3 $ is **prime**, so the sequence does **not** produce **n = 2** consecutive composite integers.

Hence, the sequence works for $ n \geq 3 $, but **fails** for $ n = 2 $.

---

### Final Conclusion

The sequence  
$$
(n + 1)! - 2, (n + 1)! - 3, \ldots, (n + 1)! - (n + 1)
$$  
produces **n consecutive composite integers** for all **integers $ n \geq 3 $**.

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{n}
