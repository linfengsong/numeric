Okay, so I need to show that for n > 1, every prime divisor of n! + 1 is an odd integer greater than n. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, let me recall what n! means. n! is the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n. So, n! = 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × n. Then n! + 1 is just that product plus one. The question is about the prime factors of this number. 

The problem says that every prime divisor of n! + 1 must be an odd integer greater than n. So, I need to prove two things: first, that any prime divisor of n! + 1 is odd, and second, that it's greater than n. Let me tackle them one by one.

Starting with the first part: showing that the prime divisor is odd. Well, n! is the product of numbers from 1 to n. If n is greater than 1, then n! is at least 2! = 2. So, n! is even when n ≥ 2. Therefore, n! is even, so n! + 1 is odd. Because even + 1 is odd. Therefore, n! + 1 is an odd number. 

Now, if a prime divides an odd number, then the prime itself must be odd. Because if a prime was even, it would have to be 2, but 2 divides an even number. However, since n! + 1 is odd, 2 cannot divide it. Therefore, all prime divisors of n! + 1 must be odd. So that takes care of the first part. 

Now, moving on to the second part: showing that every prime divisor is greater than n. Let me think. Suppose that p is a prime divisor of n! + 1. Then, p divides n! + 1, which means that n! ≡ -1 mod p. Therefore, n! ≡ -1 mod p. 

Alternatively, this can be written as (n!) ≡ -1 mod p. Which implies that (n!)^2 ≡ 1 mod p. Therefore, the order of n! modulo p divides 2. But maybe that's not the right direction. Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's suppose that p is a prime divisor of n! + 1. Then, n! ≡ -1 mod p. Therefore, if we consider the factorial n! modulo p, it's congruent to -1. 

But if p is a prime less than or equal to n, then p divides n! because n! is the product of numbers from 1 to n, which includes p. Therefore, n! ≡ 0 mod p. But according to our earlier statement, n! ≡ -1 mod p. Therefore, 0 ≡ -1 mod p, which implies that p divides 1. But that's impossible because p is a prime number greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, there is a contradiction. 

Therefore, our assumption that p is less than or equal to n must be wrong. Therefore, p must be greater than n. 

Wait, that seems like a solid argument. Let me check again. If p is a prime divisor of n! + 1, then p divides n! + 1, so n! ≡ -1 mod p. If p ≤ n, then p divides n! because n! is the product of numbers up to n, so p divides n! Hence, n! ≡ 0 mod p. But we have n! ≡ -1 mod p, so 0 ≡ -1 mod p, which implies that p divides 1, which is impossible. Therefore, p cannot be less than or equal to n. Therefore, p must be greater than n. 

Therefore, every prime divisor of n! + 1 is greater than n. 

But wait, the problem says "an odd integer that is greater than n". So, since we already showed that they are odd, and they are greater than n, that's the conclusion. 

But let me check with an example to make sure. Let's take n = 2. Then n! + 1 = 2! + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3. The prime divisor is 3, which is odd and greater than 2. That works. 

Another example: n = 3. 3! + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7. Prime divisor is 7, which is odd and greater than 3. 

n = 4: 4! + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25. The prime divisors are 5 and 5. 5 is odd and greater than 4. 

n = 5: 5! + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121. Which is 11². 11 is prime, odd, greater than 5. 

n = 6: 6! + 1 = 720 + 1 = 721. Let me check if 721 is prime or not. Divided by 7: 7*103 is 721? 7*100 is 700, 7*3 is 21, so 7*103 = 721. So 7 is a prime factor. Wait, but 7 is less than 6? No, 7 is greater than 6. Wait, n is 6, so 7 is greater than 6. So that's okay. Wait, 7 is a prime divisor, and it is greater than 6. So that works. 

Wait, but 7 divides 6! + 1. Let me check 6! is 720, 720 + 1 is 721. 721 divided by 7 is 103. So 7*103 is 721. 103 is also a prime. So both 7 and 103 are primes. 7 is greater than 6, and 103 is greater than 6. So that works. 

Another example, n = 5. 5! + 1 = 121, which is 11². 11 is greater than 5. 

Wait, but what if there is a prime divisor less than or equal to n? Suppose someone claims that for some n, there is a prime divisor p ≤ n. But according to the earlier logic, that would imply that p divides n! and p divides n! + 1, so p divides (n! + 1) - n! = 1. Which is impossible. Therefore, there can't be such a prime. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that all prime divisors of n! + 1 are greater than n and odd. 

But let me check another example. Let's take n = 7. 7! + 1 = 5040 + 1 = 5041. What is 5041? I think it's 71 squared. 71*71 is 5041. So 71 is a prime. 71 is greater than 7. 

Another example, n = 4. 25 is 5². 5 is prime, greater than 4. 

Wait, so seems like all examples check out. 

Therefore, the proof seems to be as follows: 

Suppose p is a prime divisor of n! + 1. Then, n! ≡ -1 mod p. If p ≤ n, then p divides n! (since n! is the product of numbers up to n, which includes p). Therefore, n! ≡ 0 mod p. But this contradicts n! ≡ -1 mod p. Therefore, p cannot be ≤ n. Therefore, p > n. Also, since n! is even (for n ≥ 2), n! + 1 is odd, so p must be odd. Therefore, all prime divisors of n! + 1 are odd integers greater than n. 

Therefore, that's the proof. 

But let me check if there's any possible case where p could be 2. For example, if n! + 1 is even. But n! is even for n ≥ 2, so n! + 1 is odd. Therefore, 2 cannot divide n! + 1. Therefore, there are no even prime divisors. Therefore, all prime divisors are odd. 

Therefore, the conclusion is correct. 

So, the answer is that every prime divisor of n! + 1 is an odd integer greater than n. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{p > n} where $ p $ is a prime divisor of $ n! + 1 $
</think>

To prove that **every prime divisor of $ n! + 1 $ is an odd integer greater than $ n $** for $ n > 1 $, we proceed in two parts: showing that such prime divisors must be **odd**, and that they must be **greater than $ n $**.

### **1. The Prime Divisors Are Odd**

We begin by considering the parity of $ n! + 1 $. 

- The factorial $ n! $ is the product of all integers from 1 to $ n $. For $ n \geq 2 $, this includes at least one even number, so $ n! $ is **even**.
- Therefore, $ n! + 1 $ is **odd** (since even + 1 = odd).

Now, if a prime $ p $ divides $ n! + 1 $, then $ p $ must divide an **odd** number. The only even prime is 2, but 2 cannot divide an odd number. Hence, **any prime divisor of $ n! + 1 $ must be odd**.

---

### **2. The Prime Divisors Are Greater Than $ n $**

Suppose $ p $ is a prime divisor of $ n! + 1 $. Then:

$$
n! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}
$$

Now, suppose for contradiction that $ p \leq n $. Then, since $ p $ is a prime less than or equal to $ n $, it divides $ n! $, because $ n! $ is the product of all integers from 1 to $ n $, and $ p $ is one of them. Therefore:

$$
n! \equiv 0 \pmod{p}
$$

But we also have:

$$
n! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}
$$

This is a contradiction because $ 0 \not\equiv -1 \pmod{p} $, unless $ p = 1 $, which is not a prime. Hence, our assumption that $ p \leq n $ must be false.

Therefore, **any prime divisor $ p $ of $ n! + 1 $ must be greater than $ n $**.

---

### **Conclusion**

Combining both parts:

- All prime divisors of $ n! + 1 $ are **odd** (since $ n! + 1 $ is odd).
- All such prime divisors are **greater than $ n $** (as shown by contradiction).

Thus, **every prime divisor of $ n! + 1 $ is an odd integer greater than $ n $**.

$$
\boxed{p > n}
