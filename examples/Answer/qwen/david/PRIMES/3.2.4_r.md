Okay, so I need to prove three statements about irrational numbers and roots. Let me start with part (a): proving that the square root of any prime number p is irrational. Hmm, I remember that this is a classic proof by contradiction. Let me recall the steps.

First, assume that √p is rational. Then, by definition, it can be expressed as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors (i.e., the fraction is in lowest terms). So, √p = a/b. If I square both sides, I get p = a²/b². Then, multiplying both sides by b² gives p*b² = a². 

Now, since p is prime, it must divide a². But if a prime divides a square, it must divide a itself. So, p divides a. Let me write a as p*k for some integer k. Then, substituting back into the equation: p*b² = (p*k)² = p²*k². Dividing both sides by p gives b² = p*k². 

So now, p divides b², which implies that p divides b. But wait, we initially assumed that a and b have no common factors. But if p divides both a and b, then they have a common factor of p, which contradicts the assumption that the fraction is in lowest terms. Therefore, our initial assumption that √p is rational must be false. Hence, √p is irrational. 

Let me check if this makes sense. For example, take p=2. Suppose √2 is rational, then 2 = a²/b², leading to a contradiction as shown. Similarly for any prime. So, this seems correct. 

Moving on to part (b): If a is a positive integer and the nth root of a is rational, then the nth root of a must be an integer. 

Okay, so let's suppose that √[n]{a} is rational. Then, it can be written as a fraction c/d where c and d are coprime integers. So, √[n]{a} = c/d. Raising both sides to the nth power gives a = c^n / d^n. Therefore, multiplying both sides by d^n, we get a*d^n = c^n. 

Since c and d are coprime, their nth powers are also coprime. Therefore, d^n must divide 1, because a*d^n = c^n, and since c^n and d^n are coprime, d^n must divide a? Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.

Wait, if a*d^n = c^n, then since c and d are coprime, d^n divides a. Because if d^n divides c^n, but since gcd(c, d) = 1, then d^n divides 1. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again.

Let me recall that if two numbers are coprime, then any prime factor of one doesn't divide the other. So, if c and d are coprime, then c^n and d^n are coprime as well. Therefore, in the equation a*d^n = c^n, since d^n divides c^n, and gcd(c^n, d^n) = 1, then d^n must divide 1. Therefore, d^n = 1, which implies that d = 1. Therefore, √[n]{a} = c/1 = c, which is an integer. 

Therefore, √[n]{a} must be an integer. That seems right. Let me check with an example. Suppose a=8 and n=3. Then √[3]{8} = 2, which is integer. If a=2 and n=2, √2 is irrational, so that's covered. If a=4 and n=2, √4=2, which is integer. So, if √[n]{a} is rational, then it must be integer. 

So, that seems to hold. Therefore, part (b) is proven. 

Now part (c): For n ≥ 2, the nth root of n is irrational. 

So, need to show that √[n]{n} is irrational for any integer n ≥ 2. 

Hmm, similar to part (a), but here the number under the root is n, which is not necessarily prime. However, maybe we can use similar techniques. Let me try.

Assume that √[n]{n} is rational. Then, √[n]{n} = a/b where a and b are coprime integers. Then, raising both sides to the nth power gives n = a^n / b^n. Therefore, multiplying both sides by b^n gives n*b^n = a^n. 

So, n divides a^n. Since n is an integer ≥ 2, let's consider its prime factors. Suppose that n has a prime factor p. Then, p divides a^n, so p divides a. Let me write a = p*k. Then, substituting back into the equation: n*b^n = (p*k)^n = p^n * k^n. Therefore, n divides p^n * k^n. 

But since n is a positive integer, and p is a prime factor of n, let me think. Let me consider the prime factors of n. Let me suppose that n is not a perfect nth power. Wait, but how do I proceed? Maybe I need to use the fact that if n divides a^n, then all prime factors of n must divide a. But since a and b are coprime, then b must divide 1? Wait, similar to part (b). Let me try again.

From n*b^n = a^n, since a and b are coprime, then b^n divides 1? Wait, no. Wait, if n*b^n = a^n, and gcd(a, b) = 1, then b^n divides n? Wait, not sure. Let me think.

Since a and b are coprime, then any prime factor of b cannot divide a. Therefore, in the equation n*b^n = a^n, since b^n divides a^n, but gcd(b, a) = 1, then b^n must divide 1. Therefore, b^n = 1, so b = 1. Therefore, n = a^n. Therefore, a^n = n. Therefore, a must be an integer such that a^n = n. 

But for n ≥ 2, is there an integer a such that a^n = n? For example, n=2, a^2=2, which would imply a=√2, which is irrational. Similarly, n=3, a^3=3, which is irrational. For n=4, a^4=4, which would be √2, irrational. So, in this case, if we suppose that √[n]{n} is rational, then it would have to be an integer a such that a^n = n. However, for n ≥ 2, the only possible integer a would be 1 or greater. But 1^n = 1, so if n=1, but n ≥ 2. Therefore, there is no integer a with a^n = n for n ≥ 2. Therefore, our assumption that √[n]{n} is rational is false. Hence, √[n]{n} is irrational. 

Wait, but this seems similar to part (b). However, in part (b), we had that if √[n]{a} is rational, then it must be integer. Here, we are trying to show that √[n]{n} is irrational. So, the same logic applies: if √[n]{n} is rational, then it must be integer, but there is no integer a with a^n = n for n ≥ 2. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, √[n]{n} is irrational. 

But let me check for n=1. Wait, n ≥ 2, so n=2, 3,... So, for n=2, √2 is irrational, as we know. For n=4, √4=2 is rational, but wait, hold on. Wait, n=4, √[4]{4} is 4^(1/4) = (2^2)^(1/4) = 2^(1/2) = √2, which is irrational. Wait, but if n=4, then √[4]{4} is irrational. However, if n=16, √[4]{16} = 2, which is rational. Wait, but n=16, which is 2^4. So, in this case, √[4]{16} is 2. So, that would be rational. But according to our previous reasoning, if we suppose that √[n]{n} is rational, then it must be integer a such that a^n = n. For n=16, a^4 = 16. Then a=2, since 2^4=16. Therefore, √[4]{16} is 2, which is rational. But according to our problem statement, part (c) says that for n ≥ 2, √[n]{n} is irrational. But in this case, n=16, √[4]{16} is rational. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Wait, so my reasoning must be wrong. 

Wait, hold on. The problem says "for n ≥ 2, √[n]{n} is irrational." But in the case of n=16 and n=4, √[4]{16} is 2, which is rational. However, in this case, n is 16, and the root is 4th root. Wait, but the problem says √[n]{n}, so for n=16, it's the 16th root of 16. Which is 16^(1/16). Which is equal to e^(ln(16)/16) ≈ something. But 16^(1/16) is equal to 2^(4/16) = 2^(1/4) which is irrational. Wait, but if you take the 4th root of 16, that is 2, but that is √[4]{16} which is different from √[16]{16}. 

Ah! Wait, the problem says √[n]{n}, so for n=16, it is the 16th root of 16, not the 4th root. Therefore, √[16]{16} is 16^(1/16) = (2^4)^(1/16) = 2^(4/16) = 2^(1/4), which is irrational. Therefore, even though 16 is a perfect 4th power, the 16th root of 16 is irrational. Therefore, my previous example was incorrect. 

So, let me think again. Suppose that n is a perfect nth power. For example, if n = k^n, then √[n]{n} = k. But in that case, n = k^n. For example, if n=16, k=2, then 2^4 = 16. But if we take the 16th root of 16, that is 16^(1/16) = 2^(4/16) = 2^(1/4), which is irrational. Therefore, even if n is a perfect power, the nth root of n is not necessarily rational. Therefore, the problem is correct in stating that √[n]{n} is irrational for n ≥ 2. 

Wait, but if n is a perfect nth power, then n = m^n, so m^n = n. Therefore, if m is an integer, then m^n = n. For example, m=2, n=2: 2^2=4, which is not equal to n=2. m=2, n=4: 2^4=16, which is not equal to n=4. Wait, so in order to have m^n = n, we need m^n = n. For n ≥ 2, the only possible solution is m=1, which gives 1^n = 1, which is not equal to n ≥ 2. Therefore, there is no integer m such that m^n = n for n ≥ 2. Therefore, √[n]{n} cannot be an integer, so if it is rational, it must be a fraction. But earlier, we had that if √[n]{n} is rational, then it must be integer, which would lead to a contradiction. Therefore, √[n]{n} is irrational. 

Therefore, part (c) is proven. 

But let me check with n=2: √2 is irrational. n=3: √[3]{3} is irrational. n=4: √[4]{4} is √2, irrational. n=5: √[5]{5} is irrational. For n=16, √[16]{16} is 2^(1/4), irrational. So, seems correct. 

Wait, but let me check n=1. But the problem says n ≥ 2, so n=1 is excluded. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that √[n]{n} is irrational for all n ≥ 2. 

Therefore, all three parts are proven. 

But let me just check part (c) again. Suppose someone says that if n is a perfect square, say n = k^2, then √[n]{n} = √[k^2]{k^2} = k^(2/2) = k, which is integer. Wait, but that would be if n = k^2, then √[n]{n} is k. But in that case, n = k^2. So, for example, if n=4, then √[4]{4} is 4^(1/4) = √2, which is irrational. Wait, but that contradicts the previous statement. Wait, what's the problem here?

Wait, if n is k^2, then √[n]{n} is √[k^2]{k^2} = k^(2/2) = k. Wait, but that would be k. However, √[k^2]{k^2} is equal to (k^2)^(1/k^2) = k^(2/k^2). Which is only equal to k if 2/k^2 = 1, which would mean k^2 = 2, so k = √2, which is not integer. Therefore, my mistake was in thinking that √[n]{n} is k if n = k^2. Actually, that's not correct. 

Wait, let me clarify. Let me take n = k^2. Then, √[n]{n} is n^(1/n) = (k^2)^(1/k^2) = k^(2/k^2). Which is not equal to k unless 2/k^2 = 1, which is not possible for integer k ≥ 2. Therefore, √[n]{n} is not equal to k. Therefore, my previous reasoning was wrong. Therefore, even if n is a perfect square, √[n]{n} is not an integer. Therefore, the conclusion that √[n]{n} is irrational holds. 

Therefore, in part (c), the key is that if √[n]{n} is rational, then it must be integer, but there is no integer a with a^n = n for n ≥ 2. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, √[n]{n} is irrational. 

Therefore, all three parts are proven. 

Let me recap:

(a) Assume √p is rational, then p = a²/b², leading to p divides a and b, contradiction. 

(b) Assume √[n]{a} is rational, then a = c^n / d^n, leading to d^n = 1, so c/d is integer. 

(c) Assume √[n]{n} is rational, then n = a^n / b^n, leading to b^n = 1, so a^n = n, which has no solution for n ≥ 2. 

Therefore, all parts are proven. 

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. 

**Final Answer**

(a) $\boxed{\sqrt{p}}$ is irrational for any prime $p$.

(b) $\boxed{\sqrt[n]{a}}$ must be an integer if $a$ is a positive integer and $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is rational.

(c) $\boxed{\sqrt[n]{n}}$ is irrational for $n \geq 2$.

To establish the three facts, we use a combination of **proof by contradiction** and **properties of rational and irrational numbers**, particularly focusing on the implications of rationality for roots of integers.

### **(a) $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational for any prime $p$.**

**Proof:**

Assume, for contradiction, that $\sqrt{p}$ is rational. Then, it can be expressed as a fraction in lowest terms:

$$
\sqrt{p} = \frac{a}{b}, \quad \text{where } a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, \gcd(a, b) = 1.
$$

Squaring both sides:

$$
p = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \Rightarrow p b^2 = a^2.
$$

This implies that $p$ divides $a^2$. Since $p$ is prime, it must divide $a$. Let $a = p k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting back:

$$
p b^2 = (p k)^2 = p^2 k^2 \Rightarrow b^2 = p k^2.
$$

This implies that $p$ divides $b^2$, and hence $p$ divides $b$. But this contradicts the assumption that $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, since both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by $p$.

Thus, our assumption that $\sqrt{p}$ is rational is false. Therefore, $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational.

$$
\boxed{\sqrt{p}} \text{ is irrational for any prime } p.
$$

### **(b) If $a$ is a positive integer and $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is rational, then $\sqrt[n]{a}$ must be an integer.**

**Proof:**

Assume $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is rational. Then, it can be written as:

$$
\sqrt[n]{a} = \frac{c}{d}, \quad \text{where } c, d \in \mathbb{Z}, \gcd(c, d) = 1.
$$

Raising both sides to the $n$-th power:

$$
a = \left(\frac{c}{d}\right)^n = \frac{c^n}{d^n} \Rightarrow a d^n = c^n.
$$

Since $\gcd(c, d) = 1$, it follows that $\gcd(c^n, d^n) = 1$. Thus, $d^n$ divides 1, which implies $d = 1$.

Therefore, $\sqrt[n]{a} = c$, so $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is an integer.

$$
\boxed{\sqrt[n]{a}} \text{ must be an integer if } a \text{ is a positive integer and } \sqrt[n]{a} \text{ is rational.}
$$

---

### **(c) For $n \geq 2$, $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is irrational.**

**Proof:**

Assume, for contradiction, that $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is rational. Then:

$$
\sqrt[n]{n} = \frac{a}{b}, \quad \text{where } a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, \gcd(a, b) = 1.
$$

Raising both sides to the $n$-th power:

$$
n = \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n} \Rightarrow n b^n = a^n.
$$

Since $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, it follows that $\gcd(a^n, b^n) = 1$. Thus, $b^n$ divides 1, so $b = 1$.

Therefore, $\sqrt[n]{n} = a$, so $a^n = n$. However, for $n \geq 2$, there is no integer $a$ such that $a^n = n$, because:

- $a = 1 \Rightarrow a^n = 1 \neq n$,
- $a \geq 2 \Rightarrow a^n \geq 2^n > n$ for $n \geq 2$.

Thus, no such integer $a$ exists, and the assumption that $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is rational is false. Therefore, $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is irrational.

$$
\boxed{\sqrt[n]{n}} \text{ is irrational for } n \geq 2.
$$

---

### **Final Answers:**

(a) $\boxed{\sqrt{p}}$ is irrational for any prime $p$.  
(b) $\boxed{\sqrt[n]{a}}$ must be an integer if $a$ is a positive integer and $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is rational.  
(c) $\boxed{\sqrt[n]{n}}$ is irrational for $n \geq 2$.
