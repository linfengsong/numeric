Okay, let me try to figure out how to find a prime divisor of these numbers N that's of the form 4n + 3. First, let me understand the problem. I need to take N = 4*(3*7*11) - 1 and find a prime divisor of that number which is congruent to 3 mod 4. Then do the same for N = 4*(3*7*11*15) - 1. 

Starting with the first one: N = 4*(3*7*11) - 1. Let me compute that value first. Let me calculate 3*7 first. 3*7 is 21. Then 21*11. Let me compute that: 21*10 is 210, plus 21 is 231. So 3*7*11 is 231. Then multiply by 4: 231*4. Let me do that: 200*4 is 800, 30*4 is 120, 1*4 is 4. So 800 + 120 is 920, plus 4 is 924. Then subtract 1: 924 - 1 = 923. So N is 923. Now I need to find a prime divisor of 923 that is congruent to 3 mod 4.

First, let me check if 923 is prime. If it is, then it's the only prime divisor, and I need to check if it's 4n + 3. But I don't think it's prime. Let me try dividing by small primes. Let's see: 923 divided by 2? No, it's odd. Divided by 3? Let me check the sum of digits: 9 + 2 + 3 = 14. 14 isn't divisible by 3, so no. Divided by 5? Ends with 3, so no. Divided by 7? Let me do 7*131 is 917, 7*132 is 924. So 923 - 924 is -1, so 923 divided by 7 is 131.85... So not divisible by 7. How about 11? Let me check the alternating sum: 9 - 2 + 3 = 10, which isn't divisible by 11. So not divisible by 11. Next prime is 13. Let me try 13*70 = 910. 923 - 910 = 13. So 13*71 = 923? Wait, 13*70 is 910, 13*71 is 910 + 13 = 923. Yes! So 13*71 = 923. So the prime factors are 13 and 71. Now check if these are congruent to 3 mod 4.

First, 13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 13 ≡ 1 mod 4. Then 71 divided by 4 is 17*4 = 68, remainder 3. So 71 ≡ 3 mod 4. Therefore, 71 is a prime divisor of N = 923 of the form 4n + 3. So that's the answer for the first part.

Now moving on to the second part: N = 4*(3*7*11*15) - 1. Let me compute that. First, compute the product inside the parentheses: 3*7*11*15. Let me compute step by step. 3*7 is 21, then 21*11 is 231, then 231*15. Let me compute that. 231*10 is 2310, 231*5 is 1155, so total is 2310 + 1155 = 3465. Then multiply by 4: 3465*4. Let me compute that: 3000*4 = 12000, 400*4=1600, 65*4=260. So 12000 + 1600 = 13600, plus 260 is 13860. Then subtract 1: 13860 - 1 = 13859. So N is 13859. Now I need to find a prime divisor of 13859 that is congruent to 3 mod 4.

First, check if 13859 is prime. If not, factor it. Let me try dividing by small primes. First, check if it's even? No, it's odd. Divisible by 3? Let me check the sum of digits: 1 + 3 + 8 + 5 + 9 = 26. 26 isn't divisible by 3. Divisible by 5? Ends with 9, so no. Divisible by 7? Let me try dividing 13859 by 7. 7*1979 is 13853, since 7*2000 is 14000, subtract 7*21 = 147, so 14000 - 147 = 13853. Then 13859 - 13853 = 6. So remainder 6. Not divisible by 7. Next prime is 11. Let me check the alternating sum: 1 - 3 + 8 - 5 + 9 = (1 - 3) + (8 - 5) + 9 = (-2) + 3 + 9 = 10. Not divisible by 11. Next prime is 13. Let me try dividing 13859 by 13. Let me compute 13*1000 = 13000. 13859 - 13000 = 859. Now divide 859 by 13. 13*60 = 780. 859 - 780 = 79. 79 divided by 13 is 6 with remainder 1. So total is 1000 + 60 + 6 = 1066 with remainder 1. Not divisible by 13.

Next prime is 17. Let me try dividing 13859 by 17. Let me compute 17*800 = 13600. 13859 - 13600 = 259. Now divide 259 by 17: 17*15 = 255. 259 - 255 = 4. So remainder 4. Not divisible by 17. Next prime is 19. Let me try 19*700 = 13300. 13859 - 13300 = 559. Now divide 559 by 19. 19*29 = 551. 559 - 551 = 8. Not divisible by 19. Next prime is 23. Let me try 23*600 = 13800. 13859 - 13800 = 59. 59 divided by 23 is 2 with remainder 13. Not divisible by 23. Next prime is 29. Let me try 29*477 = ? Wait, maybe another approach. Let me check if 13859 is divisible by 29. Let me compute 29*477. Wait, maybe it's easier to do division. Let me try 29*477: 29*(400 + 77) = 29*400 + 29*77 = 11600 + 2233 = 13833. Then 13859 - 13833 = 26. Not divisible by 29. Next prime is 31. Let me try 31*447 = ? Let me see, 31*400 = 12400, 31*47 = 1457, so total is 12400 + 1457 = 13857. Then 13859 - 13857 = 2. Not divisible by 31. Next prime is 37. Let me try dividing 13859 by 37. Let me compute 37*374 = 37*(300 + 74) = 11100 + 2738 = 13838. Then 13859 - 13838 = 21. Not divisible by 37. Next prime is 41. Let me try 41*338 = 41*(300 + 38) = 12300 + 1558 = 13858. Then 13859 - 13858 = 1. Not divisible by 41. Next prime is 43. Let me try 43*322 = 43*(300 + 22) = 12900 + 946 = 13846. Then 13859 - 13846 = 13. Not divisible by 43. Next prime is 47. Let me try 47*294 = 47*(200 + 94) = 9400 + 4418 = 13818. Then 13859 - 13818 = 41. Not divisible by 47. Next prime is 53. Let me try 53*261 = 53*(260 + 1) = 53*260 + 53 = 13780 + 53 = 13833. Then 13859 - 13833 = 26. Not divisible by 53. Next prime is 59. Let me try 59*234 = 59*(200 + 34) = 11800 + 2006 = 13806. Then 13859 - 13806 = 53. Not divisible by 59. Next prime is 61. Let me try 61*227 = 61*(200 + 27) = 12200 + 1647 = 13847. Then 13859 - 13847 = 12. Not divisible by 61. Next prime is 67. Let me try 67*206 = 67*(200 + 6) = 13400 + 402 = 13802. Then 13859 - 13802 = 57. 57 is divisible by 3 and 19, but 67 doesn't divide 57. Next prime is 71. Let me try 71*195 = 71*(200 - 5) = 14200 - 355 = 13845. Then 13859 - 13845 = 14. Not divisible by 71. Next prime is 73. Let me try 73*189 = 73*(180 + 9) = 13140 + 657 = 13797. 13859 - 13797 = 62. Not divisible by 73. Next prime is 79. Let me try 79*175 = 79*(170 + 5) = 13430 + 395 = 13825. Then 13859 - 13825 = 34. Not divisible by 79. Next prime is 83. Let me try 83*167 = 83*(160 + 7) = 13280 + 581 = 13861. That's 1 more than 13859. So 83*167 - 2 = 13859. Therefore, not divisible by 83. Next prime is 89. Let me try 89*155 = 89*(150 + 5) = 13350 + 445 = 13795. Then 13859 - 13795 = 64. Not divisible by 89. Next prime is 97. Let me try 97*142 = 97*(140 + 2) = 13580 + 194 = 13774. Then 13859 - 13774 = 85. 85 is 5*17, so not divisible by 97. Hmm, this is taking a while. Maybe I need a better approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some number theory to find a prime divisor of the form 4n + 3. Let me think about the structure of N. For the first case, N was 4*(product of three primes) - 1. For the second case, N is 4*(product of four numbers: 3, 7, 11, 15) - 1. Wait, but 15 is not prime. Wait, 3, 7, 11 are primes, but 15 is 3*5. So maybe the product is 3*7*11*15 = 3*7*11*3*5 = 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11. So N = 4*(3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11) - 1. 

But maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think about the first case: N = 4*(3*7*11) - 1. The prime factors were 13 and 71. 13 is 1 mod 4, 71 is 3 mod 4. For the second case, maybe there's a similar structure? Let me think. Maybe I need to check if 13859 is prime? But I don't know. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find a prime divisor of the form 4n + 3. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that N = 4*(product) - 1. Let me think about the product. For the first case, the product was 3*7*11. Let me check if there's a relation between the product and the prime divisors. But maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that if N has a prime divisor p ≡ 3 mod 4, then certain conditions must hold. 

Alternatively, maybe I can check if N is congruent to something mod 4. Let me check N for the second case. N = 4*(something) - 1. So 4*(something) is 0 mod 4, so N ≡ -1 mod 4, which is 3 mod 4. Therefore, N is congruent to 3 mod 4. Therefore, any prime divisor of N must be congruent to 3 mod 4 or 1 mod 4. But since N ≡ 3 mod 4, then if it has a prime divisor p, then p ≡ 3 mod 4 or p ≡ 1 mod 4. However, if N has a prime divisor p ≡ 1 mod 4, then there might be other primes. But since N is 3 mod 4, if it has only prime factors ≡ 1 mod 4, then the number of such primes would have to be odd. But maybe not. However, since we need to find at least one prime divisor of the form 4n + 3, perhaps there is one.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 3, 7, 11, 15 are numbers. Wait, 3, 7, 11 are primes, but 15 is 3*5. Maybe there's a connection here. Let me think. Let me check if 13859 is divisible by 3? Wait, earlier I checked the sum of digits was 26, which isn't divisible by 3. So no. Divisible by 5? Ends with 9, no. Divisible by 7? Earlier tried and got remainder 6. Divisible by 11? Alternating sum was 10, no. Divisible by 13? No. Divisible by 17? No. Divisible by 19? No. Divisible by 23? No. Divisible by 29? No. Divisible by 31? No. Divisible by 37? No. Divisible by 41? No. Divisible by 43? No. Divisible by 47? No. Divisible by 53? No. Divisible by 59? No. Divisible by 61? No. Divisible by 67? No. Divisible by 71? No. Divisible by 73? No. Divisible by 79? No. Divisible by 83? No. Divisible by 89? No. Divisible by 97? No. Maybe I need to check higher primes. Alternatively, maybe I can check if 13859 is a prime. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can check if 13859 is a prime by checking primes up to sqrt(13859). Let me compute sqrt(13859). Well, 117^2 is 13689, 118^2 is 13924. So sqrt(13859) is between 117 and 118. Therefore, I need to check primes up to 117. So I need to check primes up to 117. I have already checked up to 97. Let me continue.

Next prime after 97 is 101. Let me check 13859 divided by 101. Let me compute 101*137 = 101*(130 + 7) = 13130 + 707 = 13837. Then 13859 - 13837 = 22. Not divisible by 101. Next prime is 103. Let me try 103*134 = 103*(130 + 4) = 13390 + 412 = 13802. Then 13859 - 13802 = 57. Not divisible by 103. Next prime is 107. Let me try 107*129 = 107*(130 - 1) = 13910 - 107 = 13803. Then 13859 - 13803 = 56. Not divisible by 107. Next prime is 109. Let me try 109*127 = 109*(120 + 7) = 13080 + 763 = 13843. Then 13859 - 13843 = 16. Not divisible by 109. Next prime is 113. Let me try 113*122 = 113*(120 + 2) = 13560 + 226 = 13786. Then 13859 - 13786 = 73. Not divisible by 113. Next prime is 127, but wait, sqrt(13859) is about 117.7, so 127 is larger. So the next prime after 113 is 113, then 127 is beyond. Therefore, since I have checked all primes up to 113, and none divide 13859, then 13859 is a prime? Wait, but 13859 is a prime? Wait, but let me check 13859 divided by 113. Wait, 113*122 = 13786. Then 113*123 = 13786 + 113 = 13899, which is larger than 13859. So between 122 and 123. Therefore, no. Therefore, if none of the primes up to 113 divide 13859, then 13859 is prime. Wait, but let me check 13859 divided by 7, 13, etc. Wait, earlier I checked up to 113, and none divided it. So maybe 13859 is prime? But that seems unlikely because the problem says to find a prime divisor of the form 4n + 3. If it is prime, then it must be of the form 4n + 3. Let me check 13859 mod 4. Since N was 4*(something) - 1, so N ≡ -1 mod 4, which is 3 mod 4. Therefore, if 13859 is prime, then it is congruent to 3 mod 4. Let me check 13859 divided by 4: 4*3464 = 13856, so 13859 - 13856 = 3. Therefore, 13859 ≡ 3 mod 4. Therefore, if 13859 is prime, then it is a prime divisor of the form 4n + 3. Therefore, maybe that's the answer? But wait, the problem says "Find a prime divisor...", so if N is prime, then that's the only prime divisor, which is 4n + 3. But maybe I made a mistake in my earlier calculations? Let me check if 13859 is actually prime. Maybe I missed a prime factor.

Alternatively, maybe I can check with another method. Let me try dividing by 7 again. 7*1979 = 13853. 13859 - 13853 = 6. Not divisible by 7. How about 13? 13*1066 = 13858. 13859 - 13858 = 1. Not divisible. How about 17? 17*815 = 13855. 13859 - 13855 = 4. Not divisible. How about 19? 19*729 = 13851. 13859 - 13851 = 8. Not divisible. 23? 23*602 = 13846. 13859 - 13846 = 13. Not divisible. 29? 29*477 = 13833. 13859 - 13833 = 26. Not divisible. 31? 31*447 = 13857. 13859 - 13857 = 2. Not divisible. 37? 37*374 = 13838. 13859 - 13838 = 21. Not divisible. 41? 41*338 = 13858. 13859 - 13858 = 1. Not divisible. 43? 43*322 = 13846. 13859 - 13846 = 13. Not divisible. 47? 47*294 = 13818. 13859 - 13818 = 41. Not divisible. 53? 53*261 = 13833. 13859 - 13833 = 26. Not divisible. 59? 59*234 = 13806. 13859 - 13806 = 53. Not divisible. 61? 61*227 = 13847. 13859 - 13847 = 12. Not divisible. 67? 67*206 = 13802. 13859 - 13802 = 57. Not divisible. 71? 71*195 = 13845. 13859 - 13845 = 14. Not divisible. 73? 73*189 = 13797. 13859 - 13797 = 62. Not divisible. 79? 79*175 = 13825. 13859 - 13825 = 34. Not divisible. 83? 83*167 = 13861. Which is 2 more than 13859. Not divisible. 89? 89*155 = 13795. 13859 - 13795 = 64. Not divisible. 97? 97*142 = 13774. 13859 - 13774 = 85. Not divisible. 101? 101*137 = 13837. 13859 - 13837 = 22. Not divisible. 103? 103*134 = 13802. 13859 - 13802 = 57. Not divisible. 107? 107*129 = 13803. 13859 - 13803 = 56. Not divisible. 109? 109*127 = 13843. 13859 - 13843 = 16. Not divisible. 113? 113*122 = 13786. 13859 - 13786 = 73. Not divisible. 

So, after checking all primes up to 113, none divide 13859, so 13859 is a prime number. Therefore, the only prime divisor is 13859 itself, which is congruent to 3 mod 4. Therefore, the answer for the second part is 13859. 

But wait, that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me check with another approach. Maybe there's a mistake in my calculation. Let me check if 13859 is indeed prime. Let me try dividing by 7 again. 7*1979 = 13853. 13859 - 13853 = 6. Not divisible. How about 13? 13*1066 = 13858. 13859 - 13858 = 1. Not divisible. How about 17? 17*815 = 13855. 13859 - 13855 = 4. Not divisible. 19? 19*729 = 13851. 13859 - 13851 = 8. Not divisible. 23? 23*602 = 13846. 13859 - 13846 = 13. Not divisible. 29? 29*477 = 13833. 13859 - 13833 = 26. Not divisible. 31? 31*447 = 13857. 13859 - 13857 = 2. Not divisible. 37? 37*374 = 13838. 13859 - 13838 = 21. Not divisible. 41? 41*338 = 13858. 13859 - 13858 = 1. Not divisible. 43? 43*322 = 13846. 13859 - 13846 = 13. Not divisible. 47? 47*294 = 13818. 13859 - 13818 = 41. Not divisible. 53? 53*261 = 13833. 13859 - 13833 = 26. Not divisible. 59? 59*234 = 13806. 13859 - 13806 = 53. Not divisible. 61? 61*227 = 13847. 13859 - 13847 = 12. Not divisible. 67? 67*206 = 13802. 13859 - 13802 = 57. Not divisible. 71? 71*195 = 13845. 13859 - 13845 = 14. Not divisible. 73? 73*189 = 13797. 13859 - 13797 = 62. Not divisible. 79? 79*175 = 13825. 13859 - 13825 = 34. Not divisible. 83? 83*167 = 13861. Which is 2 more than 13859. Not divisible. 89? 89*155 = 13795. 13859 - 13795 = 64. Not divisible. 97? 97*142 = 13774. 13859 - 13774 = 85. Not divisible. 101? 101*137 = 13837. 13859 - 13837 = 22. Not divisible. 103? 103*134 = 13802. 13859 - 13802 = 57. Not divisible. 107? 107*129 = 13803. 13859 - 13803 = 56. Not divisible. 109? 109*127 = 13843. 13859 - 13843 = 16. Not divisible. 113? 113*122 = 13786. 13859 - 13786 = 73. Not divisible. 

Therefore, after checking all primes up to sqrt(13859) ≈ 117.7, none divide 13859. Therefore, 13859 is a prime number. Therefore, the prime divisor is 13859 itself, which is congruent to 3 mod 4. Therefore, the answer for the second part is 13859.

But let me check again if I did the calculation correctly for N. The original N was 4*(3*7*11*15) - 1. Let me recompute that. 3*7 is 21, 21*11 is 231, 231*15. Let me compute 231*15. 200*15 = 3000, 30*15=450, 1*15=15. So total is 3000 + 450 + 15 = 3465. Then 4*3465 is 13860. Then subtract 1, so 13860 - 1 = 13859. Yes, that's correct. So N is indeed 13859. And since 13859 is prime, and congruent to 3 mod 4, that is the prime divisor. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to find such a prime divisor without computing the entire number. Let me think. For the first case, N was 4*(product of primes) - 1, and we found a prime divisor of the form 4n + 3. Maybe there's a pattern here. For example, maybe the prime divisor is related to the product? But I don't see it immediately. 

Alternatively, maybe using modular arithmetic. Let me think. For the first case, N = 4*(3*7*11) - 1 = 923. We found that 71 divides it. 71 ≡ 3 mod 4. For the second case, N = 4*(3*7*11*15) - 1 = 13859, which is prime. But since 13859 ≡ 3 mod 4, that's the answer. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a general approach. Suppose we have N = 4*(product of numbers) - 1. If the product is such that it has certain properties, maybe we can find a prime divisor of the form 4n + 3. But I think in this case, for the second N, since the product includes 3, 7, 11, 15, which includes multiple numbers, and when multiplied by 4 and subtracted by 1, the result is prime. Therefore, the answer is that prime itself.

Therefore, the answers are 71 for the first N and 13859 for the second N.

But let me check once more for the second N. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming it's prime? Let me check with another method. Let me check if 13859 is a prime using another approach. For example, check if it's a known prime or use some primality test. But since I can't do that here, I need to rely on my previous calculations. Since I checked all primes up to sqrt(13859), and none divide it, then it's prime. Therefore, the answer is 13859.

So, in conclusion:

For N = 4*(3*7*11) - 1 = 923, the prime divisor of the form 4n + 3 is 71.

For N = 4*(3*7*11*15) - 1 = 13859, the prime divisor of the form 4n + 3 is 13859 itself.

Therefore, the answers are 71 and 13859.

**Final Answer**
For the first integer, the prime divisor is \boxed{71}, and for the second integer, it is \boxed{13859}.

To solve the problem, we are given two expressions:

1. $ N_1 = 4(3 \cdot 7 \cdot 11) - 1 $
2. $ N_2 = 4(3 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 15) - 1 $

We are asked to find a **prime divisor** of each of these integers that is of the form $ 4n + 3 $.

### **Step 1: Compute $ N_1 $ and find its prime divisors**

**Compute $ N_1 $:**

$$
N_1 = 4(3 \cdot 7 \cdot 11) - 1 = 4(231) - 1 = 924 - 1 = 923
$$

**Factor 923:**

We test divisibility of 923 by small primes:

- $ 923 \div 13 = 71 $, and $ 13 \times 71 = 923 $

So, the prime factorization of 923 is $ 13 \times 71 $.

Check the congruence modulo 4:

- $ 13 \equiv 1 \mod 4 $
- $ 71 \equiv 3 \mod 4 $

Thus, the prime divisor of the form $ 4n + 3 $ is:

$$
\boxed{71}
$$

### **Step 2: Compute $ N_2 $ and find its prime divisors**

**Compute $ N_2 $:**

$$
N_2 = 4(3 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 15) - 1
$$

First, compute the product:

$$
3 \cdot 7 = 21,\quad 21 \cdot 11 = 231,\quad 231 \cdot 15 = 3465
$$

$$
N_2 = 4 \cdot 3465 - 1 = 13860 - 1 = 13859
$$

**Check if 13859 is prime:**

We test divisibility by all primes up to $ \sqrt{13859} \approx 117.7 $. After testing all primes up to 113 (and none divide 13859), we conclude that 13859 is a **prime number**.

Now check its congruence modulo 4:

$$
13859 \div 4 = 3464 \text{ remainder } 3 \Rightarrow 13859 \equiv 3 \mod 4
$$

Thus, the only prime divisor of 13859 is itself, and it is of the form $ 4n + 3 $.

$$
\boxed{13859}
$$

### **Final Answers**

- For $ N = 4(3 \cdot 7 \cdot 11) - 1 $, the prime divisor of the form $ 4n + 3 $ is $ \boxed{71} $
- For $ N = 4(3 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 15) - 1 $, the prime divisor of the form $ 4n + 3 $ is $ \boxed{13859} $
