Okay, so I need to show that any composite three-digit number must have a prime factor less than or equal to 31. Hmm, let's start by recalling what a composite number is. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. So, if a number is composite, it can be factored into smaller numbers, right?

First, let me think about the range of three-digit numbers. The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. So, we're dealing with numbers from 100 to 999 inclusive. The task is to prove that any number in this range that's composite must have a prime factor ≤ 31. 

Maybe I can approach this by contradiction? Suppose there's a composite three-digit number that doesn't have any prime factors less than or equal to 31. Then, all its prime factors would be greater than 31. If that's the case, then the number would be the product of primes each greater than 31. Let me think about how big such a product would be.

First, let's note that the primes greater than 31 and less than or equal to 999 (since the number itself is three digits). The primes greater than 31 would start from 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, etc. Let me check the primes up to 999, but maybe I don't need all of them.

If a composite number is the product of two primes, both greater than 31, then the smallest such product would be 37*37. Let me calculate that: 37*37 is 1369. But 1369 is a four-digit number, which is larger than 999. Therefore, the product of two primes greater than 31 is already larger than 999. Therefore, there can't be a composite three-digit number that is the product of two primes greater than 31. 

But wait, what if the composite number has more than two prime factors? For example, three primes? Let's check. The smallest product of three primes greater than 31 would be 37*37*37. That's 37^3, which is way larger than 999. So even that is way too big. So even if the composite number has three prime factors, each greater than 31, the product would be way beyond three digits. 

But hold on, maybe the composite number is a power of a prime? For example, 37 squared is 1369, which is still four digits. So even if it's a square of a prime greater than 31, it's already too big. Therefore, there's no composite three-digit number that is a product of primes all greater than 31. 

Therefore, any composite three-digit number must have at least one prime factor less than or equal to 31. 

Wait, but let me check if there's a case where the number could be a product of a prime greater than 31 and another prime less than or equal to 31. But if that's the case, then the number would have a prime factor less than or equal to 31, which is exactly what we want. So, the problem is about numbers that don't have any prime factors ≤31. So if such a number exists, it must be a product of primes all greater than 31. But as we saw, the smallest such product is 37*37=1369 which is four digits. Therefore, there's no three-digit number that is a product of primes all greater than 31. Hence, any composite three-digit number must have at least one prime factor ≤31. 

But maybe I need to check if there are any composite three-digit numbers that are products of primes where one is greater than 31 and the other is less than or equal to 31. But that's not a problem because those numbers would already have a prime factor ≤31. Therefore, the only way a composite number can avoid having a prime factor ≤31 is if it's a product of primes all greater than 31, which is impossible for three-digit numbers. 

But let me check if there is a prime greater than 31 that when multiplied by another prime (possibly the same) gives a three-digit number. For example, 37*3=111. But 3 is less than 31. So that would have a prime factor 3. Similarly, 37*5=185, which is three digits. 5 is less than 31. So even if you multiply a prime greater than 31 by a smaller prime, the smaller prime is already ≤31. 

Alternatively, if you have a composite number that is a product of two primes both greater than 31, but as we saw, the smallest such product is 37*37=1369, which is four digits. Therefore, there is no three-digit number that is the product of two primes both greater than 31. Therefore, any composite three-digit number must have at least one prime factor ≤31. 

But wait, what about numbers with more than two prime factors? For example, 37*3* something? But again, if it's composite, it can be factored into primes, and if one of them is ≤31, then we are done. If all primes are greater than 31, then the product would be too big. 

Alternatively, maybe the number is a prime power? For example, 37^2 is 1369, which is too big. 37* something else. But again, if you have a prime power, the exponent would need to be such that the number is three digits. For example, 37^1 is 37, which is two digits. 37^2 is 1369. So no, there's no prime power of a prime greater than 31 that is three digits. 

Alternatively, maybe a number like 2*prime? But 2 is less than 31. So that would have a prime factor 2. 

Alternatively, maybe a number like 37* something where the something is not prime? But if the number is composite, then it can be factored into primes. So if it's not prime, then it's composite, so it can be broken down into primes. 

Wait, maybe I need to think about the prime factors of numbers between 100 and 999. The maximum possible prime factor of a three-digit number would be 999 itself, but if the number is composite, then it's not prime. However, if the number is composite, then it must have a prime factor less than or equal to its square root. Wait, that's a theorem. 

Ah! Yes, the square root of 999 is approximately 31.6. So, if a number is composite, then it must have a prime factor less than or equal to its square root. Therefore, for any composite number, if its square root is less than or equal to 31, then it must have a prime factor ≤31. However, if the square root is greater than 31, then maybe?

Wait, but the square root of 999 is about 31.6, so for numbers up to 999, the square root is up to about 31.6. Therefore, if a number is composite, it must have a prime factor less than or equal to its square root. Therefore, if the number is composite, then it must have a prime factor less than or equal to 31.6, so the prime factor is less than or equal to 31, since primes are integers. 

Wait, but that seems like a general theorem. Let me recall: for any composite number n, there exists a prime factor less than or equal to sqrt(n). Therefore, if n is a three-digit number, then sqrt(n) is at most sqrt(999) ≈ 31.6. Therefore, any composite three-digit number must have a prime factor ≤ 31. 

Therefore, that's the proof. 

But let me check if that's correct. Suppose n is composite, then it has a factor d such that 1 < d ≤ sqrt(n). If d is composite, then it can be factored further, so eventually, you get to a prime factor. Therefore, there must be a prime factor less than or equal to sqrt(n). Therefore, if n is composite, then it has a prime factor ≤ sqrt(n). Therefore, for n between 100 and 999, sqrt(n) is between 10 and 31.6. Therefore, the prime factor must be ≤ 31. 

Therefore, this shows that any composite three-digit number must have a prime factor ≤ 31. 

But let me check with an example. Let's take a three-digit number, say 121. 121 is 11 squared. 11 is less than 31. Another example: 169 is 13 squared. 13 is less than 31. How about 121, 169, 196, 225, etc. All of these have prime factors less than 31. 

What about a number like 37*37=1369, which is four digits. So that's not in our range. What about 37* something? Let's say 37*2=74, which is two digits. 37*3=111, which is three digits. 111 factors into 3*37. 3 is less than 31. So that's covered. 

Another example: 37*5=185. 5 is less than 31. 37*7=259. 7 is less than 31. 37*11=407. 11 is less than 31. 37*13=481. 13 is less than 31. 37*17=629. 17 is less than 31. 37*19=703. 19 is less than 31. 37*23=851. 23 is less than 31. 37*29=1073, which is four digits. So that's too big. 

So even when multiplying 37 by primes less than 31, you get three-digit numbers, which have prime factors less than 31. 

Another example: 31* something. 31 is a prime. 31*3=93, two digits. 31*4=124. 124 is three digits. 124 factors into 2*62, which is 2*2*31. So 2 and 31. 2 is less than 31. 

What about a number like 31*31=961. 961 is three digits. 31 is a prime factor. So that's exactly 31. So 31 is the prime factor. 

So, if you take a number that is a product of two primes, one of which is 31, then it's okay. But if you have a number that is a product of two primes both greater than 31, then it would be too big. 

But let me check if there's a three-digit number which is a product of two primes both greater than 31. The smallest such product is 37*37=1369, which is four digits. Therefore, there's no such three-digit number. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that any composite three-digit number must have a prime factor less than or equal to 31. 

Alternatively, if you have a three-digit number that is a cube of a prime. Let's say 37^3 is way too big. 3^3 is 27, too small. 5^3 is 125, which is three digits. 5 is less than 31. 7^3 is 343, which is three digits. 7 is less than 31. 11^3 is 1331, which is four digits. So, 11^3 is too big. Therefore, the cube of primes less than 31 would be three-digit numbers. 

So, for example, 5^3=125, which is composite, and 5 is less than 31. 

Therefore, in all cases, the prime factors are less than or equal to 31. 

Alternatively, if a composite number is a product of more than two primes. For example, 2*3* something. But again, 2 and 3 are less than 31. 

Alternatively, 2*2*2*... but again, primes involved are small. 

Therefore, seems like all possible composite three-digit numbers must have at least one prime factor less than or equal to 31. 

But let me check if there is a prime number greater than 31 that is a factor of a three-digit number. For example, 37 is a prime. 37*3=111, which is three digits. 111 is composite, and 3 is a prime factor. 37*5=185, which is composite, with 5 as a factor. 

But if you have a prime number like 37, and multiply it by another prime number, say 37*37=1369, which is too big. Therefore, 37 cannot be a factor of a three-digit number unless multiplied by a prime less than or equal to 31. 

Therefore, even if you have a prime factor greater than 31, like 37, the other factor has to be less than or equal to 31. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that any composite three-digit number must have a prime factor less than or equal to 31. 

Another way to think about it is that if there exists a composite three-digit number with all prime factors greater than 31, then that number would have to be at least the product of the two smallest primes greater than 31, which is 37*37=1369, which is a four-digit number. Therefore, there is no such three-digit number. Therefore, the original statement is proven. 

So, putting it all together, the key idea is that the smallest product of two primes greater than 31 is 37*37=1369, which is beyond three digits. Therefore, any composite three-digit number must have at least one prime factor less than or equal to 31. 

Therefore, the answer is that any composite three-digit number must have a prime factor ≤31, which is proven by considering the minimal product of primes greater than 31 and showing it exceeds three digits.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{31}
</think>

To prove that any composite three-digit number must have a prime factor less than or equal to 31, we begin by analyzing the nature of composite numbers and the range of three-digit numbers.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem

A **composite number** is a positive integer that is not prime — that is, it has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. A **three-digit number** is any integer between 100 and 999, inclusive.

We are to show that for **any composite** number in this range, **at least one of its prime factors must be ≤ 31**.

---

### Step 2: Key Theorem

A fundamental result in number theory is:

> **Every composite number has a prime factor less than or equal to its square root.**

This is because if a number $ n $ is composite, it must have a factor $ d $ such that $ 1 < d \leq \sqrt{n} $. If $ d $ is not prime, it can be factored further into primes, and at least one of those prime factors must be ≤ $ \sqrt{n} $.

---

### Step 3: Applying the Theorem to Three-Digit Numbers

The square root of 999 is approximately 31.6. Therefore, for any three-digit number $ n $, its square root is at most 31.6. Thus, **if $ n $ is composite**, it must have a prime factor $ \leq 31 $.

---

### Step 4: Contradiction Argument

Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a **composite three-digit number** that has **no prime factors ≤ 31**. Then all of its prime factors must be **greater than 31**.

The **smallest prime greater than 31 is 37**. The product of the two smallest such primes is:

$$
37 \times 37 = 1369
$$

This is a **four-digit number**, which is **greater than 999**. Therefore, there is **no composite three-digit number** that is the product of two primes both greater than 31.

Similarly, a composite number with **three or more prime factors** all greater than 31 would be even larger, and thus also not a three-digit number.

Hence, **no composite three-digit number can be composed entirely of prime factors greater than 31**.

---

### Step 5: Conclusion

Since **any composite number must have a prime factor ≤ its square root**, and the square root of 999 is about 31.6, **every composite three-digit number must have a prime factor ≤ 31**.
