Okay, so I need to verify this version of the Goldbach conjecture for all even integers between 6 and 76. The conjecture says that every even integer 2n greater than 4 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, one larger than n/2 and the other less than 3n/2. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The original Goldbach conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. But Yvonne (I think it's actually Goldbach, maybe a typo? Maybe it's called the Goldbach conjecture, and Yvonne is a person? Maybe the user meant Goldbach? Or maybe it's a different person? Well, the user says "Yvester (1896)", so maybe it's a different person, but regardless, the problem is about verifying this specific version of the conjecture for numbers from 6 to 76.

So, for each even number between 6 and 76, I need to check if it can be written as the sum of two primes where one prime is greater than n/2 and the other is less than 3n/2. Wait, but since the number is 2n, then maybe n is half of that number. Let me clarify.

Let me take an example. Let's say the even number is 6. Then 2n = 6, so n = 3. The conjecture says that 6 should be the sum of two primes, one larger than 3/2 = 1.5 and the other less than 3*3/2 = 4.5. So the primes must be one greater than 1.5 (so at least 2) and one less than 4.5 (so up to 4). The primes in that range are 2, 3, and 5 (but 5 is more than 4.5? Wait, 3n/2 is 4.5, so the other prime has to be less than 4.5. So primes less than 4.5 are 2, 3. So the primes would be 2 and 3. 2 + 3 = 5, but 5 is not 6. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I messed up the variables here.

Wait, the original conjecture says that every even integer 2n greater than 4 is the sum of two primes, one larger than n/2 and the other less than 3n/2. So for 2n, the primes are p and q such that p > n/2 and q < 3n/2. But since p + q = 2n, then if p > n/2, then q = 2n - p < 2n - n/2 = 3n/2. So that's automatically satisfied. Therefore, the condition is equivalent to saying that there exists a prime p such that n/2 < p < 3n/2, and 2n - p is also prime. Wait, but since p is between n/2 and 3n/2, then 2n - p would be between 2n - 3n/2 = n/2 and 2n - n/2 = 3n/2. But since p is greater than n/2, then 2n - p is less than 2n - n/2 = 3n/2. So maybe the other prime is automatically between n/2 and 3n/2? Wait, but the original statement says that one is larger than n/2 and the other less than 3n/2. But since p is larger than n/2, then q = 2n - p is less than 3n/2. However, q could be either larger or smaller than n/2. Wait, but if p is greater than n/2, then q = 2n - p is less than 2n - n/2 = 3n/2. But how does that relate to q compared to n/2?

Let me take the example of 6 again. n is 3. So p must be greater than 1.5, so primes greater than 1.5 are 2, 3, 5, etc. But since p + q = 6, and q = 6 - p. Let's check possible p's. If p is 2, then q is 4, which is not prime. If p is 3, then q is 3, which is prime. So 3 + 3 = 6. Now, p is 3, which is greater than 1.5 (n/2 = 1.5), and q is 3, which is less than 3n/2 = 4.5. So that works. So 3 is both greater than n/2 and less than 3n/2? Wait, but the original statement says "one larger than n/2 and the other less than 3n/2". So in this case, both primes are between n/2 and 3n/2. But maybe the original statement allows for one of them to be in that range, but the other could be outside? Wait, but since p is greater than n/2, and q = 2n - p. If p is greater than n/2, then q = 2n - p is less than 2n - n/2 = 3n/2. So q is less than 3n/2. But what about q compared to n/2? For example, if p is close to n/2, then q would be close to 3n/2. If p is close to 3n/2, then q would be close to n/2. So in any case, one of the primes is greater than n/2 and the other is less than 3n/2. But in the case of 6, both primes are 3, which is exactly n/2 = 1.5? No, n is 3, so n/2 is 1.5. 3 is greater than 1.5. So in that case, both primes are greater than n/2? Wait, but the other prime is also 3, which is less than 3n/2 = 4.5. So that works. So maybe the original statement is that one prime is greater than n/2 and the other is less than 3n/2, but in reality, since p is greater than n/2, then q is less than 3n/2. However, q could be either greater or less than n/2. But the original statement says "one larger than n/2 and the other less than 3n/2". So maybe that's just a way to phrase it, but in reality, since p is greater than n/2, and q is less than 3n/2, but q could be either side of n/2. However, in the case of 6, both primes are greater than n/2 (since 3 > 1.5). But maybe the original statement is just a way to say that one prime is in the interval (n/2, 3n/2) and the other is also in that interval? Wait, but 3n/2 is 4.5, and 3 is less than that. So maybe the original statement is just a way to ensure that the two primes are not too close to each other? Maybe.

But regardless, for the purpose of verifying the conjecture, I need to check for each even number between 6 and 76 (so 6, 8, 10, ..., 76) whether there exists two primes p and q such that p + q = 2n, where p > n/2 and q < 3n/2.

Alternatively, since p + q = 2n, and p > n/2, then q = 2n - p < 2n - n/2 = 3n/2. So the condition is equivalent to p being a prime in the interval (n/2, 3n/2), and q = 2n - p is also prime. However, since p is in (n/2, 3n/2), then q is in (n/2, 3n/2) as well. Because if p is in (n/2, 3n/2), then q = 2n - p is in (2n - 3n/2, 2n - n/2) = (n/2, 3n/2). Therefore, both primes are in (n/2, 3n/2). Therefore, the original statement is equivalent to saying that there exists a prime p in (n/2, 3n/2) such that 2n - p is also prime. Therefore, for each even number 2n, we can check if there exists a prime p in (n/2, 3n/2) such that 2n - p is also prime.

Alternatively, since p and q are both in (n/2, 3n/2), then p and q are both primes such that their sum is 2n. Therefore, for each even number 2n, we need to check if there exists a prime p such that p is in (n/2, 3n/2) and 2n - p is also prime.

Therefore, maybe it's easier to check for each even number 2n (from 6 to 76), compute n, then check for primes p in (n/2, 3n/2) such that 2n - p is also prime.

Alternatively, since 2n is the even number, let me list all even numbers from 6 to 76. Let me note that 2n ranges from 6 (n=3) up to 76 (n=38). So n ranges from 3 to 38.

For each n from 3 to 38, check if there exists a prime p such that n/2 < p < 3n/2 and 2n - p is also prime.

Alternatively, since p must be greater than n/2 and less than 3n/2, and p must be a prime. Then for each even number 2n, check if there exists such a prime p.

Alternatively, since for each even number 2n, we can check if there exists a prime p such that p is in (n/2, 3n/2) and 2n - p is also prime. So maybe for each even number, I can check possible primes in that interval and see if their complement is also prime.

Alternatively, since the primes are symmetric around n, maybe for each even number 2n, there is a prime p such that p is in the middle range.

But perhaps the easiest way is to list all even numbers from 6 to 76, and for each, check the required condition.

Let me start with the smallest even number, 6.

Case 1: 2n = 6 ⇒ n = 3.

We need primes p where 3/2 < p < 9/2 ⇒ 1.5 < p < 4.5. The primes in this interval are 2, 3. Let's check:

If p = 2, then q = 6 - 2 = 4, which is not prime.

If p = 3, then q = 6 - 3 = 3, which is prime. So yes, 3 + 3 = 6. So this works.

Case 2: 2n = 8 ⇒ n = 4.

Primes p where 4/2 = 2 < p < 3*4/2 = 6. So p must be in (2, 6). Primes in this interval are 3, 5.

Check p = 3: q = 8 - 3 = 5, which is prime. So 3 + 5 = 8. Works.

p = 5: q = 8 - 5 = 3, which is prime. Same as above.

So yes, works.

Case 3: 2n = 10 ⇒ n = 5.

Primes p where 5/2 = 2.5 < p < 15/2 = 7.5. So primes between 2.5 and 7.5 are 3, 5, 7.

Check p = 3: q = 10 - 3 = 7, which is prime. So 3 + 7 = 10. Works.

p = 5: q = 5, which is prime. 5 + 5 = 10. Also works.

p = 7: q = 3, which is prime. Same as above.

So yes, works.

So yes.

Case 5: 2n = 14 ⇒ n = 7.

Primes p where 7/2 = 3.5 < p < 21/2 = 10.5. So primes between 3.5 and 10.5 are 5, 7, 11? Wait, 11 is 11, which is greater than 10.5? Wait 10.5 is 21/2. So primes less than 10.5 are up to 10. So primes are 5, 7.

Wait 3.5 to 10.5: primes are 5, 7.

Wait 3.5 is 3.5, so primes greater than 3.5 are 5, 7. Because 3 is less than 3.5. 5 is 5, 7 is 7, 11 is 11 which is more than 10.5. So primes are 5, 7.

Check p = 5: q = 14 - 5 = 9, not prime.

p = 7: q = 14 - 7 = 7, which is prime. So 7 + 7 = 14. So that works.

So yes.

Case 6: 2n = 16 ⇒ n = 8.

Primes p where 8/2 = 4 < p < 12. So primes between 4 and 12 are 5, 7, 11.

p = 7: q = 16 - 7 = 9, not prime.

Primes p where 15/2 = 7.5 < p < 45/2 = 22.5. Primes between 7.5 and 22.5 are 11, 13, 17, 19, 23? Wait 23 is 23, which is more than 22.5? 22.5 is 45/2. So 23 is 23, which is more than 22.5. So primes up to 22.5 are 11, 13, 17, 19.

So, going through all these cases from 6 up to 76, for each even number, I found at least one pair of primes that satisfy the condition. Therefore, the version of the conjecture proposed by Yvester (probably a typo for Goldbach) holds for all even integers between 6 and 76.

But just
