Okay, so I need to prove that if p is a prime number and p² + 8 is also a prime number, then p³ + 4 must be prime as well. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, let me recall that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, p has to be a prime, and when you square it and add 8, the result is also prime. Then, based on that, I need to show that p cubed plus 4 is prime.

Let me think about possible values of p. Since p is a prime, the smallest primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. Maybe I can check these small primes first to see if they satisfy the condition that p² + 8 is also prime. Then, check if p³ + 4 is prime for those cases. If that's true for all such primes, maybe I can generalize.

Let me start with p = 2. Then p² + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12. But 12 is not a prime number because it's divisible by 2, 3, etc. So p = 2 doesn't satisfy the condition. Therefore, p cannot be 2.

Next, p = 3. Then p² + 8 = 9 + 8 = 17. 17 is a prime number. So p = 3 is a candidate. Then, p³ + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31. 31 is also a prime number. So that works.

Next prime is 5. Let's check p = 5. p² + 8 = 25 + 8 = 33. 33 is not prime because it's divisible by 3 and 11. So p = 5 doesn't work.

Next prime is 7. p² + 8 = 49 + 8 = 57. 57 is divisible by 3 (since 5 + 7 = 12, which is divisible by 3), so 57 = 3 * 19. Not prime. So p = 7 doesn't work.

Next prime is 11. p² + 8 = 121 + 8 = 129. 129 is divisible by 3 (1 + 2 + 9 = 12, which is divisible by 3), so 129 = 3 * 43. Not prime.

Next prime is 13. p² + 8 = 169 + 8 = 177. Again, 1 + 7 + 7 = 15, divisible by 3, so 177 is divisible by 3. Not prime.

Hmm, so far, only p = 3 works. Let me check p = 17? Wait, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think.

Wait, maybe there are only a few primes where p² + 8 is prime. Let me check p = 3 again. p = 3, p² + 8 = 17, which is prime. What about p = 1? Wait, 1 is not a prime. So p has to be 2 or higher.

Wait, let me check p = 3 again. Then p³ + 4 is 31, which is prime. So maybe p = 3 is the only prime that satisfies the condition. If that's the case, then the conclusion is that p³ + 4 is prime. But how do I prove that?

But the problem says "prove that p³ + 4 is also prime" given that p and p² + 8 are primes. So maybe there's only one such prime p, which is 3, and hence p³ + 4 is 31, which is prime. Therefore, the conclusion follows.

But perhaps there are other primes p where p² + 8 is prime? Let me check p = 7 again. Wait, p = 7, p² + 8 = 57, which is not prime. How about p = 5? 25 + 8 = 33, not prime. p = 2: 12, not prime. p = 3: 17, prime. p = 11: 129, not prime. p = 13: 177, not prime. p = 17: 289 + 8 = 297. 297 divided by 3 is 99, so 3*99, not prime. p = 19: 361 + 8 = 369. 3 + 6 + 9 = 18, divisible by 3, so 369 is divisible by 3. Not prime.

p = 23: 529 + 8 = 537. 5 + 3 + 7 = 15, divisible by 3. Not prime. p = 29: 841 + 8 = 849. 8 + 4 + 9 = 21, divisible by 3. Not prime. So seems like after p = 3, p² + 8 is divisible by 3? Let me check.

Wait, let me think algebraically. Let me consider p as a prime. If p is not 3, then p can be congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3. Because primes other than 3 are not divisible by 3.

So, if p ≡ 1 mod 3, then p² ≡ 1² = 1 mod 3. Then p² + 8 ≡ 1 + 8 = 9 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, p² + 8 is divisible by 3. Since p² + 8 is a prime, it must be equal to 3. Therefore, p² + 8 = 3. Then p² = -5, which is impossible. Therefore, if p ≡ 1 mod 3, then p² + 8 is divisible by 3 and greater than 3, hence not prime. Therefore, p cannot be congruent to 1 mod 3.

Similarly, if p ≡ 2 mod 3, then p² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, p² + 8 ≡ 1 + 8 = 9 ≡ 0 mod 3. Again, same conclusion. Therefore, p² + 8 is divisible by 3. Therefore, unless p² + 8 = 3, which would require p² = -5, which is impossible, p² + 8 cannot be prime if p is not 3.

Therefore, the only possible prime p is 3. Because if p is 3, then p ≡ 0 mod 3, so p² + 8 = 9 + 8 = 17, which is prime. Therefore, the only prime p that satisfies the condition is 3. Therefore, p³ + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31, which is prime. Therefore, the conclusion is that p³ + 4 is prime.

Wait, but let me check if there's another prime p where p² + 8 is prime. For example, p = 3 is the only one? Because if p is 3, then p² + 8 is 17. If p is 2, then p² + 8 is 12, not prime. If p is 5, 25 + 8 = 33, not prime. So seems like p = 3 is the only prime for which p² + 8 is prime. Therefore, the only possible p is 3, and then p³ + 4 is 31, which is prime. Therefore, the statement is proven.

But let me check if there's a case where p² + 8 is prime when p is 3. So p = 3 is the only one. Therefore, since the problem says "if p and p² + 8 are both prime", then p must be 3. Therefore, p³ + 4 must be 31, which is prime. Therefore, the conclusion follows.

Alternatively, maybe there's a case when p² + 8 is 3? Let me check. p² + 8 = 3 => p² = -5. Not possible. So no. Therefore, p must be 3. Therefore, the only possible p is 3, and hence p³ + 4 is prime. Therefore, the statement is proven.

But maybe I need to formalize this more. Let me try.

First, suppose that p is a prime number such that p² + 8 is also prime. We need to show that p³ + 4 is prime.

First, note that p must be odd, except for p = 2. Let me check p = 2. If p = 2, then p² + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12, which is not prime. Therefore, p cannot be 2.

Therefore, p must be an odd prime. Therefore, p is odd. Therefore, p is at least 3.

Now, consider p as an odd prime. Then p is either 1 or 2 mod 3. But as we saw earlier, if p is not 3, then p² ≡ 1 mod 3, so p² + 8 ≡ 1 + 8 = 9 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, p² + 8 is divisible by 3. Since p² + 8 is prime, it must be equal to 3. Therefore, p² + 8 = 3 => p² = -5, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is that p = 3. Because if p is 3, then p² + 8 = 9 + 8 = 17, which is prime. Therefore, p must be 3.

Therefore, the only prime p for which p and p² + 8 are both prime is p = 3. Therefore, p³ + 4 = 3³ + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31, which is prime. Therefore, the statement is proven.

Therefore, the conclusion is that p³ + 4 is prime.

Alternatively, maybe there is another way to think about this. Let me check if there are other primes where p² + 8 is prime. For example, let me check p = 7. p² + 8 = 49 + 8 = 57, which is 3*19. Not prime. p = 5: 25 + 8 = 33, 3*11. Not prime. p = 11: 121 + 8 = 129, 3*43. Not prime. p = 13: 169 + 8 = 177, 3*59. Not prime. p = 17: 289 + 8 = 297, 3*99. Not prime. So indeed, only p = 3 works. Therefore, p must be 3. Therefore, p³ + 4 is 31, which is prime.

Therefore, the answer is that p³ + 4 is prime, as 31 is prime.

But maybe I need to write this as a proof. Let me try to structure it properly.

Proof:

Assume that p is a prime number such that p² + 8 is also prime. We need to show that p³ + 4 is prime.

First, note that if p = 2, then p² + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12, which is not prime. Therefore, p cannot be 2.

Therefore, p must be an odd prime. Let us consider p modulo 3.

Case 1: p = 3. Then p² + 8 = 9 + 8 = 17, which is prime. Then p³ + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31, which is prime. Therefore, the statement holds.

Case 2: p ≠ 3. Then p is not divisible by 3, so p ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3.

If p ≡ 1 mod 3, then p² ≡ 1² ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, p² + 8 ≡ 1 + 8 ≡ 9 ≡ 0 mod 3. Hence, p² + 8 is divisible by 3. Since p² + 8 is prime, it must be equal to 3. Therefore, p² + 8 = 3 ⇒ p² = -5, which is impossible.

Similarly, if p ≡ 2 mod 3, then p² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, p² + 8 ≡ 1 + 8 ≡ 9 ≡ 0 mod 3. Again, p² + 8 is divisible by 3. Therefore, p² + 8 = 3 ⇒ p² = -5, impossible.

Therefore, the only possible prime p is 3. Therefore, p³ + 4 = 31, which is prime. Hence, the statement is proven.

Therefore, the conclusion is that p³ + 4 is prime.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{31}
</think>

To prove that if $ p $ and $ p^2 + 8 $ are both prime numbers, then $ p^3 + 4 $ is also prime, we proceed with a structured analysis based on the properties of prime numbers and modular arithmetic.

### Step 1: Analyze the Case for Small Primes

We begin by testing small prime values for $ p $:

- $ p = 2 $: $ p^2 + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12 $, not prime.
- $ p = 3 $: $ p^2 + 8 = 9 + 8 = 17 $, which is prime.
- $ p = 5 $: $ p^2 + 8 = 25 + 8 = 33 $, not prime.
- $ p = 7 $: $ p^2 + 8 = 49 + 8 = 57 $, not prime.
- $ p = 11 $: $ p^2 + 8 = 121 + 8 = 129 $, not prime.

So far, only $ p = 3 $ satisfies the condition that both $ p $ and $ p^2 + 8 $ are prime.

---

### Step 2: General Argument Using Modular Arithmetic

Let us now consider the general case where $ p $ is a prime number, and $ p^2 + 8 $ is also prime.

We note that:

- If $ p = 2 $, then $ p^2 + 8 = 12 $, not prime.
- If $ p \neq 2 $, then $ p $ is an odd prime, so $ p $ is either $ 1 $ or $ 2 \mod 3 $.

Let’s examine both cases:

- **If $ p \equiv 1 \mod 3 $**:  
  Then $ p^2 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $, so $ p^2 + 8 \equiv 1 + 8 = 9 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $, meaning $ p^2 + 8 $ is divisible by 3.  
  Since $ p^2 + 8 $ is prime, it must be equal to 3. But this would imply $ p^2 = -5 $, which is not possible.

- **If $ p \equiv 2 \mod 3 $**:  
  Then $ p^2 \equiv 4 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $, so again $ p^2 + 8 \equiv 1 + 8 = 9 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $, which again implies $ p^2 + 8 $ is divisible by 3.  
  Again, this would require $ p^2 = -5 $, which is not possible.

Thus, the only possible value of $ p $ for which both $ p $ and $ p^2 + 8 $ are prime is $ p = 3 $.

---

### Step 3: Evaluate $ p^3 + 4 $ for $ p = 3 $

If $ p = 3 $, then:

$$
p^3 + 4 = 3^3 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31
$$

31 is a prime number.

---

### Conclusion

The only prime number $ p $ such that both $ p $ and $ p^2 + 8 $ are prime is $ p = 3 $. For this value, $ p^3 + 4 = 31 $, which is also prime.

Hence, the statement is proven.
