Okay, so I need to verify these four assertions about repunits. Let me start by recalling what a repunit is. A repunit is a number consisting of all 1s in base 10. So, R₁ is 1, R₂ is 11, R₃ is 111, and so on. The general formula for Rₙ is (10ⁿ - 1)/9. That's because 11...1 with n digits is equal to (10ⁿ - 1)/9. For example, 111 = (10³ - 1)/9 = 999/9 = 111. Got that.

Now, moving on to part (a): If n divides m, then Rₙ divides Rₘ. Let me try to understand this. So, if n is a divisor of m, then the repunit with n digits divides the repunit with m digits. Let me try with some examples. Let's take n=1 and m=2. Then R₁=1, R₂=11. 1 divides 11, which is true. Another example: n=2, m=4. R₂=11, R₄=1111. Does 11 divide 1111? Let's check: 1111 divided by 11 is 101, which is an integer. So yes. Another example: n=3, m=6. R₃=111, R₆=111111. Dividing 111111 by 111: 111111 / 111 = 1001, which is an integer. So that works. So maybe the general formula is that Rₙ divides Rₘ when n divides m. But how to prove this?

Let me think algebraically. Since Rₘ = (10^m - 1)/9, and Rₙ = (10^n - 1)/9. If n divides m, then m = n*k for some integer k. Let me substitute m = n*k into Rₘ. Then Rₘ = (10^{n*k} - 1)/9. Now, I need to show that Rₙ divides this. So, does (10^n - 1)/9 divide (10^{n*k} - 1)/9? Well, since both denominators are 9, we can focus on the numerators. So, does 10^n - 1 divide 10^{n*k} - 1? Let me recall that 10^{n*k} - 1 can be factored as (10^n)^k - 1. Which is a difference of powers. The formula for a^k - 1 is (a - 1)(a^{k-1} + a^{k-2} + ... + 1). Therefore, 10^{n*k} - 1 = (10^n - 1)(10^{n(k-1)} + 10^{n(k-2)} + ... + 10^n + 1). Therefore, 10^n - 1 divides 10^{n*k} - 1. Therefore, (10^n - 1)/9 divides (10^{n*k} - 1)/9, which is Rₘ. Therefore, Rₙ divides Rₘ. So that proves part (a). Okay, that seems solid.

Moving on to part (b): If d divides Rₙ and d divides Rₘ, then d divides R_{n+m}. Hmm. So, if a number d divides both Rₙ and Rₘ, then it must divide R_{n+m}. Let me think. Again, using the formula Rₙ = (10ⁿ - 1)/9. So, if d divides Rₙ and Rₘ, then d divides (10ⁿ - 1)/9 and (10ᵐ - 1)/9. Therefore, 10ⁿ ≡ 1 mod d and 10ᵐ ≡ 1 mod d. So, 10^{n} ≡ 1 mod d and 10^{m} ≡ 1 mod d. Then, we need to show that 10^{n+m} ≡ 1 mod d. Well, 10^{n+m} = 10^n * 10^m ≡ 1 * 1 = 1 mod d. Therefore, 10^{n+m} ≡ 1 mod d, so (10^{n+m} - 1)/9 ≡ 0 mod d. Therefore, d divides R_{n+m}. Therefore, that's the proof. Wait, but is there a catch here? Let me check with an example. Suppose d divides R₂ and R₄. Let's take d=11. R₂=11, R₄=1111. 11 divides both. Then R_{2+4}=R₆=111111. 11 divides 111111? Yes, because 111111 / 11 = 10101. So that works. Another example: Let me take d=3. R₁=1, R₂=11. 3 divides R₁? No, 1 mod 3 is 1. Wait, but 3 divides R₃=111. So if I take n=3 and m=3, then d=3 divides R₃ and R₃, so d divides R_{6}=111111. 111111 divided by 3 is 37037, which is integer. So that works. Wait, but in this case, d=3 divides R₃ and R₃, so d divides R_{3+3}=R₆. So that seems to hold. Another example: take d=7. R₆=111111. 111111 divided by 7 is 15873. So 7 divides R₆. Also, R₇=1111111. 1111111 divided by 7 is 158730.142... Wait, no. Wait 7*158730 = 1,111,110. Then 1,111,111 - 1,111,110 = 1. Therefore, 7 does not divide R₇. But let's check if there is a d that divides Rₙ and Rₘ. Let me take n=3 and m=6. R₃=111, R₆=111111. Let me check if 3 divides both. Yes, 111 is divisible by 3, 111111 is divisible by 3. Then, according to part (b), d=3 divides R_{3+6}=R₉. Let's check R₉=111111111. Divided by 3: sum of digits is 9, which is divisible by 3. So yes, 3 divides R₉. So that works. So seems like the logic holds. Therefore, the proof is as follows: if d divides Rₙ and Rₘ, then 10ⁿ ≡ 1 mod d and 10ᵐ ≡ 1 mod d, so multiplying them gives 10^{n+m} ≡ 1 mod d, so d divides R_{n+m}. Therefore, part (b) is proven.

Now part (c): If gcd(n, m) = 1, then gcd(Rₙ, Rₘ) = 1. So, if n and m are coprime, then their repunits are coprime. Let me think. Let me try with examples. Take n=2, m=3. gcd(2,3)=1. R₂=11, R₃=111. gcd(11,111). 11 divides 111? 11*10=110, 111-110=1, so no. So gcd is 1. Another example: n=1, m=2. gcd(1,2)=1. R₁=1, R₂=11. gcd(1,11)=1. Another example: n=3, m=4. R₃=111, R₄=1111. Let me compute gcd(111,1111). 111 divides 1111? 111*10=1110, 1111-1110=1. So no. Therefore, gcd is 1. So seems like it works. How to prove it?

Well, suppose that d is a common divisor of Rₙ and Rₘ. Then, by part (b), d divides R_{n + m}. But since gcd(n, m) = 1, then n and m are coprime. Wait, but how does that help? Alternatively, maybe using the fact that if d divides Rₙ and Rₘ, then d divides R_{n + m} and also divides R_{n - m} if n > m. But maybe another approach. Let me think.

Alternatively, since Rₙ = (10ⁿ - 1)/9 and Rₘ = (10ᵐ - 1)/9. Suppose that d divides both Rₙ and Rₘ. Then, as before, 10ⁿ ≡ 1 mod d and 10ᵐ ≡ 1 mod d. Therefore, the order of 10 modulo d divides both n and m. Since gcd(n, m) = 1, the order must divide 1, so the order is 1. Therefore, 10^1 ≡ 1 mod d, so 10 ≡ 1 mod d, which implies that d divides 9. Therefore, the possible common divisors d are divisors of 9. But R₁ = 1, which is coprime with everything. Wait, but if d divides Rₙ and Rₘ, then d divides 9? Wait, but for example, take n=2 and m=3. Then, d divides R₂=11 and R₃=111. The gcd(11,111)=1. So in this case, d=1. But according to the above, d divides 9. So 1 divides 9. So that works. But if there is a common divisor d>1, then d divides 9. But 9's divisors are 1, 3, 9. Let's check if 3 divides R₂=11? 11 mod 3 is 2, so no. 3 divides R₃=111? Yes, because 1+1+1=3. But since 3 divides R₃ but not R₂, then gcd(R₂, R₃)=1. Similarly, 9 divides R₃? 111 divided by 9 is 12.333... so no. So 9 doesn't divide R₃. Therefore, the only common divisor is 1. Therefore, gcd(Rₙ, Rₘ)=1. Therefore, the conclusion is that if n and m are coprime, then their repunits are coprime.

Wait, but let me check if there is a case where d divides both Rₙ and Rₘ with d>1. Suppose n and m are coprime. Let me take n=1 and m=2. Then, R₁=1 and R₂=11. gcd(1,11)=1. If n=1 and m=3, same thing. If n=2 and m=3, gcd(R₂, R₃)=1. What about n=4 and m=6? Wait, but gcd(4,6)=2, so they are not coprime. But if n=4 and m=5, which are coprime. R₄=1111, R₅=11111. Let's compute gcd(1111, 11111). Let me divide 11111 by 1111. 1111*10=11110, so 11111-11110=1. Therefore, gcd is 1. So that works. Therefore, seems like the only common divisor is 1. Therefore, the logic is that if d divides both Rₙ and Rₘ, then d divides 9, but since 9 does not divide Rₙ or Rₘ unless n is a multiple of something. Wait, but how does that follow?

Earlier, I said that if d divides Rₙ and Rₘ, then the order of 10 modulo d divides both n and m. Since gcd(n, m) = 1, the order must be 1. Therefore, 10^1 ≡ 1 mod d, so 10 ≡ 1 mod d, so d divides 9. Therefore, the only possible common divisors are divisors of 9. However, for example, 3 divides R₃=111, but does it divide R₂=11? 11 divided by 3 is 3.666... so no. Therefore, the only common divisor is 1. Therefore, gcd(Rₙ, Rₘ)=1. Therefore, that's the proof. Therefore, part (c) is proven.

Now part (d): Use the previous problem to obtain the prime factors of the repunit R₁₀. So, R₁₀ is 1111111111. We need to find its prime factors. The previous problem is part (c), which says that if gcd(n, m)=1, then gcd(Rₙ, Rₘ)=1. So, maybe we can use that to factor R₁₀. Let me think.

First, note that R₁₀ = (10¹⁰ - 1)/9. Let me factor 10¹⁰ - 1. 10¹⁰ - 1 can be factored as (10⁵ - 1)(10⁵ + 1). Then, 10⁵ - 1 is (10 - 1)(10⁴ + 10³ + 10² + 10 + 1) = 9 * R₅. Similarly, 10⁵ + 1 = (10 + 1)(10⁴ - 10³ + 10² - 10 + 1) = 11 * R₅', where R₅' is some number. Wait, but maybe I need to factor 10¹⁰ - 1 further. Let me write down the factorization.

10¹⁰ - 1 = (10⁵ - 1)(10⁵ + 1) = (10 - 1)(10⁴ + 10³ + 10² + 10 + 1)(10⁵ + 1). Then, 10⁵ + 1 can be factored further. Since 10⁵ + 1 = (10 + 1)(10⁴ - 10³ + 10² - 10 + 1) = 11 * (10⁴ - 10³ + 10² - 10 + 1). Therefore, 10¹⁰ - 1 = 9 * R₅ * 11 * (10⁴ - 10³ + 10² - 10 + 1). Therefore, R₁₀ = (10¹⁰ - 1)/9 = R₅ * 11 * (10⁴ - 10³ + 10² - 10 + 1). So, R₁₀ factors into R₅ * 11 * something. Now, R₅ is 11111, which is 41 * 271, I think. Wait, but maybe I need to check. Alternatively, maybe I can use part (c) to find the factors. Let me think.

Alternatively, since R₁₀ = R_{2*5}, and since 2 and 5 are coprime. Wait, but part (a) says that if n divides m, then R_n divides R_m. But here, 2 and 5 are coprime. Maybe I need to use part (b) or (c). Wait, but how does that help me factor R₁₀?

Alternatively, since R₁₀ = (10¹⁰ - 1)/9. Let me factor 10¹⁰ - 1. As above, 10¹⁰ - 1 = (10^5 - 1)(10^5 + 1) = (10 - 1)(10^4 + 10^3 + 10^2 + 10 + 1)(10^5 + 1). Which is 9 * R_5 * 11 * (something). Therefore, R_10 = R_5 * 11 * (something). So, if I can factor R_5 and the something, then I can get the factors of R_10. But R_5 is 11111. Let me check what factors 11111 has. Let me try dividing 11111 by small primes. 11111 divided by 11 is 1010.09... Wait, 11*1010 = 11110, so 11111 - 11110 = 1. Therefore, not divisible by 11. How about 41? Let me check 41*271. 41*271: 40*271 + 1*271 = 10840 + 271 = 11111. Yes! So 41*271 = 11111. Therefore, R_5 = 41*271. Then, the other factor is 10⁴ - 10³ + 10² - 10 + 1. Let me compute that. 10⁴ is 10000, 10³ is 1000, 10² is 100, 10 is 10. So, 10000 - 1000 + 100 - 10 + 1 = 10000 - 1000 is 9000, +100 is 9100, -10 is 9090, +1 is 9091. Therefore, 9091. So R₁₀ = R₅ * 11 * 9091. Therefore, R₁₀ is 41 * 271 * 11 * 9091. Now, need to check if these are primes. 11 is prime. 41 is prime. 271 is prime? Let me check. 271 divided by 2, no. 3? 2+7+1=10, not divisible by 3. 5? No. 7? 7*38=266, 271-266=5, not divisible by 7. 11? 11*24=264, 271-264=7, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*20=260, 271-260=11, not divisible by 13. 17? 17*15=255, 271-255=16, not divisible by 17. So 271 is prime. 9091: Let me check if it's prime. Let me check divisibility. 9091. Let me check if it's divisible by small primes. 2? No. 3? 9+0+9+1=19, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 1, no. 7? Let me do 9091 divided by 7. 7*1298= 9086, 9091-9086=5, not divisible by 7. 11? 9 - 0 + 9 - 1 = 17, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*699 = 9087, 9091 - 9087 = 4, not divisible by 13. 17? 17*534 = 9078, 9091 - 9078 = 13, not divisible by 17. 19? 19*478 = 9082, 9091 - 9082 = 9, not divisible by 19. 23? 23*395 = 9085, 9091 - 9085 = 6, not divisible by 23. 29? 29*313 = 9077, 9091 - 9077 = 14, not divisible by 29. 31? 31*293 = 9083, 9091 - 9083 = 8, not divisible by 31. 37? Let me check 37*245 = 9065, 9091 - 9065 = 26, not divisible by 37. 41? 41*221 = 9061, 9091 - 9061 = 30, not divisible by 41. 43? 43*211 = 9073, 9091 - 9073 = 18, not divisible by 43. 47? 47*193 = 9071, 9091 - 9071 = 20, not divisible by 47. 53? 53*171 = 9063, 9091 - 9063 = 28, not divisible by 53. 59? 59*154 = 9086, 9091 - 9086 = 5, not divisible by 59. 61? 61*149 = 9089, 9091 - 9089 = 2, not divisible by 61. So up to sqrt(9091) which is approx 95.3. So need to check primes up to 95. Let me check 71? 71*128 = 9088, 9091 - 9088 = 3, not divisible. 73? 73*124 = 9052, 9091 - 9052 = 39, not divisible. 79? 79*115 = 9085, 9091 - 9085 = 6, not divisible. 83? 83*109 = 9047, 9091 - 9047 = 44, not divisible. 89? 89*102 = 9078, 9091 - 9078 = 13, not divisible. 97? 97*93 = 9021, 9091 - 9021 = 70, not divisible by 97. Therefore, 9091 is a prime. Therefore, R₁₀ factors into 11 * 41 * 271 * 9091. Therefore, the prime factors are 11, 41, 271, 9091.

But wait, let me check if there is a way to use part (c) to get this. Since R₁₀ = R_{2*5}. But since 2 and 5 are coprime, maybe we can use part (c). But how? Wait, part (c) says that if n and m are coprime, then gcd(R_n, R_m) = 1. But how does that help in factoring R₁₀? Maybe not directly. Alternatively, since R₁₀ = R_{10} = (10^{10} - 1)/9. We can factor 10^{10} - 1 as (10^5 - 1)(10^5 + 1). Then, 10^5 - 1 = (10 - 1)(10^4 + 10^3 + 10^2 + 10 + 1) = 9 * R_5. Then, 10^5 + 1 = 10^5 + 1 = (10 + 1)(10^4 - 10^3 + 10^2 - 10 + 1) = 11 * 9091. Therefore, R₁₀ = (9 * R_5 * 11 * 9091)/9 = R_5 * 11 * 9091. Then, R_5 is 11111 = 41 * 271. Therefore, R₁₀ = 11 * 41 * 271 * 9091. Therefore, the prime factors are 11, 41, 271, 9091. Therefore, that's the answer.

But let me check if there is a way to use part (b) or (c) in this process. For example, if we know that R₁₀ is divisible by R_5 and R_2? Wait, since 5 divides 10, so by part (a), R_5 divides R_{10}. Also, since 2 divides 10, R_2 divides R_{10}. But R_2 is 11, which is a prime. So, R_10 is divisible by 11. Also, R_5 is 11111, which is 41*271. Therefore, that's how we get the factors. Therefore, using part (a) to factor R_{10} into R_5 * 11 * 9091, then factor R_5 further. So, maybe that's the way.

Alternatively, since 10 = 2 * 5, and since 2 and 5 are coprime, then maybe R_{10} can be written as R_{2*5} and using some properties? Not sure. But the way I did before is more straightforward.

Therefore, the prime factors of R₁₀ are 11, 41, 271, and 9091.

Let me check with an online source or calculation. Wait, I can check if 11*41*271*9091 equals R₁₀. Let me compute 11*41 = 451. 451*271. Let me compute 451*271. 451*200 = 90,200. 451*70 = 31,570. 451*1 = 451. Total is 90,200 + 31,570 = 121,770 + 451 = 122,221. Then multiply by 9091. Wait, that seems too big. Wait, but R₁₀ is 1111111111. Let me check 11*41*271*9091. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 11*41*271*9091 step by step. But maybe that's too tedious. Alternatively, since we know that 11*41*271*9091 = 11* (41*271) * 9091 = 11*11111*9091. Then 11*11111 is 122221, then 122221 * 9091. But that would be a huge number. However, since we already know that R₁₀ is (10¹⁰ - 1)/9 = 1111111111. Let me check 11*41*271*9091. Alternatively, since we know that R₁₀ = R_5 * 11 * 9091, and R_5 is 11111, which is 41*271, then R₁₀ = 11*41*271*9091. Therefore, that must be the prime factors. Therefore, the answer is 11, 41, 271, 9091.

Therefore, part (d) is done.

**Final Answer**

(d) The prime factors of $ R_{10} $ are $\boxed{11}$, $\boxed{41}$, $\boxed{271}$, and $\boxed{9091}$.
</think>

To verify the assertions about repunits $ R_n $, we begin with the definition:

$$
R_n = \frac{10^n - 1}{9}
$$

---

### **(a) If $ n \mid m $, then $ R_n \mid R_m $**

Given $ m = nk $, we write:

$$
R_m = \frac{10^{nk} - 1}{9}
$$

We observe that:

$$
10^{nk} - 1 = (10^n)^k - 1 = (10^n - 1)(10^{n(k-1)} + 10^{n(k-2)} + \cdots + 1)
$$

Thus:

$$
R_m = \frac{(10^n - 1)(\text{some integer})}{9} = R_n \cdot \text{integer}
$$

Therefore, $ R_n \mid R_m $.

---

### **(b) If $ d \mid R_n $ and $ d \mid R_m $, then $ d \mid R_{n+m} $**

If $ d \mid R_n $ and $ d \mid R_m $, then:

$$
10^n \equiv 1 \pmod{d}, \quad 10^m \equiv 1 \pmod{d}
$$

Then:

$$
10^{n+m} = 10^n \cdot 10^m \equiv 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \pmod{d}
\Rightarrow 10^{n+m} \equiv 1 \pmod{d}
\Rightarrow R_{n+m} = \frac{10^{n+m} - 1}{9} \equiv 0 \pmod{d}
$$

Hence, $ d \mid R_{n+m} $.

---

### **(c) If $ \gcd(n, m) = 1 $, then $ \gcd(R_n, R_m) = 1 $**

Suppose $ \gcd(n, m) = 1 $, and $ d \mid R_n, R_m $. Then:

$$
10^n \equiv 1 \pmod{d}, \quad 10^m \equiv 1 \pmod{d}
\Rightarrow \text{the order of 10 modulo } d \mid n, m
\Rightarrow \text{order of 10 modulo } d \mid \gcd(n, m) = 1
\Rightarrow \text{order of 10 modulo } d = 1
\Rightarrow 10 \equiv 1 \pmod{d} \Rightarrow d \mid 9
$$

Thus, possible values of $ d $ are 1, 3, or 9. But none of these divide both $ R_n $ and $ R_m $ unless $ n $ or $ m $ is 1. Therefore, the only common divisor is 1, so:

$$
\gcd(R_n, R_m) = 1
$$

---

### **(d) Prime factors of $ R_{10} $**

We compute:

$$
R_{10} = \frac{10^{10} - 1}{9}
$$

Factor $ 10^{10} - 1 $ as:

$$
10^{10} - 1 = (10^5 - 1)(10^5 + 1)
$$

Then:

$$
10^5 - 1 = (10 - 1)(10^4 + 10^3 + 10^2 + 10 + 1) = 9 \cdot R_5
$$
$$
10^5 + 1 = (10 + 1)(10^4 - 10^3 + 10^2 - 10 + 1) = 11 \cdot 9091
$$

So:

$$
R_{10} = \frac{(9 \cdot R_5)(11 \cdot 9091)}{9} = R_5 \cdot 11 \cdot 9091
$$

Now, factor $ R_5 = 11111 $:

$$
11111 = 41 \cdot 271
$$

Thus:

$$
R_{10} = 11 \cdot 41 \cdot 271 \cdot 9091
$$

All these factors are prime:

- $ 11 $ is prime
- $ 41 $ is prime
- $ 271 $ is prime
- $ 9091 $ is prime (confirmed via primality test)

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{11}, \boxed{41}, \boxed{271}, \boxed{9091}
$$
