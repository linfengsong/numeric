Okay, so I need to show that every square-full number can be written in the form $ n = a^2b^3 $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are positive integers. Let me start by recalling what a square-full number is. The problem says that a positive integer $ n $ is square-full if for every prime factor $ p $ of $ n $, $ p^2 $ divides $ n $. So, for example, if a prime $ p $ divides $ n $, then $ p^2 $ must also divide $ n $. 

First, let me think about the prime factorization of $ n $. Suppose $ n $ has the prime factorization $ n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \dots p_k^{e_k} $, where each $ e_i $ is a positive integer. Since $ n $ is square-full, for each prime $ p_i $, $ p_i^2 $ divides $ n $, which means that $ e_i \geq 2 $. So, each exponent in the prime factorization is at least 2. 

But the problem wants me to show that such a number can be written as $ a^2b^3 $. Let me think about how to express $ n $ in that form. If I can write $ n $ as a square times a cube, then that would satisfy the condition. Let me try to decompose the exponents in the prime factorization into parts that can be expressed as squares and cubes.

Let me take each exponent $ e_i $ in the prime factorization of $ n $. Since each $ e_i \geq 2 $, maybe I can write each $ e_i $ as $ 2m_i + 3n_i $, but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, since we want $ n = a^2b^3 $, then each prime factor in $ n $ will be present in both $ a^2 $ and $ b^3 $. Let me think about how exponents work in such a product.

Suppose $ a $ has the prime factorization $ a = p_1^{m_1} p_2^{m_2} \dots p_k^{m_k} $, and $ b = p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2} \dots p_k^{n_k} $. Then $ a^2 = p_1^{2m_1} p_2^{2m_2} \dots p_k^{2m_k} $, and $ b^3 = p_1^{3n_1} p_2^{3n_2} \dots p_k^{3n_k} $. Therefore, multiplying them together gives $ n = a^2b^3 = p_1^{2m_1 + 3n_1} p_2^{2m_2 + 3n_2} \dots p_k^{2m_k + 3n_k} $.

Therefore, for each prime $ p_i $, the exponent $ e_i $ in $ n $ must be equal to $ 2m_i + 3n_i $, where $ m_i $ and $ n_i $ are non-negative integers. So, the problem reduces to expressing each exponent $ e_i \geq 2 $ as a combination of twice some integer and thrice another integer. 

But how do I ensure that such $ m_i $ and $ n_i $ exist for each exponent $ e_i $? Let me think. For each exponent $ e_i $, I need integers $ m_i $ and $ n_i $ such that $ 2m_i + 3n_i = e_i $. Since $ e_i \geq 2 $, let me check for small values:

- If $ e_i = 2 $: Then $ 2m_i + 3n_i = 2 $. The only solution is $ m_i = 1 $, $ n_i = 0 $.
- If $ e_i = 3 $: Then $ 2m_i + 3n_i = 3 $. Solutions: $ m_i = 0 $, $ n_i = 1 $.
- If $ e_i = 4 $: $ 2m_i + 3n_i = 4 $. Solutions: $ m_i = 2 $, $ n_i = 0 $; or $ m_i = 0 $, $ n_i = 4/3 $, but that's not integer. So only $ m_i = 2 $, $ n_i = 0 $.
- If $ e_i = 5 $: $ 2m_i + 3n_i = 5 $. Let me try $ n_i = 1 $, then 2m_i = 2 => m_i = 1. So yes, $ m_i = 1 $, $ n_i = 1 $.
- $ e_i = 6 $: $ 2m_i + 3n_i = 6 $. Solutions: m_i = 0, n_i = 2; or m_i = 3, n_i = 0; or m_i = 1, n_i = 4/3... no. So multiple solutions.

So, in general, for any exponent $ e_i \geq 2 $, can we find non-negative integers $ m_i, n_i $ such that $ 2m_i + 3n_i = e_i $? Let me try to see if this is possible for all $ e_i \geq 2 $.

This seems like a linear Diophantine equation. The equation $ 2m + 3n = e $. Since 2 and 3 are coprime, for any integer $ e \geq (2*3 - 2 - 3) + 1 = 1 $, there are solutions. Wait, the Frobenius number for 2 and 3 is 1, meaning that all integers greater than or equal to 2 can be expressed as combinations of 2 and 3. But since we are looking for non-negative integers m and n, then yes, for any e ≥ 2, there are non-negative integers m and n such that 2m + 3n = e. Wait, but let me check for e=2, 3, 4, etc.

Wait, for e=2: 2*1 + 3*0 = 2. For e=3: 2*0 + 3*1=3. For e=4: 2*2 + 3*0=4. For e=5: 2*1 + 3*1=5. For e=6: 2*0 + 3*2=6 or 2*3 + 3*0=6. For e=7: 2*2 + 3*1=7. For e=8: 2*4 + 3*0=8 or 2*1 + 3*2=8. So yes, seems like for all e ≥ 2, there are non-negative integers m and n. Therefore, for each exponent in the prime factorization of n, we can write it as 2m_i + 3n_i, so that n can be written as a^2 b^3.

Therefore, if I take a to be the product of primes raised to m_i, and b to be the product of primes raised to n_i, then n = a^2 b^3. Therefore, every square-full number can be written in that form.

Wait, but let me check if this is correct. Let me take an example. Suppose n is square-full, say n = 36. Its prime factorization is 2^2 * 3^2. So each exponent is 2. For each prime, we can write 2 as 2*1 + 3*0. Therefore, a would be 2^1 * 3^0 = 2, and b would be 2^0 * 3^0 = 1. Therefore, n = a^2 b^3 = 2^2 * 1^3 = 4*1 = 4, which is not 36. Wait, that's not right. What did I do wrong here?

Wait, hold on. If n = a^2 b^3, then for n = 36, which is 2^2 * 3^2, we need to find a and b such that when you square a and cube b, you get 2^2 * 3^2. Let me think again. So, for each prime, the exponent in n is 2m_i + 3n_i. For the prime 2, exponent 2: 2m + 3n = 2. So m=1, n=0. Similarly for prime 3: 2m + 3n = 2. So m=1, n=0. Therefore, a is 2^1 * 3^1 = 6, and b is 2^0 * 3^0 = 1. Then a^2 b^3 = 6^2 * 1^3 = 36 * 1 = 36. Oh, right! I made a mistake earlier by thinking that a is 2 and b is 1, but actually, for each prime, the exponents in a and b are m_i and n_i. Therefore, for each prime, the exponents in a are m_i, so for 2, m_i=1, for 3, m_i=1. Therefore, a is 2^1 * 3^1 = 6. Then a^2 is 2^2 * 3^2, and b^3 is 1^3. Therefore, n is 36. That works. So my mistake was in the previous step where I thought a was 2 and b was 1, but actually, for each prime, the exponents in a are m_i, so for both primes, m_i is 1. Therefore, a is 2*3=6. So that works. 

Another example: take n = 12. Wait, but 12 is not square-full. Because 12 factors into 2^2 * 3^1. Since 3 divides 12, but 3^2 does not divide 12. Therefore, 12 is not square-full. So that's not a square-full number. Let me take a square-full number, say n = 36, which is square-full. Another example: n = 100 = 2^2 * 5^2. Then, similar to before, exponents are 2 and 2. So m_i for both primes is 1, n_i is 0. Therefore, a = 2*5 = 10, b = 1. Then a^2 b^3 = 100 * 1 = 100. Correct.

Another example: n = 2^3 * 3^3. This is square-full because each prime has exponent 3 ≥ 2. Let me write this as a^2 b^3. For each prime, exponent is 3. So 2m + 3n = 3. Solutions: m=0, n=1. Therefore, for both primes, m_i=0, n_i=1. Therefore, a = 2^0 * 3^0 = 1, b = 2^1 * 3^1 = 6. Then a^2 b^3 = 1^2 * 6^3 = 216. But n is 2^3 * 3^3 = 8*27 = 216. Correct. So that works.

Another example: n = 2^4 * 3^3. Let me check if this is square-full. For prime 2, exponent 4 ≥ 2, for prime 3, exponent 3 ≥ 2. So yes, square-full. Now, decompose exponents. For prime 2: 4 = 2m + 3n. Let's find m and n. For example, m=2, n=0 (since 2*2 + 3*0 = 4). For prime 3: 3 = 2m + 3n. So m=0, n=1. Therefore, a is 2^2 * 3^0 = 4, and b is 2^0 * 3^1 = 3. Therefore, a^2 b^3 = 4^2 * 3^3 = 16 * 27 = 432. But n is 2^4 * 3^3 = 16 * 27 = 432. Correct.

Another example: n = 2^5 * 3^4. Let me check. For prime 2: 5 = 2m + 3n. Let's find m and n. Let me try n=1: 2m + 3 = 5 => 2m = 2 => m=1. So m=1, n=1. For prime 3: 4 = 2m + 3n. Let me try n=0: 2m = 4 => m=2. So m=2, n=0. Therefore, a is 2^1 * 3^2 = 2*9 = 18, and b is 2^1 * 3^0 = 2. Then a^2 b^3 = (18)^2 * (2)^3 = 324 * 8 = 2592. Let me check the original n: 2^5 * 3^4 = 32 * 81 = 2592. Correct.

So this seems to work. Therefore, the key idea is that for each exponent in the prime factorization of n, which is at least 2, we can write it as 2m + 3n for non-negative integers m and n, and then set a to be the product of primes raised to m_i and b to be the product of primes raised to n_i. Therefore, n can be written as a^2 b^3.

But let me think again about the general case. Suppose n has prime factorization $ n = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{e_i} $, with each $ e_i \geq 2 $. For each exponent $ e_i $, we can find non-negative integers $ m_i $ and $ n_i $ such that $ e_i = 2m_i + 3n_i $. Then, set $ a = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{m_i} $ and $ b = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{n_i} $. Then, $ a^2 = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{2m_i} $ and $ b^3 = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{3n_i} $, so multiplying them gives $ n = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{2m_i + 3n_i} = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{e_i} $. Therefore, this works.

But how do I know that such $ m_i $ and $ n_i $ exist for each $ e_i $? As I thought before, since 2 and 3 are coprime, for any integer $ e \geq 2 $, there exist non-negative integers $ m $ and $ n $ such that $ 2m + 3n = e $. Wait, but is that true? Let me check for e=2, yes. e=3, yes. For e=4, 2*2 + 3*0 = 4. For e=5, 2*1 + 3*1=5. For e=6, 2*0 + 3*2=6. For e=7, 2*2 + 3*1=7. For e=8, 2*4 + 3*0=8 or 2*1 + 3*2=8. For e=9, 2*0 + 3*3=9. For e=10, 2*2 + 3*2=10. So yes, seems like for any e ≥ 2, you can find non-negative integers m and n. 

But to be thorough, let me think about the general case. Suppose e is any integer ≥ 2. Let me think of solving 2m + 3n = e. Let me fix n and solve for m. For example, if e is even, then n can be 0, and m = e/2. If e is odd, then since 3n must be odd, n must be odd. Let me write e = 2m + 3n. Let me suppose that n is as large as possible. For example, take n = floor(e / 3). But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, since 2 and 3 are coprime, the equation 2m + 3n = e has solutions in integers for any e ≥ (2*3 - 2 - 3) + 1 = 1. Wait, the Frobenius number for 2 and 3 is 1, so all integers greater than 1 can be expressed as combinations of 2 and 3. However, since we need non-negative integers, the question is whether for e ≥ 2, there are non-negative solutions. 

But since e ≥ 2, and for e=2, 2*1 + 3*0=2, which is valid. For e=3, 2*0 + 3*1=3. For e ≥ 4, since 2 and 3 are coprime, and 4=2*2 + 3*0, 5=2*1 + 3*1, 6=2*0 + 3*2, etc. So yes, for all e ≥ 2, there are non-negative integer solutions. Therefore, the decomposition is possible.

Therefore, this shows that any square-full number can be written as $ a^2 b^3 $. 

But let me check another example where exponents are larger. Let me take e=7. For e=7, 2m + 3n =7. Let me take n=1, then 2m=4, so m=2. Therefore, m=2, n=1. So if I have a prime with exponent 7, then a would have exponent 2, and b would have exponent 1. Therefore, in the overall number, that prime would be raised to 2*2 + 3*1 = 4 + 3 = 7. Correct.

Another example: e=10. 2m + 3n=10. Let me take n=0: m=5. Or n=2: 3*2=6, so 2m=4, m=2. So either way. So yes, possible.

Therefore, the conclusion is that every square-full number can be written in the form $ a^2 b^3 $, where a and b are positive integers.

But let me think again if there is any possible mistake here. Suppose that someone says that maybe there is a case where the decomposition is not possible? But since for each exponent, we can find m and n, and since the exponents are all at least 2, then the decomposition is always possible. Therefore, this should hold.

Alternatively, maybe there is a more formal way to write this. For example, using the fact that any integer ≥ 2 can be expressed as 2m + 3n with m, n ≥ 0. Therefore, for each prime in the factorization of n, we can write its exponent as 2m + 3n, then set a and b accordingly.

Alternatively, think of the exponents in terms of the exponents in a^2 and b^3. Since a^2 contributes even exponents and b^3 contributes multiples of 3. Therefore, combining them, the exponents in n are the sum of an even number and a multiple of 3. So for each prime, the exponent is congruent to 0 mod 1 (since any integer is congruent to 0 mod 1). But that's trivial. However, since exponents are at least 2, we need to write them as 2m + 3n. Which is possible as we saw.

Alternatively, think of the exponents in terms of the exponents in a and b. For each prime p_i, in n, the exponent e_i is equal to 2m_i + 3n_i. Therefore, if I set m_i = floor(e_i / 2) or something? Not necessarily. But since we can find such m_i and n_i for each e_i, then this decomposition is possible.

Therefore, I think this is correct. Therefore, the answer is that every square-full number can be written as $ a^2 b^3 $, with a and b positive integers.

But let me check the given number: there are 992 square-full numbers less than 250,000. Maybe that's just extra info, but not needed for the proof. The problem says "show that it can be written in the form...", so the main task is to show that decomposition.

Therefore, the conclusion is that any square-full number can be expressed as $ a^2 b^3 $, which is proven by decomposing each exponent in the prime factorization into 2m + 3n, then setting a and b accordingly. Therefore, the answer is that such a representation exists.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{n = a^2b^3}
</think>

To show that every **square-full** number can be written in the form $ n = a^2 b^3 $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are positive integers, we begin by analyzing the definition of a square-full number.

---

### **Definition and Key Insight**

A positive integer $ n $ is **square-full** if for every prime $ p $ dividing $ n $, $ p^2 \mid n $. This implies that in the prime factorization of $ n $, each exponent must be **at least 2**. That is, if $ n = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{e_i} $, then $ e_i \geq 2 $ for all $ i $.

---

### **Objective**

We are to show that every such $ n $ can be written in the form:

$$
n = a^2 b^3
$$

where $ a, b \in \mathbb{Z}^+ $.

---

### **Decomposing Exponents**

Let’s consider the prime factorization of $ n $:

$$
n = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{e_i}
$$

We aim to write this as $ a^2 b^3 $, which means that the exponents in $ n $ must be expressible as the sum of twice an integer and thrice another integer:

$$
e_i = 2m_i + 3n_i
$$

for non-negative integers $ m_i, n_i $. If this is possible for all $ e_i \geq 2 $, then we can define:

$$
a = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{m_i}, \quad b = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{n_i}
$$

Then:

$$
a^2 = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{2m_i}, \quad b^3 = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{3n_i}
$$

and so:

$$
a^2 b^3 = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{2m_i + 3n_i} = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{e_i} = n
$$

---

### **Existence of Solutions**

We now show that for each $ e_i \geq 2 $, there exist non-negative integers $ m_i, n_i $ such that:

$$
2m_i + 3n_i = e_i
$$

This is a classic linear Diophantine equation. Since 2 and 3 are coprime, the equation has solutions for all $ e_i \geq 2 $. Moreover, since we are only interested in **non-negative** integer solutions, we can always find such $ m_i, n_i $ by choosing appropriate values.

For example:
- $ e = 2 \Rightarrow m = 1, n = 0 $
- $ e = 3 \Rightarrow m = 0, n = 1 $
- $ e = 4 \Rightarrow m = 2, n = 0 $
- $ e = 5 \Rightarrow m = 1, n = 1 $
- $ e = 6 \Rightarrow m = 0, n = 2 $, etc.

Hence, for every $ e_i \geq 2 $, such a decomposition exists.

---

### **Conclusion**

Given that every square-full number has a prime factorization with all exponents $ \geq 2 $, and that each such exponent can be written as $ 2m + 3n $, we can construct $ a $ and $ b $ such that:

$$
n = a^2 b^3
$$

Thus, **every square-full number can be written in the form $ a^2 b^3 $** with $ a, b \in \mathbb{Z}^+ $.

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{n = a^2b^3}
$$
