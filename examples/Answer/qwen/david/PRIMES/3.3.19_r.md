Okay, so I need to express the integers 25, 69, 81, and 125 as sums of distinct odd primes. The problem mentions that in 1950, it was proved that any integer n â‰¥ 9 can be written as such a sum. So, I need to find combinations of distinct odd primes that add up to each of these numbers. Let me start with the first one, which is 25.

First, let me recall that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The odd primes start from 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, etc. Since we need distinct primes, I can't use the same prime more than once. Also, since we are dealing with sums of odd primes, the sum of odd numbers is even if there are an even number of terms, and odd if there are an odd number of terms. Since 25 is odd, we need an odd number of odd primes in the sum. So, for example, 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + ... but wait, let me check.

Wait, 25 is odd. So, if I use an odd number of odd primes, their sum will be odd. Since all primes except 2 are odd, but 2 is even. However, since we are supposed to use odd primes, we can't use 2. Therefore, all primes in the sum are odd, so the number of terms must be odd. So, for example, 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + ... but let me think of specific combinations.

Let me try to find a combination for 25. Let's start with the largest possible prime less than 25 and see if the remaining can be expressed as a sum of distinct smaller odd primes.

The largest prime less than 25 is 23. Let me try 23. Then 25 - 23 = 2. But 2 is not an odd prime (it's even). So that doesn't work. Next, try 19. Then 25 - 19 = 6. Now, can 6 be expressed as a sum of distinct odd primes? The primes less than 6 are 3 and 5. 5 + 3 = 8, which is too big. 5 is 5, and 3 is 3. 5 + 3 is 8, which is more than 6. So maybe 3 + 3, but that's repeating primes. Not allowed. So 6 can't be expressed as a sum of distinct odd primes. So 19 is not working.

Next prime down is 17. 25 - 17 = 8. Again, trying to express 8 as sum of distinct odd primes. The primes less than 8 are 3, 5, 7. Let's try 7 + 3 = 10, which is too big. 5 + 3 = 8. Yes! 5 + 3 = 8. So 17 + 5 + 3 = 25. Let me check that: 17 + 5 is 22, plus 3 is 25. Yes. So that works. So 25 can be written as 3 + 5 + 17. Alternatively, maybe other combinations? Let me check another way.

Alternatively, starting with smaller primes. Let's try 3 + 5 + 7 + ... Let me see. 3 + 5 + 7 is 15, then 25 - 15 = 10. 10 can be written as 7 + 3, but those are already used. Wait, 10 can be 5 + 5, but that's repeating. Or 7 + 3, but again already used. Alternatively, maybe 3 + 5 + 7 + 11? Wait, 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 is 26, which is over 25. So that's too much. Maybe 3 + 5 + 7 + something else? 3 + 5 + 7 = 15, so 25 - 15 = 10. If I use 10 as 5 + 5, but duplicates. Not allowed. Alternatively, 3 + 5 + 7 + 3? No, duplicates. Hmm. So maybe that approach isn't working. So maybe the first combination is better: 3 + 5 + 17.

Alternatively, maybe 3 + 11 + 11? No, duplicates. 5 + 7 + 13? 5 + 7 + 13 is 25. Wait, 5 + 7 is 12, plus 13 is 25. Yes! That's another combination: 5 + 7 + 13. Let me check that. 5 + 7 is 12, plus 13 is 25. Yes, that works. So that's another way. So there are multiple ways. The problem just says "express" so any valid combination is okay. So maybe I can pick one of them.

So for 25, I can use 3 + 5 + 17 or 5 + 7 + 13. Either is fine. Let me note that down.

Now moving on to 69. Let me try to find a combination for 69. Again, starting with the largest prime less than 69. The largest prime less than 69 is 67. Then 69 - 67 = 2. Again, 2 is not an odd prime. So that doesn't work. Next prime is 61. 69 - 61 = 8. Again, trying to express 8 as sum of distinct odd primes. As before, 5 + 3 = 8. So 61 + 5 + 3 = 69. Let me check: 61 + 5 is 66, plus 3 is 69. Yes. So that's a valid combination. Alternatively, maybe other combinations. Let me check if there are others.

Alternatively, maybe starting with smaller primes. Let me try 7 + 11 + 13 + ... Let me think. Maybe 7 + 11 + 13 + 19 + ... Let me try adding primes until I get close to 69. Let me try 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19. Let me add those up: 7 + 11 is 18, +13 is 31, +17 is 48, +19 is 67. Then 69 - 67 is 2. Again, 2 is not allowed. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe replace 19 with a larger prime? But 19 is already the largest in that set. Alternatively, maybe use a different combination. Let me try 7 + 11 + 13 + 23. Let me add those: 7 + 11 is 18, +13 is 31, +23 is 54. Then 69 - 54 is 15. 15 can be 11 + 3 + ... but 11 is already used. 7 + 5 + 3? 7 + 5 + 3 is 15. But 7 and 5 and 3 are not used yet? Wait, in this case, the primes used so far are 7, 11, 13, 23. So 3 is not used. So 3 + 5 + 7? But 7 is already used. So maybe 3 + 5 + 7 is not allowed. Alternatively, 5 + 11? But 11 is already used. Hmm. Maybe 3 + 11 + 1? No, 1 is not prime. Alternatively, maybe 5 + 13? 5 + 13 is 18, but 69 - 54 is 15. So 15 can be 5 + 11, but 11 is already used. Alternatively, 3 + 5 + 7? But 7 is already used. Maybe this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, maybe try another combination. Let me try 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + ... Let me see. Let me add some primes. Let me try 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17. Let's calculate that: 3 + 5 is 8, +7 is 15, +11 is 26, +13 is 39, +17 is 56. Then 69 - 56 is 13. But 13 is already in the sum. So can't use it again. Hmm. Maybe replace 17 with a larger prime? Let me try 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 19. Let's add them: 3 + 5 is 8, +7 is 15, +11 is 26, +13 is 39, +19 is 58. Then 69 - 58 is 11. 11 is already in the sum. Not allowed. Alternatively, replace 19 with 23? Then 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 23 = 3 + 5 is 8, +7 is 15, +11 is 26, +13 is 39, +23 is 62. Then 69 - 62 is 7, which is already in the sum. Not allowed. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe use a different set. Let me think. Let me try starting with 61 + 5 + 3 as before, which gives 69. That seems straightforward. So maybe that's the easiest way. Let me check if that's correct. 61 is prime, 5 is prime, 3 is prime. All distinct. 61 + 5 + 3 = 69. Yes, that works. So that's a valid combination. So maybe that's the one to go with.

Alternatively, maybe another combination. For example, 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 3. Let me check that sum. 7 + 11 is 18, +13 is 31, +17 is 48, +19 is 67, +3 is 70. That's over by 1. Not helpful. Alternatively, 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 3 - 1? Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 - 1? Not helpful. Maybe another approach. Let me think.

Alternatively, 69 can be written as 7 + 11 + 13 + 19 + 19? No, duplicates. 7 + 11 + 13 + 19 + 5? Let me add those: 7 + 11 is 18, +13 is 31, +19 is 50, +5 is 55. Then 69 - 55 is 14. 14 can be 11 + 3, but 11 is already used. 7 + 7, duplicates. Not helpful. Maybe 7 + 11 + 13 + 23 + 11? No, duplicates again. Hmm. Maybe 7 + 11 + 13 + 23 + 5? Let me add them: 7 + 11 is 18, +13 is 31, +23 is 54, +5 is 59. Then 69 - 59 is 10. 10 can be 5 + 5, duplicates. Or 7 + 3, but 7 is already used. 3 + 7? Same thing. Not helpful. Maybe 7 + 11 + 13 + 23 + 5 + 3? Let me check that sum: 7 + 11 is 18, +13 is 31, +23 is 54, +5 is 59, +3 is 62. Then 69 - 62 is 7, which is already in the sum. Not helpful.

So maybe the first combination is the easiest. 61 + 5 + 3 = 69. So that's valid. Let me note that.

Now moving on to 81. Let me try to find a combination for 81. Again, starting with the largest prime less than 81, which is 79. Then 81 - 79 = 2. Again, 2 is not an odd prime. So that doesn't work. Next prime is 73. 81 - 73 = 8. Again, trying to express 8 as sum of distinct odd primes. 5 + 3 = 8. So 73 + 5 + 3 = 81. Let me check: 73 + 5 is 78, +3 is 81. Yes. That works. Alternatively, maybe other combinations. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe start with smaller primes. Let me try 3 + 5 + 7 + ... Let me think. Let me try adding primes until I get close to 81. Let's try 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + ... Let me add them up step by step. 3 + 5 is 8, +7 is 15, +11 is 26, +13 is 39, +17 is 56, +19 is 75, +23 is 98. That's over 81. So maybe replace 23 with something smaller. Let me try 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19. Let me add those: 3 + 5 is 8, +7 is 15, +11 is 26, +13 is 39, +17 is 56, +19 is 75. Then 81 - 75 is 6. 6 can be 3 + 3, but duplicates. Or 5 + 1? Not prime. So that doesn't work. Alternatively, maybe replace 19 with a smaller prime? Let me try 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 13? No, duplicate 13. Not allowed. Alternatively, 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 - something? Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe use a different combination. Let me try 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23. Let me add those: 7 + 11 is 18, +13 is 31, +17 is 48, +19 is 67, +23 is 90. That's over 81. So maybe replace 23 with a smaller prime. Let me try 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 19? No, duplicates. 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 17? No. Alternatively, 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 13? No. Maybe replace 19 with 17? But that would be duplicate. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 5? Let me add that: 7 + 11 is 18, +13 is 31, +17 is 48, +19 is 67, +5 is 72. Then 81 - 72 is 9. 9 can be 7 + 2? 2 isn't prime. 5 + 4? Not prime. 3 + 3 + 3? Not allowed. 3 + 5 + 1? Not helpful. So that's not working.

Alternatively, maybe 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 23. Let me add those: 7 + 11 is 18, +13 is 31, +17 is 48, +23 is 71. Then 81 - 71 is 10. 10 can be 5 + 5, duplicates. Or 7 + 3, but 7 is already used. 5 + 3 + 2? Not helpful. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe use 73 + 5 + 3 as before. That seems straightforward. Let me check again. 73 + 5 + 3 = 81. Yes, that works. So that's a valid combination. Alternatively, maybe another combination. Let me try 7 + 11 + 13 + 19 + 23 + 7? No, duplicates. 7 + 11 + 13 + 19 + 23 + 5? Let me add those: 7 + 11 is 18, +13 is 31, +19 is 50, +23 is 73, +5 is 78. Then 81 - 78 is 3. So 3 is prime. So that would be 7 + 11 + 13 + 19 + 23 + 5 + 3. Let me check that sum: 7 + 11 + 13 + 19 + 23 + 5 + 3. Let me add them step by step. 7 + 11 is 18, +13 is 31, +19 is 50, +23 is 73, +5 is 78, +3 is 81. Yes! That works. So that's another combination: 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 19 + 23. All distinct primes. So that's another way. So maybe that's a longer combination, but it's valid.

So for 81, I can use either 73 + 5 + 3 or the longer combination with more primes. Either is acceptable.

Now moving on to 125. Let me try to find a combination for 125. Again, starting with the largest prime less than 125, which is 113. Then 125 - 113 = 12. Now, trying to express 12 as a sum of distinct odd primes. Let me think. The primes less than 12 are 3, 5, 7, 11. Let's see. 11 + 1? Not prime. 7 + 5 = 12. Yes! So 113 + 7 + 5 = 125. Let me check: 113 + 7 is 120, +5 is 125. Yes, that works. Alternatively, 11 + 3 + 5 + 3? No, duplicates. 11 + 3 + 5 + ... 11 + 3 + 5 is 19, which is less than 12. Wait, no. Wait, 12 is the target. So 7 + 5 = 12. So that's the way. So 113 + 7 + 5 is valid.

Alternatively, maybe another combination. Let me try starting with a smaller prime. Let me try 109. Then 125 - 109 = 16. Trying to express 16 as sum of distinct odd primes. Let's see. 11 + 5 = 16. So 109 + 11 + 5 = 125. Let me check: 109 + 11 is 120, +5 is 125. Yes, that works. Alternatively, 7 + 5 + 3 + 1? No. 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 is invalid. 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 is not primes. 7 + 5 + 3 + 1? 1 is not prime. 7 + 5 + 3 + 1 is invalid. Alternatively, 7 + 7 + 2? Not allowed. So 11 + 5 is the way. So that's another combination.

Alternatively, maybe 125 can be written as sum of more primes. Let me try another approach. Let me try using 7 + 11 + 13 + ... Let me try adding primes until I get close to 125. Let me try 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31. Let me add them up. Let me do step by step:

7 + 11 = 18

+13 = 31

+17 = 48

+19 = 67

+23 = 90

+29 = 119

+31 = 150. That's over 125. So maybe replace 31 with a smaller prime. Let me try 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29. Let me add them:

7 + 11 = 18

+13 = 31

+17 = 48

+19 = 67

+23 = 90

+29 = 119. Then 125 - 119 = 6. 6 can be 3 + 3, but duplicates. Or 5 + 1? Not prime. So that doesn't work. Alternatively, maybe replace 29 with 23? But 23 is already in the sum. Not allowed. Alternatively, replace 29 with 19? But 19 is already in the sum. Not allowed. Alternatively, maybe replace 23 with a smaller prime. Let me try 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 19? No, duplicates. Alternatively, 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 17? No. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe use a different set of primes. Let me try 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29. Let me add them up:

3 + 5 = 8

+7 = 15

+11 = 26

+13 = 39

+17 = 56

+19 = 75

+23 = 98

+29 = 127. That's over 125 by 2. So maybe remove 29 and add something else? 127 - 2 = 125. So if I remove 29 and add 2? But 2 is not allowed. Alternatively, replace 29 with 23? But 23 is already in the sum. Not allowed. Alternatively, replace 29 with 19? Already in the sum. Hmm. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 - 2? Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe another combination. Let me try 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23. Let me add those:

3 + 5 = 8

+7 = 15

+11 = 26

+13 = 39

+17 = 56

+19 = 75

+23 = 98. Then 125 - 98 = 27. 27 can be 13 + 11 + 3, but those are already used. Or 17 + 5 + 5? Duplicates. Or 7 + 11 + 9? Not prime. Or 23 + 2? Not allowed. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 23 + 29. Let me add those:

3 + 5 = 8

+7 = 15

+11 = 26

+13 = 39

+17 = 56

+23 = 79

+29 = 108. Then 125 - 108 = 17. 17 is already in the sum. Not allowed. Alternatively, replace 29 with 19? Then 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 23 + 19. Let me add them:

3 + 5 = 8

+7 = 15

+11 = 26

+13 = 39

+17 = 56

+23 = 79

+19 = 98. Then 125 - 98 = 27. Again, same problem.

Alternatively, maybe start with 113 + 7 + 5 as before. That seems straightforward. Let me check again. 113 is prime, 7 is prime, 5 is prime. All distinct. 113 + 7 + 5 = 125. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe another combination. Let me try 109 + 11 + 5 = 125, as before. Also valid. Alternatively, 101 + something. Let me try 101. 125 - 101 = 24. Trying to express 24 as sum of distinct odd primes. Let me think. 24 can be 11 + 13 = 24. So 101 + 11 + 13 = 125. Let me check: 101 + 11 is 112, +13 is 125. Yes, that works. So that's another combination.

Alternatively, 101 + 7 + 11 + 5 + 3? Let me check that sum. 101 + 7 is 108, +11 is 119, +5 is 124, +3 is 127. That's over. So maybe 101 + 7 + 11 + 5? 101 + 7 + 11 + 5 = 124. Then 125 - 124 = 1. Not prime. Not helpful. Alternatively, 101 + 7 + 11 + 5 + 1? No. Not helpful.

Alternatively, 101 + 13 + 7 + 3? Let me add them: 101 + 13 is 114, +7 is 121, +3 is 124. Again, 125 - 124 = 1. Not helpful.

Alternatively, 101 + 17 + 5 + 2? No, 2 is not allowed. So maybe 101 + 17 + 5 + 3? 101 + 17 is 118, +5 is 123, +3 is 126. Over by 1. Not helpful.

Alternatively, 101 + 19 + 5? 101 + 19 is 120, +5 is 125. Yes! So that's another combination: 101 + 19 + 5 = 125. Let me check: 101 + 19 is 120, +5 is 125. Yes. So that's valid. So that's another way. So 101 + 19 + 5.

Alternatively, 101 + 13 + 11 = 125 as before. So multiple combinations.

So for 125, there are several possibilities. The simplest ones are 113 + 7 + 5, 109 + 11 + 5, 101 + 13 + 11, 101 + 19 + 5, etc.

So, to recap:

For 25: 3 + 5 + 17 or 5 + 7 + 13.

For 69: 3 + 5 + 61 or other combinations like 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 19 + 23.

For 81: 3 + 5 + 73 or 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 19 + 23.

For 125: 5 + 7 + 113, 5 + 11 + 109, 11 + 13 + 101, 5 + 19 + 101, etc.

But the problem says "Express the integers 25, 69, 81, and 125 in this fashion." So I need to provide one valid expression for each. Let me pick one for each.

For 25: Let me go with 3 + 5 + 17.

For 69: 3 + 5 + 61.

For 81: 3 + 5 + 73.

For 125: 5 + 7 + 113.

Alternatively, maybe check if these are all valid. Let me verify each:

25: 3 + 5 + 17 = 25. Correct.

69: 3 + 5 + 61 = 69. Correct.

81: 3 + 5 + 73 = 81. Correct.

125: 5 + 7 + 113 = 125. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe check if there are any duplicates or if primes are distinct. All primes in each case are distinct. For example, in 25, 3, 5, 17 are all distinct primes. Same for others.

Alternatively, for 125, another combination is 11 + 13 + 101. 11 + 13 = 24, +101 = 125. Yes, that's also valid. But the question just requires one expression, so any of them is acceptable.

Therefore, the answer can be presented as:

25 = 3 + 5 + 17

69 = 3 + 5 + 61

81 = 3 + 5 + 73

125 = 5 + 7 + 113

Alternatively, maybe check if there are any other constraints. The problem says "sum of distinct odd primes". Since all the primes used are odd (excluding 2, which is even, but we aren't using it here), and they are distinct. So all these combinations are valid.

Therefore, I think these are correct. Let me just check once again each sum:

25: 3 + 5 = 8, +17 = 25. Correct.

69: 3 + 5 = 8, +61 = 69. Correct.

81: 3 + 5 = 8, +73 = 81. Correct.

125: 5 + 7 = 12, +113 = 125. Correct.

Yes, all correct. Therefore, these are valid representations.

**Final Answer**

The integers can be expressed as follows:
- $25 = \boxed{3 + 5 + 17}$
- $69 = \boxed{3 + 5 + 61}$
- $81 = \boxed{3 + 5 + 73}$
- $125 = \boxed{5 + 7 + 113}$

However, since the problem asks to express each integer in this fashion and present the final answer within a single box, perhaps each number should be boxed individually. But the instructions say "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Maybe the user expects each number to be boxed separately? But the original problem says "Express the integers 25, 69, 81, and 125 in this fashion." So maybe each expression is to be boxed. However, the standard practice for such problems is to present each expression in a box. However, since the user might expect a single answer, perhaps list them all in one box separated by commas. But the exact instruction is ambiguous. However, looking at the problem again, the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". So maybe each number's expression is to be boxed. But since there are four numbers, perhaps the answer is four boxed expressions. However, the standard way here might be to present each as a separate boxed expression. However, in the initial problem statement, the user might expect each number's expression in a box. However, the exact format is unclear. But given that the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", and given that multiple answers are required, maybe each expression is boxed separately.

But in the context of the platform, maybe each number is to be expressed in a box. However, the original problem says "Express the integers 25, 69, 81, and 125 in this fashion." So the answer is four expressions. However, the user instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Maybe each expression is to be boxed, but since there are four, perhaps:

\boxed{3 + 5 + 17}, \boxed{3 + 5 + 61}, \boxed{3 + 5 + 73}, \boxed{5 + 7 + 113}

But I need to check if that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects each number to be represented as a sum in a single box. However, given that the original problem says "Express the integers... in this fashion", and given that the user might expect each number's expression, I think the appropriate way is to present each as a separate boxed expression.

But since the user might have a different expectation, but given the initial instruction, I think the answer should be each of the four expressions boxed.

**Final Answer**
The integers can be expressed as:
- $25 = \boxed{3 + 5 + 17}$
- $69 = \boxed{3 + 5 + 61}$
- $81 = \boxed{3 + 5 + 73}$
- $125 = \boxed{5 + 7 + 113}$
</think>

To express the integers 25, 69, 81, and 125 as the sum of **distinct odd primes**, we must find combinations of **distinct odd prime numbers** that add up to each of these values.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### **25**
We seek a sum of **distinct odd primes** that equals 25.

- Try the largest prime less than 25: 17.  
  $ 25 - 17 = 8 $  
  Now, find two distinct odd primes that sum to 8:  
  $ 5 + 3 = 8 $  
  So:  
  $ 25 = 3 + 5 + 17 $

âœ… **Valid and distinct primes.**

#### **69**
Find a sum of **distinct odd primes** that equals 69.

- Try the largest prime less than 69: 61.  
  $ 69 - 61 = 8 $  
  Again, $ 5 + 3 = 8 $  
  So:  
  $ 69 = 3 + 5 + 61 $

âœ… **Valid and distinct primes.**

---

#### **81**
Find a sum of **distinct odd primes** that equals 81.

- Try the largest prime less than 81: 73.  
  $ 81 - 73 = 8 $  
  Again, $ 5 + 3 = 8 $  
  So:  
  $ 81 = 3 + 5 + 73 $

âœ… **Valid and distinct primes.**

---

#### **125**
Find a sum of **distinct odd primes** that equals 125.

- Try the largest prime less than 125: 113.  
  $ 125 - 113 = 12 $  
  Now, find two distinct odd primes that sum to 12:  
  $ 7 + 5 = 12 $  
  So:  
  $ 125 = 5 + 7 + 113 $

âœ… **Valid and distinct primes.**
