Okay, so I need to find five instances where two consecutive prime gaps are equal. The problem says that this is an open question whether there are infinitely many such cases, but I need to provide five examples. Let me start by recalling what prime gaps are. The nth prime gap, d_n, is the difference between the (n+1)th prime and the nth prime. So, for example, the first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc. So the gaps between them are 1 (3-2), 2 (5-3), 2 (7-5), 4 (11-7), 2 (13-11), 4 (17-13), 2 (19-17), 4 (23-19), 6 (29-23), etc. 

Looking at these gaps, I can see that there are instances where consecutive gaps are equal. For example, between the first and second prime, the gap is 1, then the next gap is 2. Then the next gap is also 2. So between the second and third prime (3 to 5) and between the third and fourth prime (5 to 7), the gaps are both 2. So that's one instance where d_n = d_{n+1}. Similarly, looking further, maybe there are more?

Wait, let me check. Let me list out the gaps with their indices. Let me make a table:

n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,...

p_n: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71,...

d_n: 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 6, 2, 4, 2, 12, 2, 4, 6,...

So, looking at the gaps:

d_1 = 1, d_2 = 2, d_3 = 2, so d_2 = d_3. That's one case where d_n = d_{n+1} for n=2.

Then d_3=2, d_4=4, not equal. d_4=4, d_5=2, not equal. d_5=2, d_6=4, nope. d_6=4, d_7=2, nope. d_7=2, d_8=4, nope. d_8=4, d_9=6, nope. d_9=6, d_10=6. So here, d_9 = d_10. That's another case, n=9.

Then d_10=6, d_11=4, nope. d_11=4, d_12=6, nope. d_12=6, d_13=2, nope. d_13=2, d_14=4, nope. d_14=4, d_15=2, nope. d_15=2, d_16=12, nope. d_16=12, d_17=2, nope. d_17=2, d_18=4, nope. d_18=4, d_19=6, nope. d_19=6, d_20=4, nope. 

So so far, I have two cases: n=2 (d_2 = d_3 = 2) and n=9 (d_9 = d_10 = 6). But the problem asks for five solutions. So I need to find more instances where consecutive gaps are equal. Maybe I need to look further into the primes.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall some known cases or think about how primes are distributed. For example, twin primes are primes that are two apart, so that would correspond to gaps of 2. So if there are twin primes in consecutive positions, that would be a case where d_n = d_{n+1} = 2. However, twin primes are primes that are two apart, but they don't necessarily have to be consecutive in the sequence of primes. For example, 3 and 5 are twin primes, but they are consecutive primes. Then 5 and 7 are twin primes, also consecutive. Then 11 and 13, etc. However, if there is a case where two twin primes are followed by another twin prime? Wait, no. For example, if there is a prime p, then p+2 is the next prime, then p+4 is the next prime? Wait, but p+4 would be the next prime after p+2? That would mean that there is a gap of 2 between p and p+2, then another gap of 2 between p+2 and p+4. But that would require that p+4 is prime. However, if p is 3, then p+2 is 5, and p+4 is 7, which is prime. So that would be the case of 3, 5, 7. So here, between the second and third prime (d_2 = 2), and between the third and fourth prime (d_3 = 2). Wait, that's exactly the first case I found earlier. So that's n=2. Similarly, if there's a sequence of three primes where the first two are twin primes and the next two are twin primes, but that would require that p, p+2, p+4 are all primes. However, except for the case of 3, 5, 7, there are no such primes because if p is 5, then p+2 is 7, p+4 is 9, which is not prime. Similarly, p=7, p+2=9 not prime. So the only case where three primes in a row have gaps of 2 is 3,5,7. So that's one case.

But then, for other gaps. For example, gaps of 4. Let's see. For example, between 7 and 11 is 4, then between 11 and 13 is 2. Not equal. Between 13 and 17 is 4, then 17 to 19 is 2. Not equal. Then 19 to 23 is 4, then 23 to 29 is 6. Not equal. Then 29 to 31 is 2, 31 to 37 is 6. Not equal. 37 to 41 is 4, then 41 to 43 is 2. Not equal. 43 to 47 is 4, then 47 to 53 is 6. Not equal. 53 to 59 is 6, then 59 to 61 is 2. Not equal. 61 to 67 is 6, then 67 to 71 is 4. Not equal. So maybe there's another place where two gaps of 4 are consecutive? Let me check further.

Looking at the gaps list I had before:

d_9 = 6, d_10 = 6. So that's two gaps of 6. So that's another case. So that's n=9. Then d_10=6, d_11=4. Not equal. d_11=4, d_12=6. Not equal. d_12=6, d_13=2. Not equal. d_13=2, d_14=4. Not equal. d_14=4, d_15=2. Not equal. d_15=2, d_16=12. Not equal. d_16=12, d_17=2. Not equal. d_17=2, d_18=4. Not equal. d_18=4, d_19=6. Not equal. d_19=6, d_20=4. Not equal. 

So maybe I need to go further. Let me check more primes. Let me try to list more primes. Let me check the primes after 71:

71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 523, 541,...

Now let me compute the gaps between these primes:

Okay, so now looking through these gaps:

Looking for consecutive equal gaps. Let me check:

From earlier, we had:

n=2: d_2=2, d_3=2

n=9: d_9=6, d_10=6

Looking further in the list:

Looking at the gaps from n=20 onwards:

d_20=2, d_21=6 (no)

d_21=6, d_22=4 (no)

d_22=4, d_23=6 (no)

d_23=6, d_24=8 (no)

d_24=8, d_25=4 (no)

d_25=4, d_26=2 (no)

d_26=2, d_27=4 (no)

d_27=4, d_28=2 (no)

d_28=2, d_29=4 (no)

d_29=4, d_30=14 (no)

d_30=14, d_31=4 (no)

d_31=4, d_32=6 (no)

d_32=6, d_33=2 (no)

d_33=2, d_34=10 (no)

d_34=10, d_35=2 (no)

d_35=2, d_36=6 (no)

d_36=6, d_37=6 (yes! d_36=6, d_37=6. So that's another case where n=36. So that's the third case.

Then d_37=6, d_38=4 (no)

d_38=4, d_39=6 (no)

d_39=6, d_40=6 (yes! d_39=6, d_40=6. So that's n=39. Fourth case.

Then d_40=6, d_41=2 (no)

d_41=2, d_42=10 (no)

d_42=10, d_43=2 (no)

d_43=2, d_44=4 (no)

d_44=4, d_45=2 (no)

d_45=2, d_46=12 (no)

d_46=12, d_47=12 (yes! d_46=12, d_47=12. So that's n=46. Fifth case.

So that gives me five solutions: n=2, 9, 36, 39, 46. Let me verify these:

For n=2: p_2=3, p_3=5, so d_2=5-3=2. p_3=5, p_4=7, d_3=7-5=2. So yes, d_2=d_3=2.

For n=9: p_9=23, p_10=29, so d_9=29-23=6. p_10=29, p_11=31, d_10=31-29=2? Wait, no! Wait, hold on, earlier I thought d_9=6 and d_10=6. But according to the list I made earlier, p_9=23, p_10=29, so d_9=6. Then p_10=29, p_11=31, so d_10=2? Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, let me check the primes again. Wait, p_1=2, p_2=3, p_3=5, p_4=7, p_5=11, p_6=13, p_7=17, p_8=19, p_9=23, p_10=29, p_11=31, p_12=37, p_13=41, p_14=43, p_15=47, p_16=53, p_17=59, p_18=61, p_19=67, p_20=71, p_21=73, p_22=79, p_23=83, p_24=89, p_25=97, p_26=101, p_27=103, p_28=107, p_29=109, p_30=113, p_31=127, p_32=131, p_33=137, p_34=139, p_35=149, p_36=151, p_37=157, p_38=163, p_39=167, p_40=173, p_41=179, p_42=181, p_43=191, p_44=193, p_45=197, p_46=199, p_47=211, p_48=223, p_49=227, p_50=229, p_51=233, p_52=239, p_53=241, etc.

So for n=9: d_9 is p_10 - p_9 = 29 - 23 = 6. Then d_10 is p_11 - p_10 = 31 - 29 = 2. Wait, so that would mean d_9 = 6, d_10 = 2. So they are not equal. But earlier I thought that d_9 and d_10 were both 6. That was a mistake. Wait, so where did I get that? Maybe I messed up the list of primes. Let me check again.

Wait, in my previous list, I had:

p_30 = 113, p_31 = 127, so d_30 = 14. Then p_31=127, p_32=131, so d_31=4. Then p_32=131, p_33=137, d_32=6. Then p_33=137, p_34=139, d_33=2. Then p_34=139, p_35=149, d_34=10. Then p_35=149, p_36=151, d_35=2. Then p_36=151, p_37=157, d_36=6. Then p_37=157, p_38=163, d_37=6. So here, d_36=6 and d_37=6. Therefore, that is n=36. But earlier, when I thought about n=9, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, so maybe I confused the indices. Let me check again. Let me list the gaps properly.

Original gaps:

n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,...

d_n: 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 6, 2, 4, 2, 12, 2, 4, 6, 2,...

Wait, here, for n=9, d_9=6, and d_10=6. But according to the primes list above, p_9=23, p_10=29, so d_9=6. Then p_10=29, p_11=31, so d_10=2. But according to this list, d_10=6. That's conflicting. So there's a mistake here. Where is the error?

Wait, maybe my initial list of primes was wrong. Let me check the primes again. Let me list them step by step:

p_1 = 2

p_2 = 3

p_3 = 5

p_4 = 7

p_5 = 11

p_6 = 13

p_7 = 17

p_8 = 19

p_9 = 23

p_10 = 29

p_11 = 31

p_12 = 37

p_13 = 41

p_14 = 43

p_15 = 47

p_16 = 53

p_17 = 59

p_18 = 61

p_19 = 67

p_20 = 71

p_21 = 73

p_22 = 79

p_23 = 83

p_24 = 89

p_25 = 97

p_26 = 101

p_27 = 103

p_28 = 107

p_29 = 109

p_30 = 113

p_31 = 127

p_32 = 131

p_33 = 137

p_34 = 139

p_35 = 149

p_36 = 151

p_37 = 157

p_38 = 163

p_39 = 167

p_40 = 173

p_41 = 179

p_42 = 181

p_43 = 191

p_44 = 193

p_45 = 197

p_46 = 199

p_47 = 211

So, according to this, p_10 is 29, p_11 is 31. Therefore, d_10 = 31 - 29 = 2. But earlier, when I listed the gaps, I had d_10=6. That was a mistake. So where did that come from? Probably I had a wrong list of primes. So the correct gaps are:

n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,...

d_n: 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 2, 12, 2, 4, 6, 2,...

Wait, so d_10 is 2, not 6. Therefore, my previous assumption that there was a case at n=9 was wrong. Then where did the 6,6 come from? Maybe in the later gaps. Let me check again.

Looking at the list of primes from p_30 onwards:

p_30 = 113, p_31 = 127, so d_30 = 14.

p_31 = 127, p_32 = 131, d_31 = 4.

p_32 = 131, p_33 = 137, d_32 = 6.

p_33 = 137, p_34 = 139, d_33 = 2.

p_34 = 139, p_35 = 149, d_34 = 10.

p_35 = 149, p_36 = 151, d_35 = 2.

p_36 = 151, p_37 = 157, d_36 = 6.

p_37 = 157, p_38 = 163, d_37 = 6.

So here, d_36=6 and d_37=6. Therefore, n=36 is a case where d_n = d_{n+1} = 6. Similarly, looking further:

p_38 = 163, p_39 = 167, d_38 = 4.

p_39 = 167, p_40 = 173, d_39 = 6.

p_40 = 173, p_41 = 179, d_40 = 6.

So here, d_39=6 and d_40=6. Therefore, n=39 is another case.

Then p_41 = 179, p_42 = 181, d_41 = 2.

p_42 = 181, p_43 = 191, d_42 = 10.

So no. Then p_43 = 191, p_44 = 193, d_43 = 2.

p_44 = 193, p_45 = 197, d_44 = 4.

p_45 = 197, p_46 = 199, d_45 = 2.

p_46 = 199, p_47 = 211, d_46 = 12.

p_47 = 211, p_48 = 223, d_47 = 12.

So here, d_46=12 and d_47=12. Therefore, n=46 is another case.

So that gives me three cases: n=2, n=36, n=39, n=46. Wait, but earlier I thought there was another case at n=9, but that was wrong. So where is the fourth case? Let me check again.

Looking back at the list of gaps:

Original gaps up to n=20:

d_1=1, d_2=2, d_3=2, d_4=4, d_5=2, d_6=4, d_7=2, d_8=4, d_9=6, d_10=2, d_11=4, d_12=6, d_13=2, d_14=4, d_15=2, d_16=12, d_17=2, d_18=4, d_19=6, d_20=2.

So looking for consecutive equal gaps here. The first case is n=2 (d_2=2, d_3=2). Then, looking further:

d_12=6, d_13=2. No. d_13=2, d_14=4. No. d_14=4, d_15=2. No. d_15=2, d_16=12. No. d_16=12, d_17=2. No. d_17=2, d_18=4. No. d_18=4, d_19=6. No. d_19=6, d_20=2. No. So after n=2, the next case is n=36, then n=39, then n=46. So that's three cases. But the problem asks for five. So I need to find two more.

Let me check further primes. Let me continue from p_47=211 onwards.

Looking for consecutive equal gaps here. Let's check:

Looking at d_55=6, d_56=6. So n=55: d_55=6, d_56=6. That's another case.

Then d_56=6, d_57=2. No.

d_57=2, d_58=6. No.

d_58=6, d_59=4. No.
