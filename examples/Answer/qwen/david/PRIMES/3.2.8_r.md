Okay, so I need to prove that there are infinitely many primes by assuming there are only finitely many, say p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ. The problem gives me this integer N which is the sum of products of all the primes except one each time. Let me try to understand what exactly N is.

First, let me write down N again:

N = p₂p₃…pₙ + p₁p₃…pₙ + … + p₁p₂…p_{n-1}

So, each term in the sum is the product of all the primes except one. For example, the first term is missing p₁, the second term is missing p₂, and so on, until the last term which is missing pₙ. So there are n terms in total, each term is the product of all primes except one. 

Now, the idea is that if we assume there are only finitely many primes, then N should be a number that is somehow related to these primes, but leads to a contradiction. Let me think about how this works.

First, let me note that each term in N is divisible by all primes except the one that's missing. For instance, the first term, which is p₂p₃…pₙ, is divisible by p₂, p₃, ..., pₙ. Similarly, the second term is divisible by p₁, p₃, ..., pₙ, and so on. 

So, if I take N, each term is divisible by a different prime. But how does that help? Maybe if I consider N modulo each prime?

Let me try that. Let's take a prime p_i, where i is between 1 and n. Let's compute N modulo p_i.

For each term in N, if the term is missing p_i, then that term is divisible by p_i. Wait, no. Wait, if a term is missing p_i, then that term is the product of all primes except p_i. Therefore, that term is divisible by p_i? No, wait. If you take the product of all primes except p_i, then that product is not divisible by p_i. Because p_i is not a factor of that product. So, for example, the first term is p₂p₃…pₙ, which is not divisible by p₁. But if I take N modulo p_i, then each term in N is either divisible by p_i or not?

Wait, let's think again. For each term in N, the term is the product of all primes except one. So, if I take a particular prime p_i, then in the term that is missing p_i, that term is the product of all primes except p_i. Therefore, that term is not divisible by p_i. However, in all the other terms, which are missing a different prime, each of those terms will include p_i as a factor. Therefore, when we take N modulo p_i, the term that is missing p_i will be congruent to something modulo p_i, and the other terms will be congruent to 0 modulo p_i.

Therefore, N modulo p_i is equal to the term that is missing p_i modulo p_i. Let me formalize this.

Let me denote the terms of N as T₁, T₂, ..., Tₙ, where T_k is the product of all primes except p_k. So, T₁ = p₂p₃...pₙ, T₂ = p₁p₃...pₙ, ..., Tₙ = p₁p₂...p_{n-1}.

Then, for each prime p_i, when we compute N modulo p_i, we have:

N ≡ T_i mod p_i, because all other terms T_j (j ≠ i) are divisible by p_i (since they include p_i as a factor), so they are congruent to 0 mod p_i. Therefore, N ≡ T_i mod p_i.

But T_i is the product of all primes except p_i. Therefore, T_i is equal to (product of all primes) divided by p_i. Let me denote P = p₁p₂...pₙ. Then T_i = P / p_i. Therefore, N ≡ P / p_i mod p_i.

But P is the product of all primes, so P is divisible by p_i. Therefore, P / p_i is an integer. However, let's compute P / p_i mod p_i. Since P = p₁p₂...pₙ, then P / p_i = (p₁...p_{i-1}p_{i+1}...pₙ). So, this is the product of all primes except p_i. However, when we take this product modulo p_i, since p_i is a prime, and all the other primes in the product are less than p_i or greater? Wait, no. Wait, the primes are ordered as p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ. But we don't know if they are in order. Wait, actually, in the standard proof, primes are usually listed in order, but here, the problem didn't specify. However, since we are assuming that p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ are all primes, but they could be in any order. However, in the standard proof, they are usually listed in ascending order, so p₁ is the smallest prime, p₂ next, etc.

But regardless of the order, when we take the product of all primes except p_i, and then take that modulo p_i, since p_i is one of the primes, and the other primes in the product are primes different from p_i. However, if we take the product of primes different from p_i modulo p_i, then since p_i is a prime, and none of the other primes are divisible by p_i (since they are distinct primes), so each of the other primes is coprime to p_i. Therefore, the product of all primes except p_i modulo p_i is equal to the product of (each prime except p_i) modulo p_i. However, since each of those primes is not divisible by p_i, their product modulo p_i is some integer between 1 and p_i - 1.

But wait, but here we have N ≡ T_i mod p_i, which is equal to P / p_i mod p_i. But P is the product of all primes, so P = p_i * (product of other primes). Therefore, P / p_i is the product of other primes. Therefore, N ≡ product of other primes mod p_i.

But here's the thing: since p_i is a prime, and the product of other primes is some integer. However, if we take that product modulo p_i, then since none of the other primes are divisible by p_i, the product is congruent to something not zero. Therefore, N ≡ something not zero mod p_i. Therefore, N is not divisible by p_i. 

But wait, but if N is not divisible by any of the primes p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ, then N must be either 1 or a product of primes not in the list. But since N is constructed as a sum of terms each of which is a product of primes, but N itself is a sum of these terms. However, if N is not divisible by any of the primes p₁,...,pₙ, then N must be either 1 or a product of primes not in the list. But since N is a sum of positive integers, it's definitely greater than 1. Therefore, N must be a product of primes not in the list, which would imply that there is a prime not in the original list, contradicting the assumption that there are only finitely many primes. Therefore, we have a contradiction, so our assumption is wrong, hence there are infinitely many primes.

Wait, but let me check this again. Let me take a concrete example. Let's say n=2, so primes p₁=2, p₂=3. Then N would be p₂ + p₁ = 3 + 2 = 5. Now, 5 is a prime not in the original list, so that works. If n=3, primes 2,3,5. Then N is p₂p₃ + p₁p₃ + p₁p₂. Let's compute that: 3*5 + 2*5 + 2*3 = 15 + 10 + 6 = 31. 31 is a prime not in the list. So that works. For n=4, primes 2,3,5,7. Then N is p₂p₃p₄ + p₁p₃p₄ + p₁p₂p₄ + p₁p₂p₃. Let's compute:

p₂p₃p₄ = 3*5*7 = 105

p₁p₃p₄ = 2*5*7 = 70

p₁p₂p₄ = 2*3*7 = 42

p₁p₂p₃ = 2*3*5 = 30

Adding them up: 105 + 70 = 175, 175 + 42 = 217, 217 + 30 = 247. Is 247 prime? Let me check. 247 divided by 13 is 19, because 13*19=247. So 247 is composite, but it's not in the original list of primes (2,3,5,7). So, 13 and 19 are primes not in the original list. Therefore, N is composite, but it's not divisible by any of the original primes. Therefore, N must have prime factors not in the original list. Hence, contradiction.

But in this case, N is composite, but it's not divisible by any of the original primes, so it must have prime factors outside the original list. Therefore, the assumption that there are only finitely many primes leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the conclusion is that there are infinitely many primes.

But let me check again. For n=3, N was 31, which is prime. For n=4, N was 247, which is composite but has prime factors not in the original list. So, regardless of whether N is prime or composite, it must have a prime factor not in the original list. Therefore, the key idea is that N is not divisible by any of the primes p₁,...,pₙ, so it must have a prime factor not in the list, which contradicts the assumption that the list is complete.

Therefore, the proof is by assuming that there are finitely many primes, constructing N as the sum of products of all primes except one, then showing that N is not divisible by any of the primes, hence must have a prime factor not in the list, leading to a contradiction.

But let me make sure that my reasoning is correct. Let me formalize it again.

Assume there are finitely many primes, p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ. Let N be the sum of the products of all primes except one. Then, for each prime p_i, N ≡ T_i mod p_i, where T_i is the product of all primes except p_i. But T_i is equal to (product of all primes) / p_i. However, since product of all primes is P = p₁p₂...pₙ, then T_i = P / p_i. Therefore, N ≡ P / p_i mod p_i. However, since P is divisible by p_i, P / p_i is an integer. But what is P / p_i mod p_i?

Let me compute P / p_i mod p_i. Since P = p_i * (product of other primes), then P / p_i is the product of other primes. Let me call this product Q_i. So Q_i = product of all primes except p_i. Now, Q_i mod p_i is equal to the product of all primes except p_i modulo p_i. However, since each of these primes is different from p_i, and p_i is prime, none of them are divisible by p_i. Therefore, each of these primes is invertible modulo p_i. Therefore, the product Q_i mod p_i is equal to the product of (each prime except p_i) mod p_i. However, since each prime is not divisible by p_i, their product mod p_i is not zero. Therefore, N ≡ Q_i mod p_i ≠ 0. Therefore, N is not divisible by p_i. 

Therefore, for each prime p_i in the original list, N is not divisible by p_i. Therefore, N must have a prime factor not in the original list, which contradicts the assumption that the original list contains all primes. Therefore, the assumption is false, so there are infinitely many primes.

Therefore, this seems to be a valid proof. But let me check if there is any possible mistake here.

Wait, but in the case where N is 1? For example, if N is 1, then it would not have any prime factors. But N is the sum of n terms, each of which is a product of n-1 primes. Each term is at least 2^{n-1} (if all primes are 2, but primes are distinct, so actually the terms are products of distinct primes, so each term is at least 2*3*...*p_{n-1}... but actually for n ≥ 2, the terms are at least 2*3... but even for n=2, the term is 3, and the other term is 2, so N is 5. So N is at least 5 for n=2, which is greater than 1. So N cannot be 1. Therefore, N is a number greater than 1, not divisible by any of the primes in the original list, so it must have a prime factor not in the original list. Therefore, contradiction.

Therefore, this seems correct. Therefore, this is another proof of the infinitude of primes.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to think about N. For example, maybe N is congruent to 1 mod p_i? Wait, no. Wait, in the case of n=2, N=5. Let's check modulo p₁=2. N=5 mod 2 is 1. Similarly, modulo p₂=3, N=5 mod 3 is 2. So in this case, N is not congruent to 0 mod any p_i, which is correct. For n=3, N=31. Let's check modulo 2: 31 mod 2 is 1. Modulo 3: 31 mod 3 is 1. Modulo 5: 31 mod 5 is 1. So N ≡ 1 mod each prime. Interesting. For n=4, N=247. Let's check modulo 2: 247 mod 2 is 1. Modulo 3: 247 / 3 is 82*3 + 1, so 247 mod 3 is 1. Modulo 5: 247 / 5 is 49*5 + 2, so 247 mod 5 is 2. Modulo 7: 247 / 7 is 35*7 + 2, so 247 mod 7 is 2. Wait, so in this case, N is not congruent to 1 mod all primes. So in the case of n=3, N was congruent to 1 mod all primes. For n=4, it's not. But in both cases, N is not congruent to 0 mod any prime. Therefore, regardless of the value, N is not divisible by any of the primes in the list. Therefore, the conclusion is that N must have a prime factor not in the list.

So, this seems to hold. Therefore, this is a valid proof. Therefore, the key idea is that N is constructed such that when you take it modulo any prime in the list, it is not congruent to 0, hence it cannot be divisible by any of them, hence must have a prime factor outside the list.

Therefore, the answer is that assuming there are finitely many primes leads to N being a number not divisible by any of them, hence must have a prime factor not in the list, contradiction.

But let me check another example. Let me take n=1. Wait, n=1 would be assuming only one prime, which is 2. Then N would be the sum of products of all primes except one. But since there is only one prime, p₁=2, then N would be the sum of products missing p₁, which is... there is only one term, which is the product of all primes except p₁, but there are no primes left. So the product is 1? Wait, maybe the definition of N for n=1 is 1? But in that case, N=1, which is not divisible by 2, but 1 is not a prime. However, the problem probably assumes n ≥ 2. But in any case, for n=1, the assumption is that there is only one prime, which is 2. Then N is 1, which is not divisible by 2, hence there is a prime not in the list, which is 1? But 1 is not a prime. So maybe n=1 is a special case. However, in the standard proof, n is at least 2. So maybe the problem assumes n ≥ 2.

Therefore, the reasoning holds for n ≥ 2.

Therefore, the conclusion is that N is not divisible by any of the primes in the list, hence must have a prime factor not in the list, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes.

Therefore, this is another proof of the infinitude of primes, using this specific construction of N.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\text{There are infinitely many primes.}}
</think>

To prove that there are infinitely many primes, we begin by assuming the opposite: that there are only finitely many primes, say $ p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n $. We are given a specific integer:

$$
N = p_2p_3 \cdots p_n + p_1p_3 \cdots p_n + \cdots + p_1p_2 \cdots p_{n-1}
$$

Each term in this sum is the product of all the primes except one. That is, the first term is the product of all primes except $ p_1 $, the second term is the product of all primes except $ p_2 $, and so on, up to the last term, which is the product of all primes except $ p_n $.

### Step 1: Analyze $ N \mod p_i $

Let’s consider the value of $ N \mod p_i $ for any prime $ p_i $ in the list $ \{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n\} $.

- The term corresponding to $ p_i $ is **not** divisible by $ p_i $, because it is the product of all primes **except** $ p_i $. So this term is **not congruent to 0 modulo $ p_i $**.
- However, all the other terms in the sum are **divisible by $ p_i $**, since each of those terms includes $ p_i $ as a factor.

Therefore, when we reduce $ N \mod p_i $, all terms except the one that is missing $ p_i $ vanish (i.e., are congruent to 0), and only the term missing $ p_i $ remains.

Let’s denote the term missing $ p_i $ as:

$$
T_i = \prod_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne i}}^n p_j
$$

So, we have:

$$
N \equiv T_i \mod p_i
$$

But $ T_i $ is the product of all the primes **except** $ p_i $, and since $ p_i $ is a prime and not a factor of $ T_i $, $ T_i \not\equiv 0 \mod p_i $. Therefore:

$$
N \not\equiv 0 \mod p_i
$$

This is true for **every** prime $ p_i $ in the list.

---

### Step 2: Conclude that $ N $ is not divisible by any of the primes

From the above, we have shown that $ N $ is **not divisible** by any of the primes $ p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n $. Therefore, $ N $ must be a number **greater than 1** that is **not divisible by any of the primes in the list**.

But this implies that $ N $ must have **some prime factor** that is **not in the original list**. This contradicts the assumption that the list contains **all** primes.

---

### Step 3: Contradiction and Conclusion

Hence, the assumption that there are **only finitely many primes** leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption must be false, and there must be **infinitely many primes**.

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{There are infinitely many primes.}}
