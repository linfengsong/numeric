Okay, so I need to prove that the Goldbach conjecture (that every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes) is equivalent to the statement that every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me recall what the Goldbach conjecture says. It states that any even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. For example, 4 = 2 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, 8 = 3 + 5, and so on. This is still unproven, but it's been verified for very large numbers.

Now, the other statement is that every integer greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes. Let me check some examples. For 6, which is even, but 6 is also the sum of 3 + 3, but since we need three primes, maybe 3 + 2 + 1? Wait, 1 isn't prime. So maybe 3 + 2 + 1 isn't valid. Wait, but 6 can be written as 3 + 2 + 1? No, because 1 isn't prime. Wait, maybe 3 + 2 + 1 is not allowed. So maybe for 6, we need three primes. Let me think. 3 + 2 + 1 is invalid. How about 2 + 2 + 2? That's 6, and 2 is prime. So yes, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. So that works. For 7, which is odd. 7 can be written as 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. For 8, which is even. If we use the Goldbach conjecture, 8 = 3 + 5, so then adding another 2? Wait, but the statement is that every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes. So for 8, maybe 3 + 3 + 2 = 8. Yes. Similarly, 9 can be 3 + 3 + 3, or 5 + 2 + 2. So that seems to work.

So the task is to show that these two statements are equivalent. That means if one is true, the other must be true, and vice versa.

So, first, maybe I need to show that if the Goldbach conjecture is true, then every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes. Then, also show that if every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes, then the Goldbach conjecture is true.

Let me start with the first direction: assuming Goldbach conjecture holds, then every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes.

So, take any integer n > 5. If n is even, then by Goldbach conjecture, n = p + q where p and q are primes. Then, can we write n as the sum of three primes? Well, if n is even, then n = p + q. If we take 2 as one of the primes, then n - 2 = p + q - 2. Wait, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, since n is even, we can write n as p + q, and then if we take 2 as another prime, but that would make n = p + q = 2 + (p + q - 2). Wait, but p + q - 2 is an integer. However, unless p + q - 2 is prime, that might not help. But maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, for even n, since n is even and greater than 2, Goldbach says n = p + q. Then, if we take 2 as a prime, then n = 2 + (p + q - 2). But p + q - 2 is n - 2, which is even minus 2, which is even. But n - 2 is even, so n - 2 is even. But n - 2 is equal to p + q - 2. However, unless p + q - 2 is prime, this might not help. Wait, but maybe we can take another prime. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, suppose n is even. Then, since n is even and greater than 2, Goldbach says n = p + q. Then, if we can write n as p + q + 0, but 0 isn't prime. So that doesn't help. Wait, but maybe if we take n = p + q, and then write it as p + q + 0? No, that's not helpful. Wait, but if we take 2 as one of the primes, then n = 2 + (n - 2). But n - 2 is even, and if n - 2 is greater than 2, then by Goldbach conjecture, n - 2 can be written as the sum of two primes. So n = 2 + (sum of two primes). Therefore, n is the sum of three primes: 2 + p + q. Therefore, if n is even and greater than 5, then n can be written as the sum of three primes. For example, take n = 8. Then 8 = 2 + 3 + 3. Similarly, n = 10 = 2 + 3 + 5. So that seems to work.

Now, what about odd integers? Let's take an odd integer n > 5. Since n is odd, it can be written as n = 2 + (n - 2). Now, n - 2 is odd minus 2, which is odd. Wait, n is odd, so n - 2 is odd. But if n - 2 is greater than 3 (since n > 5, then n - 2 > 3), so n - 2 is an odd integer greater than 3. Now, if we can write n - 2 as the sum of two primes, then n = 2 + (sum of two primes) = sum of three primes. But wait, n - 2 is odd. However, the Goldbach conjecture is about even numbers. So how do we write an odd number as the sum of two primes?

Wait, but there's another conjecture called the weak Goldbach conjecture, which states that every odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes. But that's actually proven now, but in this problem, we are supposed to show that the original Goldbach conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes. So maybe we need to use the Goldbach conjecture to show that.

But here, if n is odd and greater than 5, then n - 2 is odd and greater than 3. So, if we can write n - 2 as the sum of two primes, then n would be 2 + (sum of two primes), which is three primes. But how can we write n - 2 as the sum of two primes? Well, n - 2 is odd. The sum of two primes is even unless one of the primes is 2. So, if n - 2 is odd, then one of the primes must be 2, and the other is (n - 2) - 2 = n - 4. Therefore, if n - 4 is prime, then n - 2 = 2 + (n - 4). Therefore, n = 2 + 2 + (n - 4) = 2 + 2 + (n - 4). But n - 4 is prime. Therefore, n is the sum of three primes: 2, 2, and (n - 4). However, this requires that n - 4 is prime. But is that always true?

Wait, but if n is an odd integer greater than 5, then n - 4 is odd minus 4, which is odd minus even, so odd. For example, take n = 7. Then n - 4 = 3, which is prime. For n = 9, n - 4 = 5, which is prime. For n = 11, n - 4 = 7, prime. For n = 13, n - 4 = 9, which is not prime. Oh, so here n = 13. Then n - 4 = 9, which is not prime. Therefore, according to this approach, we can't write n - 2 as 2 + (n - 4), because n - 4 is not prime. Therefore, this approach would not work for n = 13. But n = 13 is an odd integer greater than 5, and according to the statement we need to prove, it should be expressible as the sum of three primes. Let's check. 13 can be written as 2 + 2 + 9, but 9 is not prime. 2 + 3 + 8, 8 is not prime. 2 + 5 + 6, 6 is not prime. 3 + 3 + 7 = 13. Yes, 3 + 3 + 7. So that works. So in this case, instead of using 2 + 2 + (n - 4), we can use 3 + 3 + 7. Therefore, maybe my previous approach is not sufficient because n - 4 may not be prime, but there is another way to write n - 2 as the sum of two primes.

But how can I ensure that? If I can write n - 2 as the sum of two primes, then n would be the sum of three primes. But how to write n - 2 as the sum of two primes? Since n - 2 is odd, one of the primes must be 2, so n - 2 = 2 + p, where p is a prime. Therefore, p = n - 4. But if p is not prime, then this approach fails. However, maybe there's another way to write n - 2 as the sum of two primes? For example, maybe not using 2? But since n - 2 is odd, the sum of two primes must be odd, which requires one prime to be even (i.e., 2) and the other to be odd. Therefore, the only way to write an odd number as the sum of two primes is 2 + p, where p is an odd prime. Therefore, if n - 2 is odd, then n - 2 = 2 + p, which implies p = n - 4. Therefore, if p is prime, then we can do that. But if p is not prime, then we cannot. Therefore, this approach only works if n - 4 is prime.

But in the case of n = 13, n - 4 = 9, which is not prime. However, n = 13 can be written as 3 + 3 + 7. So here, instead of using 2 + p, we use two odd primes. But how does that fit into the Goldbach conjecture? Wait, but the Goldbach conjecture is about even numbers. So maybe we need another approach.

Alternatively, maybe if we take n, which is odd, and write it as 2 + (n - 2). Then, since n - 2 is odd and greater than 3, we can write n - 2 as the sum of two primes? Wait, but n - 2 is odd, so as before, that would require 2 + p. But if p is not prime, then that doesn't help. However, maybe there's another way. Wait, but n - 2 is an odd number. So if we can write n - 2 as the sum of two primes, then n is the sum of three primes. But how?

Alternatively, maybe instead of using 2, we can use another prime. But since n - 2 is odd, the sum of two primes would have to be odd, so one prime is 2 and the other is odd. Therefore, if n - 2 is odd, then n - 2 = 2 + p, where p is prime. Therefore, if p is prime, then yes. But if p is not prime, then we cannot. Therefore, this seems to suggest that if n - 4 is prime, then n can be written as 2 + 2 + (n - 4). However, if n - 4 is not prime, then we need another way. But how?

But here's the thing: if we can write n - 2 as the sum of two primes, then n is the sum of three primes. However, since n - 2 is odd, the only way to write it as the sum of two primes is 2 + p. Therefore, if p is not prime, then we cannot. Therefore, this suggests that if n - 4 is not prime, then we cannot write n - 2 as the sum of two primes, but we need to write n as the sum of three primes. Therefore, perhaps we need to use another approach.

Wait, but maybe we can use the Goldbach conjecture in a different way. For example, take n, which is odd, and write n = 2 + m, where m is odd and greater than 3. Then, m is odd. If m is odd, then m can be written as the sum of two primes? Wait, but m is odd, so again, the same problem. However, if m is odd and greater than 5, then m can be written as the sum of three primes? Wait, but that's the statement we are trying to prove. So maybe this is circular.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the fact that if the Goldbach conjecture is true, then every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. So, if I take an odd number n > 5, then n - 3 is even and greater than 2 (since n > 5 implies n - 3 > 2). Therefore, by Goldbach conjecture, n - 3 = p + q, where p and q are primes. Therefore, n = 3 + p + q. Therefore, n is the sum of three primes: 3, p, q. Therefore, this would work. Wait, that seems promising.

Let me check with n = 13. Then n - 3 = 10, which is even. 10 can be written as 3 + 7 or 5 + 5. Therefore, 13 = 3 + 3 + 7 or 3 + 5 + 5. So that works. For n = 7, n - 3 = 4, which is 2 + 2. So 7 = 3 + 2 + 2. Yes. For n = 9, n - 3 = 6 = 3 + 3, so 9 = 3 + 3 + 3. For n = 11, n - 3 = 8 = 3 + 5, so 11 = 3 + 3 + 5. For n = 15, n - 3 = 12 = 5 + 7, so 15 = 3 + 5 + 7. So this seems to work.

Therefore, if n is an odd integer greater than 5, then n - 3 is even and greater than 2, so by Goldbach conjecture, n - 3 can be written as the sum of two primes. Therefore, n can be written as 3 + (sum of two primes), which is the sum of three primes. Therefore, this approach works. Therefore, if the Goldbach conjecture is true, then every integer greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes. Therefore, the first direction is proven.

Now, the other direction: if every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes, then the Goldbach conjecture is true. So, we need to show that if every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes, then every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.

So, take an even integer n > 2. We need to show that n can be written as the sum of two primes. Let's consider that n is even and greater than 2. Then, n can be written as the sum of three primes. Let me denote that n = p + q + r, where p, q, r are primes. Now, since n is even, the sum of three primes is even. The sum of three primes being even can happen in different ways. Since primes except 2 are odd, the sum of three primes:

- If all three primes are odd, then odd + odd + odd = odd + odd = even + odd = odd. So that's odd, which is not our case.

- If two primes are odd and one is 2, then odd + odd + 2 = even + 2 = even. So that's even.

- If one prime is odd and two are 2, then odd + 2 + 2 = odd + 4 = odd. Not even.

- If all three primes are 2, then 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which is even. But for n > 2, if n is even, say n = 4, then 2 + 2 + 0, but 0 is not prime. However, n = 4 can be written as 2 + 2, which is two primes. But in our case, we need to use the assumption that every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes. However, n = 4 is not greater than 5, so maybe the assumption is only for n > 5. Therefore, for n = 4, we can use the Goldbach conjecture directly, but for n > 5, we can use the other statement.

But in our case, we need to show that for any even n > 2, n can be written as the sum of two primes. So, let's take an even integer n ≥ 4. If n = 4, then 2 + 2. If n = 6, 3 + 3. For n ≥ 8, we can use the assumption that every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes. So, let's take n ≥ 8, even. Then, n can be written as the sum of three primes. Let me assume that n = p + q + r, where p, q, r are primes.

Now, since n is even, and the sum of three primes is even, as discussed earlier, there must be an even number of odd primes. Since primes are mostly odd, except 2, so the only way for the sum of three primes to be even is either:

- One of the primes is 2, and the other two are odd primes. Because 2 + odd + odd = even.

Or

- All three primes are 2. But that would only be possible for n = 6.

But for n ≥ 8, if n is even, then n can be written as 2 + p + q, where p and q are primes. Therefore, if we can show that p + q = n - 2, which is even. Since n - 2 is even and greater than or equal to 6 (since n ≥ 8). Therefore, by the Goldbach conjecture, n - 2 can be written as the sum of two primes. Wait, but that's circular, because we are trying to prove the Goldbach conjecture. However, in this case, we are assuming that every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes. So, if we can use that to show that n - 2 is the sum of two primes.

Wait, but n - 2 is even and greater than or equal to 6 (since n ≥ 8). Therefore, n - 2 is an even integer greater than or equal to 6. Therefore, according to the assumption, n - 2 can be written as the sum of three primes. However, how does that help us? If n - 2 is written as the sum of three primes, then n = 2 + (sum of three primes). But we need to write n as the sum of two primes. So, maybe we need to find a way to take one of the primes from the three-prime decomposition and adjust.

Alternatively, suppose that n is written as the sum of three primes: n = p + q + r. If one of the primes is 2, say p = 2, then n - 2 = q + r. Since n - 2 is even, and q + r is even, which means that q and r are both odd primes. Therefore, n = 2 + q + r, so n - 2 = q + r. Therefore, q + r is even, so q and r are both odd primes. Therefore, this shows that n can be written as the sum of two primes: 2 + (q + r). Wait, but no, that's not correct. Wait, n = 2 + q + r, so if we can write q + r as a single prime? No, that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no. Wait, if n is written as 2 + q + r, then that's three primes. But we need to write n as the sum of two primes. Therefore, if we have n = 2 + q + r, then we need to find two primes that add up to n. But how?

Alternatively, if n can be written as the sum of three primes, and if one of them is 2, then n - 2 is the sum of two primes. Therefore, if we can show that n - 2 can be written as the sum of two primes, then n can be written as 2 + (sum of two primes). Therefore, n is the sum of three primes, but we need to show that n is the sum of two primes. However, this seems to be going in circles.

Wait, but maybe if we can show that in any decomposition of n as the sum of three primes, at least one of the primes is 2. Then, n - 2 would be the sum of two primes, which would be the Goldbach conjecture. But is that true? That is, for any even n ≥ 8, can we write n as the sum of three primes where one of them is 2?

But how do we know that? Suppose that n is even and greater than or equal to 8. Then, according to the assumption, n can be written as the sum of three primes. However, maybe there's a decomposition where none of the primes is 2. For example, take n = 10. 10 can be written as 3 + 3 + 4, but 4 is not prime. Alternatively, 3 + 5 + 2. So that's 2 + 3 + 5. So that's one with 2. Alternatively, 5 + 5 + 0, but 0 isn't prime. So maybe all decompositions must include 2? Or maybe not?

Wait, take n = 12. 12 can be written as 5 + 5 + 2, or 7 + 5 + 0, but 0 isn't prime. Or 3 + 3 + 6, which is invalid. Or 3 + 5 + 4, invalid. So the only valid decomposition is 2 + 5 + 5, or 3 + 3 + 6 (invalid), or 2 + 3 + 7. So 2 + 3 + 7 = 12. Therefore, there is a decomposition with 2. But is there a decomposition without 2? Let's see. 12 = 3 + 3 + 6 (invalid), 3 + 5 + 4 (invalid), 5 + 5 + 2 (has 2). 7 + 5 + 0 (invalid). So maybe not. So for 12, all decompositions must include 2? Wait, but 12 can also be written as 3 + 3 + 6, but 6 isn't prime. So maybe not. Therefore, maybe for even numbers greater than or equal to 8, every decomposition into three primes must include 2? If that's the case, then n - 2 is the sum of two primes, which would be the Goldbach conjecture.

But how do I know that? Suppose that n is even and greater than or equal to 8, and that n can be written as the sum of three primes. If there exists a decomposition where none of the primes is 2, then that would mean that all three primes are odd. But the sum of three odd numbers is odd + odd + odd = odd + even = odd. But n is even, so this is impossible. Therefore, any decomposition of n into three primes must contain an even number of odd primes. Since n is even, the sum of three primes is even. Therefore, the number of odd primes in the decomposition must be even. Since there are three primes, the only way for the number of odd primes to be even is that there is 0 or 2 odd primes. But 0 odd primes would mean all three primes are 2, which would be 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. For n ≥ 8, that's not possible. Therefore, there must be exactly two odd primes and one even prime, which is 2. Therefore, every decomposition of n into three primes must include 2. Therefore, n = 2 + p + q, where p and q are odd primes. Therefore, n - 2 = p + q, which is the sum of two primes. Therefore, since n - 2 is even and greater than or equal to 6, by the assumption that every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes, but here we have that n - 2 is the sum of two primes. Therefore, this shows that n is the sum of two primes, which is the Goldbach conjecture.

Therefore, this completes the second direction. Therefore, if every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes, then every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.

Therefore, the two statements are equivalent.

But let me check with an example. Take n = 8. According to the assumption, 8 can be written as the sum of three primes. 3 + 3 + 2 = 8. Therefore, 8 - 2 = 6 = 3 + 3. Therefore, 6 is the sum of two primes, which is true. Therefore, 8 is the sum of two primes (3 + 5). Similarly, n = 10. 10 can be written as 2 + 3 + 5. Therefore, 10 - 2 = 8 = 3 + 5. Therefore, 8 is the sum of two primes. Therefore, 10 = 3 + 5 + 2. Wait, but 3 + 5 is 8, plus 2 is 10. So that works.

Another example: n = 12. 12 = 2 + 5 + 5. Therefore, 12 - 2 = 10 = 5 + 5. Therefore, 10 is the sum of two primes. Therefore, 12 = 5 + 5 + 2. Which is the sum of two primes (5 + 7, but 5 + 7 = 12? 5 + 7 is 12. Yes. So 12 can be written as 5 + 7, which is two primes.

Therefore, this seems to hold. Therefore, the two statements are equivalent.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the Goldbach conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\text{The Goldbach conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes.}}
</think>

To prove that the **Goldbach conjecture** (which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers) is **equivalent** to the statement that **every integer greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes**, we must establish a **two-way implication**.

---

### **1. Goldbach Conjecture ⇒ Every Integer > 5 is the Sum of Three Primes**

Assume the **Goldbach conjecture** is true: every even integer $ n > 2 $ can be written as the sum of two primes.

Let $ n > 5 $ be any integer.

- If $ n $ is **even**, then by the Goldbach conjecture, $ n = p + q $, where $ p, q $ are primes. We can then write $ n = 2 + p + q - 2 $, and since $ p + q - 2 $ is even and greater than 2, it can again be written as the sum of two primes. Thus, $ n = 2 + (p + q - 2) $, which is the sum of three primes.

- If $ n $ is **odd**, then $ n - 3 $ is even and greater than 2. By the Goldbach conjecture, $ n - 3 = p + q $, where $ p, q $ are primes. Therefore, $ n = 3 + p + q $, which is the sum of three primes.

Thus, **every integer $ n > 5 $** can be written as the sum of three primes.

---

### **2. Every Integer > 5 is the Sum of Three Primes ⇒ Goldbach Conjecture is True**

Assume that **every integer greater than 5** can be written as the sum of three primes.

Let $ n $ be an even integer greater than 2. Then, $ n $ can be written as the sum of three primes: $ n = a + b + c $, where $ a, b, c $ are primes.

Since $ n $ is even, the sum of three primes must be even. The only even prime is 2, so the sum must include 2 in such a way that the remaining two primes add up to an even number (since $ n - 2 $ is even).

Thus, we can write $ n = 2 + p + q $, where $ p + q = n - 2 $, and since $ n - 2 $ is even and greater than 2, it can be written as the sum of two primes by the assumption (that every number > 5 is the sum of three primes, and $ n - 2 \geq 4 $).

Therefore, $ n = 2 + p + q $, where $ p, q $ are primes, which is the **Goldbach conjecture**.

---

### **Conclusion**

We have shown that:

- If the **Goldbach conjecture** is true, then every integer greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes.
- Conversely, if every integer greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes, then the **Goldbach conjecture** is also true.

Thus, the two statements are logically **equivalent**.
