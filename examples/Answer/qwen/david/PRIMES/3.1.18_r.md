Okay, so I need to find 15 primes p such that when you add 50 to them, the result is also a prime number. Let me start by understanding the problem better.

First, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, I need to find primes p where p + 50 is also prime. Let me think about how to approach this.

Maybe I can start by checking small primes and see if adding 50 to them gives another prime. But I need to find 15 such primes, so maybe there's a pattern or some properties I can use to generate them more efficiently.

Let me recall that primes (except 2) are odd numbers. So, if p is an odd prime, then p + 50 would be odd + even = odd. So, p + 50 is also odd. However, if p is 2, then p + 50 is 52, which is even and greater than 2, so not prime. Therefore, p cannot be 2. So, all primes p we are looking for must be odd primes.

Therefore, p is an odd prime, so p is 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. Let me check some small primes:

Start with p = 3. Then p + 50 = 53. Is 53 prime? Yes, 53 is a prime number. So, 3 is one such prime.

Next, p = 7. 7 + 50 = 57. Is 57 prime? 57 divides by 3 (3*19=57), so no. Not prime.

p = 11. 11 + 50 = 61. 61 is prime. So, 11 is another one.

p = 13. 13 + 50 = 63. 63 is 7*9, not prime.

p = 17. 17 + 50 = 67. 67 is prime. So, 17 is good.

p = 19. 19 + 50 = 69. 69 is 3*23, not prime.

p = 23. 23 + 50 = 73. 73 is prime. So, 23 is another.

p = 29. 29 + 50 = 79. 79 is prime. So, 29 is good.

p = 31. 31 + 50 = 81. 81 is 9*9, not prime.

p = 37. 37 + 50 = 87. 87 is 3*29, not prime.

p = 41. 41 + 50 = 91. 91 is 7*13, not prime.

p = 43. 43 + 50 = 93. 93 is 3*31, not prime.

p = 47. 47 + 50 = 97. 97 is prime. So, 47 is good.

p = 53. 53 + 50 = 103. 103 is prime. So, 53 is another.

p = 59. 59 + 50 = 109. 109 is prime. So, 59 is good.

p = 61. 61 + 50 = 111. 111 is 3*37, not prime.

p = 67. 67 + 50 = 117. 117 is 3*39, not prime.

p = 71. 71 + 50 = 121. 121 is 11 squared, not prime.

p = 73. 73 + 50 = 123. 123 is 3*41, not prime.

p = 79. 79 + 50 = 129. 129 is 3*43, not prime.

p = 83. 83 + 50 = 133. 133 is 7*19, not prime.

p = 89. 89 + 50 = 139. 139 is prime. So, 89 is good.

p = 97. 97 + 50 = 147. 147 is 3*49, which is 3*7^2, not prime.

p = 101. 101 + 50 = 151. 151 is prime. So, 101 is good.

p = 103. 103 + 50 = 153. 153 is 9*17, not prime.

p = 107. 107 + 50 = 157. 157 is prime. So, 107 is good.

p = 109. 109 + 50 = 159. 159 is 3*53, not prime.

p = 113. 113 + 50 = 163. 163 is prime. So, 113 is good.

Okay, so let me list all the primes I found so far:

3, 11, 17, 23, 29, 47, 53, 59, 89, 101, 107, 113. Wait, that's 12 primes. I need 15. Let me check higher primes.

p = 127. 127 + 50 = 177. 177 is 3*59, not prime.

p = 131. 131 + 50 = 181. 181 is prime. So, 131 is good.

p = 137. 137 + 50 = 187. 187 is 11*17, not prime.

p = 139. 139 + 50 = 189. 189 is 3*63, not prime.

p = 149. 149 + 50 = 199. 199 is prime. So, 149 is good.

p = 151. 151 + 50 = 201. 201 is 3*67, not prime.

p = 157. 157 + 50 = 207. 207 is 3*69, not prime.

p = 163. 163 + 50 = 213. 213 is 3*71, not prime.

p = 167. 167 + 50 = 217. 217 is 7*31, not prime.

p = 173. 173 + 50 = 223. 223 is prime. So, 173 is good.

p = 179. 179 + 50 = 229. 229 is prime. So, 179 is good.

p = 181. 181 + 50 = 231. 231 is 3*77, not prime.

p = 191. 191 + 50 = 241. 241 is prime. So, 191 is good.

p = 193. 193 + 50 = 243. 243 is 3^5, not prime.

p = 197. 197 + 50 = 247. 247 is 13*19, not prime.

p = 199. 199 + 50 = 249. 249 is 3*83, not prime.

p = 211. 211 + 50 = 261. 261 is 3*87, not prime.

p = 223. 223 + 50 = 273. 273 is 3*91, not prime.

p = 227. 227 + 50 = 277. 277 is prime. So, 227 is good.

p = 229. 229 + 50 = 279. 279 is 3*93, not prime.

p = 233. 233 + 50 = 283. 283 is prime. So, 233 is good.

Okay, so let me collect all the primes I found up to here:

From earlier:

3, 11, 17, 23, 29, 47, 53, 59, 89, 101, 107, 113, 131, 149, 173, 179, 191, 227, 233. Wait, that's 19 primes. Let me check if I have 15.

Let me count:

1. 3

2. 11

3. 17

4. 23

5. 29

6. 47

7. 53

8. 59

9. 89

10. 101

11. 107

12. 113

13. 131

14. 149

15. 173

Okay, that's 15 primes. Let me verify each of them to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Check each p:

3: 3 + 50 = 53 (prime) ✔️

11: 11 + 50 = 61 (prime) ✔️

17: 17 + 50 = 67 (prime) ✔️

23: 23 + 50 = 73 (prime) ✔️

29: 29 + 50 = 79 (prime) ✔️

47: 47 + 50 = 97 (prime) ✔️

53: 53 + 50 = 103 (prime) ✔️

59: 59 + 50 = 109 (prime) ✔️

89: 89 + 50 = 139 (prime) ✔️

101: 101 + 50 = 151 (prime) ✔️

107: 107 + 50 = 157 (prime) ✔️

113: 113 + 50 = 163 (prime) ✔️

131: 131 + 50 = 181 (prime) ✔️

149: 149 + 50 = 199 (prime) ✔️

173: 173 + 50 = 223 (prime) ✔️

Okay, that's 15 primes. So, these are 15 primes p where p + 50 is also prime.

But wait, I need to make sure that there are no duplicates or mistakes in my list. Let me check if I missed any primes between, say, 3 and 173.

Wait, for example, when I checked p=7, p+50=57 not prime. p=13, 63 not prime. p=19, 69 not prime. p=23 is good. Then p=29, good. Then p=31, 81 not prime. p=37, 87 not prime. p=41, 91 not prime. p=43, 93 not prime. p=47, 97 prime. So that's correct.

Similarly, p=53, 103. p=59, 109. p=61, 111 not prime. p=67, 117 not prime. p=71, 121 not prime. p=73, 123 not prime. p=79, 129 not prime. p=83, 133 not prime. p=89, 139 prime. Then p=97, 147 not prime. p=101, 151 prime. p=103, 153 not prime. p=107, 157 prime. p=109, 159 not prime. p=113, 163 prime. Then p=127, 177 not prime. p=131, 181 prime. p=137, 187 not prime. p=139, 189 not prime. p=149, 199 prime. p=151, 201 not prime. p=157, 207 not prime. p=163, 213 not prime. p=167, 217 not prime. p=173, 223 prime. p=179, 229 prime. p=181, 231 not prime. p=191, 241 prime. p=193, 243 not prime. p=197, 247 not prime. p=199, 249 not prime. p=211, 261 not prime. p=223, 273 not prime. p=227, 277 prime. p=229, 279 not prime. p=233, 283 prime.

So, my list seems correct. So the 15 primes are:

3, 11, 17, 23, 29, 47, 53, 59, 89, 101, 107, 113, 131, 149, 173.

Wait, but when I listed them earlier, I had 15 primes. Let me check again:

1. 3

2. 11

3. 17

4. 23

5. 29

6. 47

7. 53

8. 59

9. 89

10. 101

11. 107

12. 113

13. 131

14. 149

15. 173

Yes, that's 15 primes. So, these are the primes p where p + 50 is also prime.

Alternatively, maybe there are other primes beyond 173 that I could have included, but since the question says "list 15", and I have 15, that's sufficient.

But just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other primes between, say, 173 and 191 that I might have missed. For example, p=179 is 179 + 50 = 229, which is prime. So that's another one. But in my list above, 179 is the 15th? Wait, no. Wait, in my list above, I had 15 primes up to 173. Then p=179 is another one. But in my count above, I had 15 primes. Let me check again.

Wait, when I listed up to 173, that was 15 primes. Then p=179 is another one. But if I need 15, maybe I can include 179 instead of 173? Wait, but in my initial count, I had 15 primes. Let me recount:

Original list:

1. 3

2. 11

3. 17

4. 23

5. 29

6. 47

7. 53

8. 59

9. 89

10. 101

11. 107

12. 113

13. 131

14. 149

15. 173

Yes, that's 15. But if I want to include 179, that would be the 16th. However, the problem says "list 15 of these primes", so 15 is okay. However, maybe I should check if there are more primes in between that I might have missed. For example, between 173 and 179, is there another prime p where p + 50 is prime?

p=179 is 179 + 50 = 229, which is prime. p=181: 181 + 50 = 231, not prime. p=191: 191 + 50 = 241, which is prime. So, 191 is another one. But if I need 15, then maybe I can include 179 and 191 instead of some others? But since I already have 15, maybe that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe there are more primes. Let me check p=193, 193 + 50 = 243, not prime. p=197, 247 not prime. p=199, 249 not prime. p=211, 261 not prime. p=223, 273 not prime. p=227, 277 prime. p=229, 279 not prime. p=233, 283 prime. So, if I include 227 and 233, that's two more. But if I have 15, maybe I can just pick the first 15.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to generate these primes. For example, considering that p and p + 50 are both primes. Since 50 is even, p must be odd (as we saw earlier). Also, considering modulo 3, 5, etc.

But maybe that's overcomplicating. Since I already have 15 primes, and they check out, perhaps that's sufficient.

But just to be sure, let me check if there are any other primes between 3 and 173 that I might have missed. For example, p=7: 7+50=57 not prime. p=13: 63 not prime. p=19: 69 not prime. p=23: 73 prime. p=29: 79 prime. p=31: 81 not prime. p=37: 87 not prime. p=41: 91 not prime. p=43: 93 not prime. p=47: 97 prime. p=53: 103 prime. p=59: 109 prime. p=61: 111 not prime. p=67: 117 not prime. p=71: 121 not prime. p=73: 123 not prime. p=79: 129 not prime. p=83: 133 not prime. p=89: 139 prime. p=97: 147 not prime. p=101: 151 prime. p=103: 153 not prime. p=107: 157 prime. p=109: 159 not prime. p=113: 163 prime. p=127: 177 not prime. p=131: 181 prime. p=137: 187 not prime. p=139: 189 not prime. p=149: 199 prime. p=151: 201 not prime. p=157: 207 not prime. p=163: 213 not prime. p=167: 217 not prime. p=173: 223 prime.

So, all the primes between 3 and 173 that satisfy the condition are as listed. So, the first 15 are as above.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to generate them more systematically. For example, considering that p + 50 is prime, so p must be such that p is not congruent to certain residues modulo small primes. For example, if we consider modulo 3: primes (other than 3) are congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3. Then p + 50 ≡ p + 50 mod 3. Since 50 ≡ 2 mod 3, so p + 50 ≡ p + 2 mod 3. For p + 50 to be prime, it can't be divisible by 3. So, if p ≡ 1 mod 3, then p + 50 ≡ 1 + 2 = 0 mod 3. Therefore, p cannot be 1 mod 3, because then p + 50 would be divisible by 3. Similarly, if p ≡ 2 mod 3, then p + 50 ≡ 2 + 2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3, which is okay. Therefore, p cannot be 1 mod 3. Therefore, p must be 2 mod 3. However, p is a prime, so p can be 2 or 3. But 3 is 0 mod 3. However, if p is 3, then p + 50 = 53, which is prime. So, 3 is allowed. However, for other primes, they must be 2 mod 3. Therefore, primes p ≡ 2 mod 3. Therefore, when looking for primes p, we can restrict ourselves to primes that are 2 mod 3, except for p=3.

This could help in generating candidates. For example, primes p ≡ 2 mod 3. Let me check if that's the case for the primes I found.

Take p=3: 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. But p + 50 is 53, which is prime. So, that's an exception.

For p=11: 11 mod 3 is 2. Yes. 11 + 50 = 61, which is prime.

p=17: 17 mod 3 is 2. 17 + 50 = 67, prime.

p=23: 23 mod 3 is 2. 23 + 50 = 73, prime.

p=29: 29 mod 3 is 2. 29 + 50 = 79, prime.

p=47: 47 mod 3 is 2. 47 + 50 = 97, prime.

p=53: 53 mod 3 is 2. 53 + 50 = 103, prime.

p=59: 59 mod 3 is 2. 59 + 50 = 109, prime.

p=89: 89 mod 3 is 2. 89 + 50 = 139, prime.

p=101: 101 mod 3 is 2. 101 + 50 = 151, prime.

p=107: 107 mod 3 is 2. 107 + 50 = 157, prime.

p=113: 113 mod 3 is 2. 113 + 50 = 163, prime.

p=131: 131 mod 3 is 2. 131 + 50 = 181, prime.

p=149: 149 mod 3 is 2. 149 + 50 = 199, prime.

p=173: 173 mod 3 is 2. 173 + 50 = 223, prime.

So, all the primes except p=3 are congruent to 2 mod 3. Therefore, this is a useful filter. Therefore, when generating primes p, we can look for primes ≡ 2 mod 3 (except p=3). This reduces the number of candidates we need to check.

Similarly, maybe considering modulo 5. Let's see. For p + 50 to be prime, p + 50 cannot be divisible by 5. Since 50 is divisible by 5, so p + 50 ≡ p mod 5. Therefore, p cannot be 0 mod 5. Therefore, p cannot be 5. But p=5: 5 + 50 = 55, which is 5*11, not prime. Therefore, p cannot be 5. Therefore, primes p must not be 5. However, p=5 is excluded. Therefore, for primes p ≠ 5, they must not be 0 mod 5. So, primes p ≡ 1, 2, 3, or 4 mod 5. But since p is prime, it can't be 0 mod 5, except for p=5 itself.

Therefore, combining these conditions, we can generate primes p that are not 5, not 0 mod 3 (except p=3), and so on. However, this is getting more complex, but maybe helpful for generating candidates.

But since I already have 15 primes, and they check out, maybe that's sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe I can check if there are more primes in the list. For example, p=199: 199 + 50 = 249, which is not prime. p=211: 261 not prime. p=223: 273 not prime. p=227: 277 prime. p=229: 279 not prime. p=233: 283 prime. So, these are two more primes. If I need 15, maybe I can include these as well.

But the problem says "list 15 of these primes", so as long as I have 15, it's okay. However, maybe the user expects the first 15, which I have. But to be safe, let me check if my list is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can check some of the primes again. For example, p=173: 173 + 50 = 223. 223 is a prime. Yes. p=131: 131 + 50 = 181. 181 is prime. Yes. p=149: 199 is prime. Yes. p=107: 157 is prime. Yes. p=113: 163 is prime. Yes. p=101: 151 is prime. Yes. p=89: 139 is prime. Yes. p=59: 109 is prime. Yes. p=53: 103 is prime. Yes. p=47: 97 is prime. Yes. p=29: 79 is prime. Yes. p=23: 73 is prime. Yes. p=17: 67 is prime. Yes. p=11: 61 is prime. Yes. p=3: 53 is prime. Yes.

Therefore, all of these are correct. Therefore, the list is correct.

Therefore, the answer is these 15 primes: 3, 11, 17, 23, 29, 47, 53, 59, 89, 101, 107, 113, 131, 149, 173.

But just to make sure, let me check if there are any other primes between 3 and 173 that I might have missed. For example, p=7: 57 not prime. p=13: 63 not prime. p=19: 69 not prime. p=23: yes. p=29: yes. p=31: 81 not prime. p=37: 87 not prime. p=41: 91 not prime. p=43: 93 not prime. p=47: yes. p=53: yes. p=59: yes. p=61: 111 not prime. p=67: 117 not prime. p=71: 121 not prime. p=73: 123 not prime. p=79: 129 not prime. p=83: 133 not prime. p=89: yes. p=97: 147 not prime. p=101: yes. p=103: 153 not prime. p=107: yes. p=109: 159 not prime. p=113: yes. p=127: 177 not prime. p=131: yes. p=137: 187 not prime. p=139: 189 not prime. p=149: yes. p=151: 201 not prime. p=157: 207 not prime. p=163: 213 not prime. p=167: 217 not prime. p=173: yes. So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is these 15 primes.

**Final Answer**
The 15 primes are \boxed{3}, \boxed{11}, \boxed{17}, \boxed{23}, \boxed{29}, \boxed{47}, \boxed{53}, \boxed{59}, \boxed{89}, \boxed{101}, \boxed{107}, \boxed{113}, \boxed{131}, \boxed{149}, and \boxed{173}.

To solve the problem of finding 15 primes $ p $ such that $ p + 50 $ is also prime, we follow a systematic approach:

---

### **Understanding the Problem**

We are looking for primes $ p $ such that both $ p $ and $ p + 50 $ are prime numbers. This means that for each candidate $ p $, we must check whether $ p $ is prime and whether $ p + 50 $ is also prime.

---

### **Strategy**

- Start with small primes and incrementally test them.
- For each prime $ p $, compute $ p + 50 $ and check if it is also a prime.
- Continue until we find 15 such primes.

---

### **Key Observations**

- All primes (except 2) are odd, and adding 50 (an even number) to an odd number results in an odd number, which is a candidate for being prime.
- The number 2 is excluded because $ 2 + 50 = 52 $, which is not prime.
- The prime $ p = 3 $ is valid since $ 3 + 50 = 53 $, which is also prime.

---

### **Finding the First 15 Valid Primes**

By iterating through primes and checking the condition $ p + 50 $ is also prime, we find the following 15 primes:

1. $ p = 3 $ → $ 3 + 50 = 53 $ (prime)
2. $ p = 11 $ → $ 11 + 50 = 61 $ (prime)
3. $ p = 17 $ → $ 17 + 50 = 67 $ (prime)
4. $ p = 23 $ → $ 23 + 50 = 73 $ (prime)
5. $ p = 29 $ → $ 29 + 50 = 79 $ (prime)
6. $ p = 47 $ → $ 47 + 50 = 97 $ (prime)
7. $ p = 53 $ → $ 53 + 50 = 103 $ (prime)
8. $ p = 59 $ → $ 59 + 50 = 109 $ (prime)
9. $ p = 89 $ → $ 89 + 50 = 139 $ (prime)
10. $ p = 101 $ → $ 101 + 50 = 151 $ (prime)
11. $ p = 107 $ → $ 107 + 50 = 157 $ (prime)
12. $ p = 113 $ → $ 113 + 50 = 163 $ (prime)
13. $ p = 131 $ → $ 131 + 50 = 181 $ (prime)
14. $ p = 149 $ → $ 149 + 50 = 199 $ (prime)
15. $ p = 173 $ → $ 173 + 50 = 223 $ (prime)

All of these values satisfy the condition that both $ p $ and $ p + 50 $ are primes.
