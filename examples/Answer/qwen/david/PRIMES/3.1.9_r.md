Okay, so I need to solve these two problems about primes that are 1 more than a power of 2 and primes of the form n² + 1. Let me start with part (a). 

First, the question is asking for two more primes that are 1 more than a power of 2. They gave an example: 5 = 2² + 1. So, I need to find two more primes like that. Let me recall that numbers of the form 2^k + 1 are called Fermat numbers, right? And Fermat primes are those that are prime. So, the known Fermat primes are for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Wait, let me check that. 

Fermat numbers are defined as F_n = 2^(2^n) + 1. The first few are:

F₀ = 3 (2^1 + 1)
F₁ = 5 (2^2 + 1)
F₂ = 17 (2^4 + 1)
F₃ = 257 (2^8 + 1)
F₄ = 65537 (2^16 + 1)

And then F₅ is 4294967297, which is not prime, as it factors into 641 × 6700417. So, only the first five Fermat numbers are known to be prime. But the question here is about numbers that are 1 more than a power of 2, not necessarily a power of 2 with an exponent that's a power of 2. Wait, so maybe they are referring to numbers of the form 2^k + 1 where k is any integer, not necessarily a power of 2. 

But in the example given, 5 is 2² + 1, which is a Fermat number. However, there might be other primes of the form 2^k + 1 where k is not a power of 2. For example, if k is 3, then 2^3 + 1 = 9, which is not prime. If k is 4, 2^4 + 1 = 17, which is prime. If k is 5, 2^5 + 1 = 33, not prime. k=6: 65, not prime. k=7: 129, not prime. k=8: 257, which is prime. k=9: 513, not prime. k=10: 1025, which is 5×205, not prime. 

So maybe the only primes of the form 2^k + 1 are the Fermat primes? So, if that's the case, then the known primes are 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537. But the question says "two more of these primes", and the example is 5. So maybe they are looking for 17 and 257? But 3 is also such a prime. Wait, 3 is 2^1 + 1. But the example given is 5, which is 2² + 1. So maybe they want primes where the exponent is greater than 1? Or maybe not. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is not restricting to Fermat numbers. Let me check for other exponents. For example, if k is 0, 2^0 + 1 = 2, which is prime, but maybe they are considering exponents starting from 1? But 2 is a prime, but 2 is 2^1 + 1? Wait, no. 2^1 is 2, so 2^1 + 1 is 3. So 3 is 2^1 + 1. So maybe the question is looking for primes of the form 2^k + 1, where k is a positive integer. Then, the primes would be 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537. So if the example is 5, then the two more would be 17 and 257. 

But let me check if there are any other primes of the form 2^k + 1. For example, if k is 2, 2^2 +1=5. k=4: 17, k=8:257, k=16: 65537. Then k=32: 2^32 +1. Is that prime? I think that's not known, but it's not proven to be composite. However, in the context of this problem, maybe they just want the known ones. 

So, if the question is asking for two more primes besides 5, then 17 and 257 would be the answer. Let me check if 17 is indeed 2^4 + 1. Yes, 2^4 is 16, plus 1 is 17. And 257 is 2^8 +1. So those are two more primes. 

But maybe there are other exponents? For example, 2^k +1 where k is not a power of 2. Wait, but if k is not a power of 2, then 2^k +1 might not be prime. For example, k=6: 2^6 +1 = 65, which is 5×13. k=5: 33, not prime. k=7: 129, which is 3×43. So, seems like only when k is a power of 2, we get primes. Therefore, the known primes are those Fermat primes. Therefore, the answer would be 17 and 257. 

So part (a) answer is 17 and 257. Let me check if they are primes. 17 is prime, 257 is prime, 65537 is prime. So yes. 

Now moving on to part (b). The question is about primes of the form n² +1. They gave an example: 257 = 16² +1. So, need to find five more primes of this form. 

So, primes that are one more than a square. So, for example, 2 = 1² +1, but 2 is prime. 5 = 2² +1, which is prime. 17 = 4² +1, 257 = 16² +1. Then, maybe other numbers. 

So, the task is to find five more primes of the form n² +1. Let me think. 

First, let me note that n² +1 is prime. So, for n=0, 0² +1=1, not prime. n=1: 1 +1=2, prime. n=2: 4 +1=5, prime. n=3: 9 +1=10, not prime. n=4: 16 +1=17, prime. n=5: 25 +1=26, not prime. n=6: 36 +1=37, prime. n=7: 49 +1=50, not prime. n=8: 64 +1=65, not prime. n=9: 81 +1=82, not prime. n=10: 100 +1=101, prime. 

So, so far, for n=1,2,4,6,10, we have primes. So that's five primes. But the example given is 257 = 16² +1. So maybe they want more examples. Let me check n=12: 144 +1=145, which is 5×29, not prime. n=11: 121 +1=122, not prime. n=13: 169 +1=170, not prime. n=14: 196 +1=197, prime. So 197 is another one. 

n=15: 225 +1=226, not prime. n=16: 256 +1=257, which is the example. n=17: 289 +1=290, not prime. n=18: 324 +1=325, not prime. n=19: 361 +1=362, not prime. n=20: 400 +1=401, prime. 

So, so far, the primes are:

n=1: 2

n=2: 5

n=4: 17

n=6: 37

n=10: 101

n=14: 197

n=20: 401

n=24: 24² +1=576 +1=577, which is prime?

Wait, let me check 577. Hmm, 577 divided by primes up to sqrt(577) which is about 24. So check divisibility by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. 

577 is odd, not divisible by 2. 5+7+7=19, not divisible by 3. Doesn't end with 5 or 0, so not divisible by 5. 577 divided by 7: 7*82=574, 577-574=3, so no. 11: 11*52=572, 577-572=5, not divisible. 13: 13*44=572, 577-572=5, nope. 17: 17*33=561, 17*34=578, which is over. So no. 19: 19*30=570, 577-570=7, not divisible. 23: 23*25=575, 577-575=2, nope. So 577 is prime. 

So n=24 gives 577. 

So, so the primes are 2,5,17,37,101,197,401,577,... 

So the example given is 257=16² +1. So the question is to exhibit five more primes of this type. The example is 257, so maybe they want five more besides that? Wait, the problem says "for example, 257 = 16² + 1. Exhibit five more primes of this type." So, the example is 257, so we need to find five more primes of the form n² +1. So, in addition to 257, find five more. 

So, let's see. Let me list the primes we have:

From above:

n=1: 2

n=2:5

n=4:17

n=6:37

n=10:101

n=14:197

n=16:257

n=20:401

n=24:577

n=... maybe n=26: 26² +1=676 +1=677. Is 677 prime? Let's check. Divided by 2, no. 3: 6+7+7=20, not divisible by 3. 5: ends with 7, no. 7: 7*96=672, 677-672=5, nope. 11: 11*61=671, 677-671=6, nope. 13: 13*52=676, 677-676=1, nope. 17: 17*39=663, 17*40=680, too big. So 677 is prime. 

So n=26: 677.

Similarly, n=30: 30² +1=900 +1=901. Is that prime? Let's check. 901 divided by 17: 17*53=901? 17*50=850, 17*53=850 + 51=901. Yes. So 901=17×53, not prime.

n=34: 34² +1=1156 +1=1157. Check if prime. Divided by 13: 13*89=1157? 13*90=1170, so 13*89=1157. Yes, so 13×89=1157, not prime.

n=36: 36² +1=1296 +1=1297. Check if prime. Let me check divisibility. Divided by 2, no. 3: 1+2+9+7=19, not divisible by 3. 5: ends with 7. 7: 7*185=1295, 1297-1295=2, not divisible. 11: 1 - 2 + 9 - 7 = 1 -2= -1 +9=8 -7=1, not divisible by 11. 13: 13*99=1287, 1297-1287=10, not divisible. 17: 17*76=1292, 1297-1292=5, nope. 19: 19*68=1292, same as above. 23: 23*56=1288, 1297-1288=9, nope. 29: 29*44=1276, 29*45=1305, which is over. So 1297 is prime. 

So n=36: 1297. 

So, compiling the list:

n=1: 2

n=2:5

n=4:17

n=6:37

n=10:101

n=14:197

n=16:257

n=20:401

n=24:577

n=26:677

n=36:1297

So, if the example is 257, which is n=16, then five more primes would be, for example, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197, 257, 401, etc. But the problem says "exhibit five more primes of this type", so the example is 257, so need five more. So, for example, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. But maybe the question wants five primes other than the example. Wait, the example is 257. So maybe the five more are 5, 17, 37, 101, 197? Or maybe including others. 

But let me check. The problem says "for example, 257 = 16² + 1. Exhibit five more primes of this type." So the example is 257, so the five more would be five primes of the form n² +1, different from 257. So, for example, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. But maybe the problem wants five more, so maybe 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. But let me check if these are primes. 

Yes, 5 is prime, 17 is prime, 37 is prime, 101 is prime, 197 is prime. So that's five. Alternatively, maybe 2, 5, 17, 37, 101, but 2 is also a prime of that form. However, the example is 257, so maybe they want five primes other than the example. But the problem doesn't specify that they have to be different from the example, just to exhibit five more. So maybe including 2 is okay. 

But let me check the problem statement again. It says "for example, 257 = 16² + 1. Exhibit five more primes of this type." So, the example is one, and we need five more. So, five more primes, so total six. But maybe the question is just to find five primes of the form n² +1, with 257 being an example. 

But maybe the question is expecting more numbers. Let me check if there are more primes. For example, n=2, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197, 257, 401, 577, 677, 1297, etc. So if the example is 257, then five more could be 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. Alternatively, maybe 2, 5, 17, 37, 101. But maybe the problem wants five primes that are not the example. 

Alternatively, maybe they want five primes other than the example. But the problem doesn't specify. However, since 257 is given as an example, perhaps the answer is to give five primes of the form n² +1, so maybe including 2, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197, etc. But since the example is 257, maybe the five more are 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants five primes in addition to the example. So, for example, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting larger numbers. For example, 401, 577, 677, 1297, etc. 

But since the problem says "exhibit five more primes of this type", and the example is 257, so maybe they want five primes other than 257. Let me check if 2 is considered. If n=1, 1² +1=2. So 2 is a prime. So maybe the answer is 2, 5, 17, 37, 101. But the example is 257. So maybe the five more are 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting numbers with larger n. But I need to check if the question is from a textbook or something. But since I don't have that context, I need to make an educated guess. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. Let me check if these are primes. 

5 is prime. 17 is prime. 37 is prime. 101 is prime. 197 is prime. Yes. So that's five primes. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 5, 17, 37, 101, 257. But 257 is the example. So the problem says "exhibit five more primes of this type", so the example is one, so five more. Therefore, five primes different from the example. So maybe 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, the problem might accept 2, 5, 17, 37, 101. But since 2 is a prime, but maybe the problem is expecting numbers where n is greater than 1? Not sure. 

But since the example is 257, which is 16² +1, and the question is to exhibit five more, maybe they want five primes where n is larger than 1. 

But in any case, I can list five primes of the form n² +1. For example, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, let me check if there are other primes. For example, n=12: 145, not prime. n=18: 325, not prime. n=22: 484 +1=485, which is 5×97, not prime. n=28: 784 +1=785, which is 5×157, not prime. n=30: 901, not prime. n=32: 1024 +1=1025, which is 5×205, not prime. n=34: 1156 +1=1157, which is 13×89, not prime. n=38: 1444 +1=1445, which is 5×289, not prime. n=40: 1600 +1=1601. Is that prime? Let me check. 

1601. Divided by 2: no. 3: 1+6+0+1=8, not divisible by 3. 5: ends with 1. 7: 7*228=1596, 1601-1596=5, not divisible. 11: 1 - 6 + 0 - 1 = -6, not divisible. 13: 13*123=1599, 1601-1599=2, not divisible. 17: 17*94=1598, 1601-1598=3, nope. 19: 19*84=1596, 1601-1596=5, nope. 23: 23*69=1587, 23*70=1610, which is over. So 1601 is prime. So n=40: 1601. 

So, that's another one. 

So, if I need five more primes, maybe 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, maybe 5, 17, 37, 101, 1601. But that might be too big. 

But the problem says "exhibit five more primes of this type", so maybe they just need five primes, regardless of size. So, for example, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting more numbers. Let me check the list again. 

So, the primes of the form n² +1 are:

n=1: 2

n=2:5

n=4:17

n=6:37

n=10:101

n=14:197

n=16:257

n=20:401

n=24:577

n=26:677

n=36:1297

n=40:1601

So, if the example is 257, then five more could be 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, maybe 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, if the problem is expecting five primes beyond the example, then maybe 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, maybe 5, 17, 37, 101, 257. But 257 is the example. 

But the problem says "exhibit five more primes of this type", so five primes in addition to the example. So the example is 257, so five more. Therefore, the answer would be five primes different from 257. 

So, for example, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, if the problem allows 2, then maybe 2, 5, 17, 37, 101. 

But I think the problem is expecting numbers where n is greater than 1, but not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting primes that are not the example. Since the example is 257, which is 16² +1, then five more could be 5 (2² +1), 17 (4² +1), 37 (6² +1), 101 (10² +1), 197 (14² +1). 

Yes, that's five. 

Therefore, for part (b), the answer is 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

But let me check if these are primes. 

5 is prime. 17 is prime. 37 is prime. 101 is prime. 197 is prime. Yes. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants five primes other than the example and 2. But since the example is 257, which is 16² +1, and the question says "exhibit five more primes of this type", so five more, so five different from 257. 

So, the answer for part (b) is five primes: 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants them in order. Let me check if there are other primes. For example, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, 5, 17, 37, 101, 257. But 257 is the example. 

So, I think the answer is 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

But let me check if there's another way. For example, if I take n=0, 0² +1=1, not prime. n=1: 2, prime. n=2:5. So, if the problem is okay with 2, then maybe 2, 5, 17, 37, 101. 

But since the example is 257, which is for n=16, maybe the problem is expecting numbers with n larger than 2. But since the problem didn't specify, maybe both are acceptable. However, since the example is 257, which is for n=16, and the question is to exhibit five more, maybe they want five primes that are not the example. So 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting more numbers. For example, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197, 257, 401, etc. But the question says "five more", so five. 

Therefore, I think that part (a) answer is 17 and 257, and part (b) answer is 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

But let me check if there are any other primes that I might have missed. For example, n=12: 145, not prime. n=18: 325, not. n=22: 485, not. n=28: 785, not. n=30: 901, not. n=32: 1025, not. n=34: 1157, not. n=38: 1445, not. n=42: 1764 +1=1765, which is 5×353, not prime. n=44: 1936 +1=1937. Is that prime? Let me check. Divided by 13: 13×149=1937? 13×150=1950, so 1950 -13=1937. Yes, so 13×149=1937, not prime. 

So, n=46: 46² +1=2116 +1=2117. Divided by 7: 7×302=2114, 2117-2114=3, not divisible. Divided by 13: 13×162=2106, 2117-2106=11, not divisible. 17: 17×124=2108, 2117-2108=9, nope. 19: 19×111=2109, 2117-2109=8, nope. 23: 23×92=2116, 2117-2116=1, nope. So 2117 is prime? Wait, 2117. Let me check again. 2117 divided by 29: 29×73=2117? 29×70=2030, 29×73=2030 + 29×3=2030 + 87=2117. Yes! So 29×73=2117. Therefore, not prime. 

So, n=46: not prime. 

So, n=48: 2304 +1=2305. Divided by 5: ends with 5, so 5×461=2305. Not prime. 

n=50: 2500 +1=2501. Divided by 13: 13×192=2496, 2501-2496=5, nope. Divided by 7: 7×357=2499, 2501-2499=2, nope. Divided by 17: 17×147=2499, same as above. 19×131=2489, 2501-2489=12, nope. 23×108=2484, 2501-2484=17, nope. Maybe 2501 is prime? Wait, 2501. Let me check sqrt(2501) is about 50. So check primes up to 50. Divided by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47. 

2501 divided by 2: no. 3: 2+5+0+1=8, not divisible. 5: ends with 1. 7: 7×357=2499, 2501-2499=2. 11: 2 - 5 + 0 - 1 = -4, not divisible. 13: 13×192=2496, 2501-2496=5. 17: 17×147=2499, 2501-2499=2. 19: 19×131=2489, 2501-2489=12. 23: 23×108=2484, 2501-2484=17. 29: 29×86=2494, 2501-2494=7. 31: 31×80=2480, 2501-2480=21, not divisible. 37: 37×67=2479, 2501-2479=22, not divisible. 41: 41×61=2501? 41×60=2460, 41×61=2460 +41=2501. Yes! So 41×61=2501. Therefore, not prime. 

So, n=50: not prime. 

So, seems like the primes are as I listed before. Therefore, the five more primes are 5, 17, 37, 101, 197. 

Therefore, I think that's the answer. 

So, summarizing:

(a) Two more primes that are 1 more than a power of 2: 17 and 257.

(b) Five more primes of the form n² +1: 5, 17, 37, 101, 197.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{17} and \boxed{257}

(b) \boxed{5}, \boxed{17}, \boxed{37}, \boxed{101}, and \boxed{197}
</think>

To solve the two parts of the question, we approach each by identifying primes that match the given forms.

### **Part (a)**

We are asked to find **two more primes** that are **1 more than a power of 2**, like the example given:  
$$
5 = 2^2 + 1
$$

This is a classic form known as a **Fermat prime**. A Fermat number is of the form:

$$
F_k = 2^{2^k} + 1
$$

The known Fermat primes are:

- $ F_0 = 2^{2^0} + 1 = 3 $
- $ F_1 = 2^{2^1} + 1 = 5 $
- $ F_2 = 2^{2^2} + 1 = 17 $
- $ F_3 = 2^{2^3} + 1 = 257 $
- $ F_4 = 2^{2^4} + 1 = 65537 $

These are the only known Fermat primes, and it is conjectured that no more exist. However, the problem only asks for **two more** primes of the form $ 2^k + 1 $, not necessarily Fermat primes. So, we look for numbers of the form $ 2^k + 1 $ that are prime.

From known results:

- $ 2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 $, which is prime.
- $ 2^8 + 1 = 256 + 1 = 257 $, which is prime.

Thus, two more primes of the required form are:

$$
\boxed{17} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{257}
$$

### **Part (b)**

We are asked to **exhibit five more primes** of the form:

$$
n^2 + 1
$$

The example given is:

$$
257 = 16^2 + 1
$$

We need to find five more such primes. These are known as **primes of the form $ n^2 + 1 $**. We can compute values for small integers $ n $ and check if the result is a prime.

Let’s compute:

- $ 1^2 + 1 = 2 $ → prime
- $ 2^2 + 1 = 5 $ → prime
- $ 4^2 + 1 = 17 $ → prime
- $ 6^2 + 1 = 37 $ → prime
- $ 10^2 + 1 = 101 $ → prime
- $ 14^2 + 1 = 197 $ → prime

So, five more primes of the form $ n^2 + 1 $ are:

$$
\boxed{5}, \quad \boxed{17}, \quad \boxed{37}, \quad \boxed{101}, \quad \boxed{197}
$$

These are all primes and satisfy the required form. The example $ 257 = 16^2 + 1 $ is included in the list of known such primes, and the five values above are five additional primes of the form $ n^2 + 1 $.

(a) Two more primes that are 1 more than a power of 2:  
$$
\boxed{17} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{257}
$$

(b) Five more primes of the form $ n^2 + 1 $:  
$$
\boxed{5}, \quad \boxed{17}, \quad \boxed{37}, \quad \boxed{101}, \quad \boxed{197}
