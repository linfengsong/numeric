Okay, so I need to show that if a number n is greater than 1, and none of the primes less than or equal to the cube root of n divide it, then n must be either a prime number or the product of two primes. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me recall what the problem says: For any prime p, if p is less than or equal to the cube root of n, then p does not divide n. And we need to show that n is either prime or a product of two primes. 

So, the key here is that n is not divisible by any prime up to its cube root. That suggests that if n is composite, it must have factors that are larger than the cube root of n. But since n is composite, it must have at least two prime factors (not necessarily distinct). Wait, but if n is composite, then it can be written as a product of two numbers greater than 1. Let me think.

Let me start by considering the possible factorizations of n. If n is composite, then it has a factor less than or equal to its square root. Because if n = a * b, then at least one of a or b is less than or equal to sqrt(n). But in this problem, the condition is about primes up to the cube root of n. So maybe I need to relate the cube root to the square root?

Let me think. Suppose n is composite. Then, it has a factor d such that 1 < d < n. If d is not prime, then it can be factored further into primes. But the problem says that n is not divisible by any prime p ≤ cube root of n. Therefore, if n is composite, then all its prime factors must be greater than cube root of n. 

But if n is composite, then it must have at least two prime factors (counting multiplicity). Wait, but maybe not necessarily two distinct primes? For example, if n is a square of a prime, then it's the product of two primes (the same one). 

But let me try to formalize this. Let me suppose that n is composite. Then, there exists a prime factor p of n such that p ≤ sqrt(n). Because if n is composite, then it has a factor d ≤ sqrt(n). But if d is not prime, then it can be factored into primes, each of which is ≤ d ≤ sqrt(n). However, the problem says that n is not divisible by any prime ≤ cube root of n. Therefore, if n is composite, then all its prime factors must be greater than cube root of n. 

But if all prime factors are greater than cube root of n, then how many such primes can there be? Let me think. Suppose n is composite, so it has at least two prime factors (counting multiplicity). Let me suppose that n is the product of two primes, say p and q. Then, since both p and q are greater than cube root of n, then p * q > (cube root of n)^2. But n is p * q, so we have n > (cube root of n)^2. Let me check this inequality.

Let me write n > (n^{1/3})^2. That is, n > n^{2/3}. Which simplifies to n^{1 - 2/3} > 1, so n^{1/3} > 1, which is true for n > 1. So that inequality holds. But this seems like it's just confirming that if n is the product of two primes greater than cube root of n, then n is indeed greater than (cube root of n)^2. But how does this help me?

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the number of prime factors. Suppose that n is composite, so it has at least two prime factors. If all prime factors are greater than cube root of n, then the smallest possible value of n would be if it's the product of two primes, each just slightly larger than cube root of n. But if n is the product of two primes, then each prime is at least cube root of n + 1? Wait, maybe not exactly, but if they are both greater than cube root of n, then their product is greater than (cube root of n)^2. But since n is equal to that product, then n > (cube root of n)^2. Which again is true for n > 1. 

But how does this help me? Maybe I need to use the fact that if n is composite, then it must have a prime factor less than or equal to sqrt(n). But in our case, if n is composite, then all its prime factors are greater than cube root of n. Therefore, if n is composite, then it must have a prime factor between cube root of n and sqrt(n). Wait, but if all prime factors are greater than cube root of n, then if there are two prime factors, then their product is n. But if both primes are greater than cube root of n, then their product is greater than (cube root of n)^2. However, since n is equal to that product, we have n > (cube root of n)^2. Which is equivalent to n^{1/3} > n^{2/3}^{1/2}? Wait, maybe I need to rearrange the inequality.

Let me write n > (n^{1/3})^2. Then, n > n^{2/3}, which implies that n^{1 - 2/3} > 1, so n^{1/3} > 1, which is true for n > 1. So this is always true. Therefore, this doesn't give me any contradiction. 

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Suppose that n is composite, so it has a prime factor p. Since p divides n, and p is a prime, then p is greater than cube root of n. Therefore, if n is composite, then it must have at least two prime factors, each greater than cube root of n. But then, if n is the product of two primes, then those two primes are both greater than cube root of n, so their product is n. Therefore, the smallest possible n in this case would be (cube root of n + 1)^2? But this seems circular. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the fact that if n is composite, then it has a prime factor less than or equal to sqrt(n). But in our case, all prime factors are greater than cube root of n. Therefore, if cube root of n < sqrt(n), which is true for n > 1. Therefore, if n is composite, then it has a prime factor between cube root of n and sqrt(n). But since the problem states that n is not divisible by any prime less than or equal to cube root of n. Therefore, if n is composite, then it must have a prime factor between cube root of n and sqrt(n). But if that's the case, then that prime factor would be a prime that divides n, but since it's between cube root of n and sqrt(n), then it's not less than or equal to cube root of n, so that's okay. But how does this help me?

Wait, but if n is composite, then it must have at least one prime factor less than or equal to sqrt(n). However, the problem says that n is not divisible by any prime less than or equal to cube root of n. Therefore, if n is composite, then it must have a prime factor between cube root of n and sqrt(n). But if n is composite and has a prime factor in that interval, then that prime factor is a prime that divides n, so n is not prime. But how does that help me? 

But if n is composite and has a prime factor between cube root of n and sqrt(n), then n can be written as p * q, where p is a prime between cube root of n and sqrt(n), and q is another factor. But if n is the product of two primes, then q would be another prime. However, if n is the product of more than two primes, then maybe?

But if n is composite, then it can be written as a product of two numbers, say a and b, where a ≤ b. Then, a ≤ sqrt(n). But if a is not prime, then it can be factored further. However, the problem says that n is not divisible by any prime ≤ cube root of n. Therefore, if a is composite, then all its prime factors are greater than cube root of n. But then, if a is composite, then it has a prime factor p > cube root of n. But then p divides a, which divides n, so p divides n. But p is greater than cube root of n. However, since a ≤ sqrt(n), then p ≤ a ≤ sqrt(n). Therefore, p is between cube root of n and sqrt(n). But p is a prime factor of n, which is allowed because the problem only says that n is not divisible by primes ≤ cube root of n. Therefore, p is between cube root of n and sqrt(n), which is allowed. Therefore, if n is composite, then it has at least one prime factor between cube root of n and sqrt(n). 

But how does this help me conclude that n is either prime or product of two primes? 

Wait, maybe if n is composite, then it has a prime factor p between cube root of n and sqrt(n). Let me denote that p. Then, since p divides n, then n = p * k, where k is an integer greater than 1 (since n is composite). Now, k must be at least p, because p ≤ sqrt(n). Wait, no. If p is between cube root of n and sqrt(n), then k = n / p. Since p ≤ sqrt(n), then k ≥ sqrt(n). But p is greater than cube root of n. Therefore, k = n / p. Since p > n^{1/3}, then k < n / n^{1/3} = n^{2/3}. Therefore, k is between n^{2/3} and sqrt(n). Wait, but if p is between n^{1/3} and n^{1/2}, then k is between n^{1/2} and n^{2/3}? Wait, let me check:

If p is between n^{1/3} and n^{1/2}, then n / p is between n / n^{1/2} = n^{1/2} and n / n^{1/3} = n^{2/3}. Therefore, k is between n^{1/2} and n^{2/3}? Wait, that can't be. Wait, n^{1/2} is larger than n^{2/3} when n > 1. For example, take n = 8. n^{1/2} is 2.828, n^{2/3} is 4. So 2.828 < 4. So actually, if p is between n^{1/3} and n^{1/2}, then k is between n^{2/3} and n^{1/2}. Wait, no:

Wait, if p is in [n^{1/3}, n^{1/2}], then k = n / p is in [n / n^{1/2}, n / n^{1/3}] = [n^{1/2}, n^{2/3}]. Therefore, k is between n^{1/2} and n^{2/3}. But since n^{1/2} is less than n^{2/3} for n > 1. So k is between n^{1/2} and n^{2/3}?

But that seems contradictory. Wait, let me take n = 8. Then, cube root of 8 is 2, sqrt(8) is approx 2.828. So p is between 2 and 2.828. Let's say p = 2.5 (not prime, but just for example). Then k = 8 / 2.5 = 3.2. Now, n^{1/2} is 2.828, n^{2/3} is 4. So 3.2 is between 2.828 and 4. So yes, k is between n^{1/2} and n^{2/3}.

But if k is between n^{1/2} and n^{2/3}, then k is greater than n^{1/2} or less than n^{2/3}? Wait, it's between them. But if k is between n^{1/2} and n^{2/3}, then k is greater than n^{1/2}, so k is greater than sqrt(n). But that would mean that k is greater than sqrt(n). However, if n = p * k, and p is less than sqrt(n), then k must be greater than sqrt(n). Therefore, if p is between n^{1/3} and sqrt(n), then k is between sqrt(n) and n^{2/3}. But if k is greater than sqrt(n), then k is at least sqrt(n) + 1, but how does that help?

But if k is greater than sqrt(n), then k must have a prime factor less than or equal to sqrt(k). But since k is between sqrt(n) and n^{2/3}, then sqrt(k) is between n^{1/4} and n^{1/3}. But since n^{1/4} is less than n^{1/3} for n > 1. However, the problem states that n is not divisible by any prime less than or equal to cube root of n. Therefore, if k is between sqrt(n) and n^{2/3}, then sqrt(k) is between n^{1/4} and n^{1/3}. Therefore, if k has a prime factor, that prime factor is less than or equal to sqrt(k), which is less than or equal to n^{1/3}. Therefore, that prime factor would divide n, but the problem says that n is not divisible by any prime less than or equal to n^{1/3}. Therefore, this would lead to a contradiction. Therefore, k cannot have any prime factors less than or equal to n^{1/3}, which would mean that k is prime? Or that k is 1? But k is greater than sqrt(n), so it can't be 1. Therefore, k must be prime?

Wait, let me try to rephrase that. Suppose n is composite, so n = p * k, with p between n^{1/3} and n^{1/2}, and k between n^{1/2} and n^{2/3}. Then, if k is composite, then it has a prime factor, say q, which is less than or equal to sqrt(k). But sqrt(k) is between n^{1/4} and n^{1/3}. Therefore, q ≤ n^{1/3}. But since q divides k, which divides n, then q divides n. However, the problem states that n is not divisible by any prime ≤ n^{1/3}. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, k cannot be composite. Therefore, k must be prime. Therefore, n is the product of two primes, p and k. Therefore, n is either prime or the product of two primes. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that if n is composite, then it must be the product of two primes. Therefore, n is either prime or product of two primes. 

Let me check this logic again. If n is composite, then it can be written as p * k, with p between cube root of n and sqrt(n). Then, k is between sqrt(n) and n^{2/3}. If k is composite, then it has a prime factor q ≤ sqrt(k). But sqrt(k) ≤ n^{1/3}, so q ≤ n^{1/3}. Therefore, q divides n, but the problem says that n is not divisible by any prime ≤ n^{1/3}. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, k must be prime. Therefore, n is the product of two primes. Therefore, n is either prime or product of two primes. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that n must be either prime or product of two primes. 

Let me test this with an example. Let's take n = 25. The cube root of 25 is approximately 2.92. So primes less than or equal to 2.92 are 2. Now, 2 does not divide 25. Therefore, according to the problem's condition, n is 25, which is 5*5. So product of two primes. That works.

Another example: n = 6. Cube root of 6 is approx 1.817. Primes less than or equal to that are 2. But 2 divides 6, so n=6 would not satisfy the condition. Therefore, n=6 is excluded. 

Another example: n = 125. Cube root of 125 is 5. So primes less than or equal to 5 are 2, 3, 5. If n is 125, then 5 divides 125. Therefore, n=125 does not satisfy the condition. 

Another example: n = 30. Cube root of 30 is approx 3.1. Primes ≤ 3.1 are 2, 3. 2 divides 30, so n=30 does not satisfy the condition. 

Another example: n = 25. As before, works. What about n= 121? Cube root of 121 is approx 4.96. Primes ≤ 4.96 are 2, 3. 2 does not divide 121, 3 does not divide 121. Therefore, n=121 is 11*11, which is product of two primes. 

Another example: n= 221. Cube root of 221 is approx 6.04. Primes ≤ 6.04 are 2, 3, 5. 2 does not divide 221, 3 does not divide 221 (2+2+1=5 not divisible by 3), 5 does not divide 221. Therefore, n=221. Is 221 prime? No, 13*17=221. So product of two primes. 

Another example: n= 127. Cube root of 127 is approx 5.02. Primes ≤ 5.02 are 2, 3, 5. 2 does not divide 127, 3 does not divide 127 (1+2+7=10 not divisible by 3), 5 does not divide 127. Therefore, n=127 is prime. 

So in all these examples, the condition holds, and n is either prime or product of two primes. 

Another test case: n= 16. Cube root of 16 is approx 2.519. Primes ≤ 2.519 are 2. 2 divides 16, so n=16 does not satisfy the condition. 

Another test case: n= 25, which is okay. What about n= 2? Well, n>1, but 2 is prime. 

So seems like the logic holds. Therefore, the conclusion is that if n is greater than 1, and not divisible by any prime ≤ cube root of n, then n is either prime or product of two primes. 

Therefore, the answer is that n is either prime or the product of two primes. Therefore, the problem is solved.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{n} is either a prime or the product of two primes.
</think>

To prove that if $ n > 1 $ and $ p \nmid n $ for all primes $ p \leq \sqrt[3]{n} $, then $ n $ must be either a prime number or the product of two primes, we proceed as follows:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Given Condition**

We are told that $ n > 1 $, and for all primes $ p \leq \sqrt[3]{n} $, it is not true that $ p \mid n $. In other words, **no prime less than or equal to the cube root of $ n $ divides $ n $**.

This implies that any prime factor of $ n $ must be **greater than** $ \sqrt[3]{n} $.

---

### **Step 2: Consider the Possibility That $ n $ is Composite**

Suppose $ n $ is **composite**. Then, it must have at least two positive integer factors $ a $ and $ b $, with $ a \leq b $, and $ a \cdot b = n $.

If $ a \leq \sqrt{n} $, then $ b \geq \sqrt{n} $. Therefore, at least one of the factors is less than or equal to $ \sqrt{n} $.

But since $ n $ is not divisible by any prime $ \leq \sqrt[3]{n} $, and $ a \leq \sqrt{n} $, this implies that **$ a $ cannot be a prime** (because all primes $ \leq \sqrt[3]{n} $ do not divide $ n $, and $ a \leq \sqrt{n} $, so $ a $ must be either 1 or a composite number).

So, if $ n $ is composite, then at least one of its factors (say $ a $) is a **composite number**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyzing the Composite Factor**

Let $ n = a \cdot b $, with $ a \leq \sqrt{n} $, and $ a $ composite. Then $ a $ has a prime factor $ p $, and since $ a \leq \sqrt{n} $, we have $ p \leq \sqrt{n} $.

But the problem states that **no prime $ \leq \sqrt[3]{n} $ divides $ n $**, and since $ p \leq \sqrt{n} $, we consider the relationship between $ \sqrt[3]{n} $ and $ \sqrt{n} $.

For $ n > 1 $, we have:

$$
\sqrt[3]{n} < \sqrt{n}
$$

So, if $ p \leq \sqrt{n} $, it is possible that $ p > \sqrt[3]{n} $, which is allowed. But then, since $ p \mid a \mid n $, it must divide $ n $, contradicting the condition that **no prime $ \leq \sqrt[3]{n} $ divides $ n $**.

Thus, **$ a $ cannot be composite**, because that would imply a prime factor $ p \leq \sqrt{n} $ that divides $ n $, which is not allowed.

---

### **Step 4: Conclude That $ n $ Must Be Prime or a Product of Two Primes**

If $ n $ is **not prime**, and not divisible by any prime $ \leq \sqrt[3]{n} $, then it must be the product of **two primes**, both **greater than** $ \sqrt[3]{n} $.

Let $ n = p \cdot q $, where $ p, q \leq \sqrt{n} $, and $ p, q > \sqrt[3]{n} $. Then:

- $ p \cdot q = n $
- $ p, q > \sqrt[3]{n} \Rightarrow p \cdot q > (\sqrt[3]{n})^2 $
- But $ n = p \cdot q $, so $ n > (\sqrt[3]{n})^2 $, which is always true for $ n > 1 $.

Thus, the only way this can happen is if $ n $ is the product of **two primes**.

---

### **Conclusion**

If $ n > 1 $ and $ p \nmid n $ for all primes $ p \leq \sqrt[3]{n} $, then:

- If $ n $ is **not prime**, it must be the product of two primes, both greater than $ \sqrt[3]{n} $.
- If $ n $ is **prime**, then it satisfies the condition trivially.

Therefore, **$ n $ must be either a prime number or the product of two primes**.

---

$$
\boxed{n}
$$ is either a prime or the product of two primes.
