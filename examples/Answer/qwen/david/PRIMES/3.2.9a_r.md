Okay, so I need to prove that if n is greater than 2, then there exists a prime number p such that n is less than p and p is less than n factorial. Hmm, let me think. First, let me recall what n! means. It's the product of all positive integers up to n, right? So n! = n × (n-1) × ... × 2 × 1. 

The problem is asking for a prime number between n and n!. So, for example, if n is 3, then n! is 6. So we need a prime between 3 and 6. Well, 5 is a prime between 3 and 6. That works. For n=4, n! is 24. So primes between 4 and 24 would be 5,7,11,13,17,19,23. So there are plenty. But how do I prove this for any n > 2?

I remember there's something called Wilson's theorem, which says that for a prime p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p. But I don't know if that's directly applicable here. Maybe I need to use some properties of primes and factorials. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of prime gaps? Wait, but I don't remember much about prime gaps. Maybe another approach. Let me think about the interval between n and n!.

First, note that n! is divisible by all numbers from 1 to n. Therefore, n! is divisible by n, n-1, ..., 2, 1. So if I consider the numbers between n and n! - 1, there must be some primes in there. But how do I ensure that there is at least one prime?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of the prime numbers in the interval (n, n!). I know that there are infinitely many primes, but how does that help?

Wait, maybe I should think about the factorial itself. Let's consider the numbers from n+1 up to n! - 1. If I can show that at least one of these numbers is prime, then we are done. But how?

Alternatively, maybe consider the concept of Bertrand's postulate? Wait, Bertrand's postulate says that for any integer n > 1, there is always at least one prime p such that n < p < 2n. But here, the upper bound is n! which is much larger than 2n when n is greater than 2. So maybe Bertrand's postulate is a stronger result, but perhaps I can use it?

But wait, if I can use Bertrand's postulate, then for n > 2, there is a prime between n and 2n. Since 2n is less than n! for n > 2. Because for n ≥ 3, n! = 6, 24, 120, etc., which is way bigger than 2n. For example, when n=3, 2n=6, and n! is 6. So 2n is equal to n! here. But for n=4, 2n=8 and n! is 24. So for n ≥ 3, 2n < n! So if I can use Bertrand's postulate, then there is a prime between n and 2n, which is less than n! So that would be sufficient. But is Bertrand's postulate applicable here?

But wait, Bertrand's postulate is about primes between n and 2n. However, the problem is about primes between n and n!. Since n! is much larger than 2n for n ≥ 4, then certainly there is a prime between n and 2n, hence between n and n!.

But does Bertrand's postulate hold for n > 2? Let me recall. Bertrand's postulate was proven by Chebyshev, and it states that for any integer n ≥ 2, there is always at least one prime p such that n < p < 2n. So yes, for n ≥ 2, there is a prime between n and 2n. Therefore, if n ≥ 3, then 2n < n! (since n! = n × (n-1) × ... × 1, and for n ≥ 3, 2n is less than n! because n! is at least 6, and 2n is 6 when n=3, but for n=4, 2n=8 and n! = 24. So for n ≥ 3, 2n < n! So then, the prime between n and 2n is also between n and n!.

Therefore, if I can use Bertrand's postulate, then the conclusion follows. However, the problem is asking to prove this, so maybe I need to use Bertrand's postulate? But maybe the problem expects a different approach, perhaps without invoking Bertrand's postulate?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of the factorial and the fact that there are primes in the interval (n, n!). Let me think. Let's suppose that there is no prime between n and n!. Then, all numbers from n+1 to n! would be composite. But how can I reach a contradiction?

Alternatively, maybe consider the numbers n+1, n+2, ..., n! - 1. If all of them are composite, then each of them has a prime factor less than or equal to n! - 1. But since n! is divisible by all numbers up to n, then maybe there's a contradiction here?

Wait, but if all numbers between n+1 and n! are composite, then each of them has a prime factor less than or equal to n. But since n! is the product of all numbers up to n, then n! is divisible by all primes up to n. Therefore, if there is a composite number between n+1 and n! , its prime factors are all less than or equal to n. However, if there is a prime number between n and n! , then that would be a prime factor not accounted for in the previous reasoning. Wait, but if there are no primes between n and n! , then all numbers in that interval are composite, so their prime factors are less than or equal to n. However, the problem is that n! is divisible by all numbers up to n, so maybe there's something here.

But how does that lead to a contradiction? Let me think. Suppose that there is no prime between n and n! . Then, every number between n+1 and n! is composite. Therefore, each composite number can be written as a product of primes less than or equal to n. However, since n! is the product of all numbers up to n, then n! is divisible by all primes up to n. But how does that help?

Alternatively, consider the number n! - 1. If there is no prime between n and n! , then n! - 1 is composite. Therefore, it has a prime factor less than or equal to n. However, n! - 1 is congruent to -1 mod n! So, if p is a prime factor of n! - 1, then p divides n! - 1, which implies that n! ≡ 1 mod p. Therefore, the order of n! modulo p divides p-1. But since n! is congruent to 0 mod p if p ≤ n, but wait, if p is a prime factor of n! - 1, then p cannot divide n! because n! ≡ 1 mod p. Therefore, p must be greater than n. Wait, but this contradicts the assumption that there are no primes between n and n!.

Wait, this seems promising. Let me try to formalize this. Suppose that there is no prime between n and n! . Then, in particular, n! - 1 is composite. Therefore, it has a prime factor p. Since n! - 1 is less than n! , and p divides n! - 1, then p must be less than n! . Also, since n! - 1 is not divisible by any number from 1 to n, because n! is divisible by all numbers from 1 to n, so n! - 1 ≡ -1 mod k for any k from 1 to n. Therefore, p cannot be any of the primes up to n. Therefore, p must be a prime greater than n. But if p is a prime greater than n and less than n! , then that would contradict the assumption that there are no primes between n and n! . Therefore, our assumption is wrong. Therefore, there must be at least one prime between n and n! .

Wait, so that seems like a valid proof. Let me check this again. If we suppose that there are no primes between n and n! , then n! - 1 is composite. Therefore, it has a prime factor p. But since n! - 1 is congruent to -1 mod k for any k from 1 to n, so p cannot be any of the numbers from 1 to n. Therefore, p must be greater than n. But p is less than n! because n! - 1 is less than n! . Therefore, p is a prime between n and n! , which contradicts the assumption. Therefore, there must be at least one prime between n and n! . Therefore, the statement is proven.

But wait, this seems like a solid argument. However, I need to make sure that p is indeed less than n! . Well, since n! - 1 is less than n! , and p divides n! - 1, then p must be less than n! . Therefore, p is a prime between n and n! . Therefore, the assumption that there are no primes between n and n! leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there must be at least one prime in that interval.

But wait, is there a possibility that p is equal to n! ? Well, n! is composite, since it's the product of numbers greater than 1. Therefore, p cannot be n! . Therefore, p is strictly less than n! . Therefore, this argument holds. Therefore, this seems like a valid proof.

But then, why is the problem labeled as (a)? Maybe there is a different approach, but this seems correct. Let me check with n=3. n=3, n! =6. The numbers between 3 and 6 are 4,5. 5 is prime. So that works. For n=4, n! =24. The numbers between 4 and 24 include primes like 5,7,11,13,17,19,23. So yes, there are primes. For n=5, n! =120. There are primes between 5 and 120. So the argument seems to hold.

But let me check for n=2. Wait, the problem says n>2, so n=3 and above. So for n=3, the argument works. So the proof seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the number n! - 1. Since n! is divisible by all numbers from 1 to n, then n! - 1 is congruent to -1 mod k for any k from 1 to n. Therefore, n! - 1 is not divisible by any of the numbers from 1 to n. Therefore, if n! - 1 is composite, then it must have a prime factor greater than n. Therefore, there must be a prime between n and n! . Therefore, the conclusion.

Therefore, this seems like a valid proof. Therefore, the answer is that there exists a prime p with n < p < n! for n > 2.

But let me check if there is any possible mistake here. For example, suppose that n! - 1 is a prime itself. Then, that prime would be between n and n! . Therefore, in that case, we are done. However, if n! - 1 is composite, then it has a prime factor greater than n, which is between n and n! . Therefore, regardless of whether n! - 1 is prime or composite, there is a prime between n and n! . Therefore, this seems to hold.

Therefore, the proof is by contradiction. Assume that there is no prime between n and n! . Then, n! - 1 is composite, so it has a prime factor p > n. But p divides n! - 1, so p < n! . Therefore, p is a prime between n and n! , which contradicts the assumption. Therefore, there must be at least one prime between n and n! .

Therefore, the statement is proven.

But maybe there is a case where n! - 1 is prime? For example, when n=3, n! -1=5, which is prime. For n=4, 24-1=23, which is prime. For n=5, 120-1=119, which is 7*17, composite. For n=6, 720-1=719, which is prime. For n=7, 5040-1=5039, which is prime? Wait, I need to check. Let me check n=7. 5040-1=5039. Is 5039 prime? Let me check. Divided by 3: 5+0+3+9=17, not divisible by 3. Divided by 7: 5039/7 is around 719.8... 7*719=5033, 5039-5033=6, so no. Divided by 11: 5-0+3-9= -1, not divisible by 11. Divided by 13: 5039/13 is about 387.6. 13*387= 5031, 5039-5031=8, not divisible. 17? 17*296= 5032, 5039-5032=7, not divisible. 19? 19*265= 5035, 5039-5035=4, not divisible. 23? 23*219= 5037, 5039-5037=2, not divisible. So maybe 5039 is prime. So in that case, n! -1 is prime. Therefore, regardless of whether n! -1 is prime or composite, there is a prime between n and n!.

Therefore, the proof is correct. Therefore, the answer is proven.

Alternatively, maybe there is a case where n! -1 is not prime, but all its prime factors are greater than n! ? But that's impossible, because n! -1 is less than n! , so its prime factors must be less than n! . Therefore, there must be at least one prime factor between n and n! .

Therefore, the conclusion is correct.

Therefore, the proof is done by contradiction, using the fact that n! -1 must have a prime factor greater than n, hence there is a prime between n and n!.

Therefore, the answer is proven.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{p}

Wait, the problem says "Prove that if n > 2, then there exists a prime p satisfying n < p < n! ." So the final answer is just the statement that such a prime exists, but the user might expect a boxed answer. However, in the instructions, they said to put the final answer within \boxed{}.

But since the question is a proof, maybe the answer is just confirming the existence, but in the context of the problem, perhaps the user expects the answer to be \boxed{p} or something else? Wait, no. The problem is to prove that such a prime exists. But since the user is asking for the answer to be boxed, maybe they expect the statement to be confirmed, but in the original problem, maybe the answer is just the existence, but in the context of the problem, maybe the answer is just the statement. However, in the initial problem statement, part (a) is to prove that such a prime exists. However, in the instructions, the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". But since it's a proof, maybe the answer is just confirming the existence, but in math problems, sometimes the answer is just the statement. However, given the way the question is phrased, maybe the answer is simply that there exists such a prime, but in the format, the user might expect a box with the word "prime" or something else. But looking back at the original problem, the user says "Prove that if n > 2, then there exists a prime p satisfying n < p < n! ." So the answer is that such a prime exists. However, in the context of the user's instruction, they might want the answer to be boxed as \boxed{p} or maybe \boxed{\text{prime}}. But since the problem is about existence, maybe the answer is just confirming the existence, but in the absence of specific instructions, perhaps the answer is simply that the prime exists, but given that the user is using a system where they need to put the final answer in a box, maybe they want the answer to be \boxed{p} as a symbol. However, in standard math problems, if the question is to prove existence, the answer is not a numerical value but a statement. However, given that the original problem is in Chinese maybe, but translated, and the user is following the instructions, maybe they expect the answer to be boxed as \boxed{p} or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is part of a series where part (a) is to prove existence, and part (b) is something else, but since the user only provided part (a), maybe the answer is just the statement. However, given that the user is following the instruction to put the final answer within \boxed{}, perhaps the answer is simply \boxed{p} as the prime exists. But I need to check the original problem again.

Wait, the original problem says "Prove that if n > 2, then there exists a prime p satisfying n < p < n! ." So the answer is not a numerical value, but the existence of such a prime. However, in some contexts, when asked to prove something, the answer is just the statement. However, since the user is using a system where they need to put the final answer in a box, maybe they expect the answer to be the prime p, but since p is not a specific value, but just an existence, maybe the answer is simply that such a prime exists, but in the absence of specific instructions, maybe the answer is \boxed{p} as a placeholder. However, in standard math notation, if the question is to prove existence, the answer is not a numerical value. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake in the instructions, but given the problem, maybe the answer is just the statement that such a prime exists, and since the user wants the answer boxed, maybe they expect \boxed{p} as the prime. Alternatively, maybe the answer is \boxed{\text{True}} or something else, but I think that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem is part of a multiple-choice question where the answer is a prime, but since the user hasn't provided options, it's unclear.

But given that the original problem is to prove the existence, and the user is following the instruction to put the final answer in a box, maybe the answer is simply the statement that such a prime exists, but since the system might require a specific format, maybe the answer is \boxed{p} as in the prime p exists. However, in the context of the problem, the answer is not a numerical value but a proof. However, since the user might have intended for the answer to be the prime p, but since p is not unique, maybe the answer is just confirming the existence. Given that, maybe the answer is simply \boxed{p} as the prime exists. But I'm not sure. However, looking at similar problems, sometimes when you're asked to prove existence, the answer is just stating the existence, but in the absence of specific instructions, maybe the answer is \boxed{p}.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a textbook or a standard question where the answer is simply the existence, but the user is expecting the answer to be boxed as per their system. Given that, and since the problem is about proving existence, but the user wants the answer boxed, I think the answer is \boxed{p} as the prime p exists. However, since the problem is in Chinese maybe, but the user has translated it, I think the answer is just the existence, so maybe the answer is \boxed{p}.

But actually, in the original problem statement, the user says "Prove that if n > 2, then there exists a prime p satisfying n < p < n! ." So the answer is not a numerical value, but the existence of such a prime. However, since the user might be expecting a boxed answer, and given that in some contexts, the answer could be represented as \boxed{p}, but I think in the context of the problem, the answer is just the statement that such a prime exists, which is proven. Therefore, maybe the answer is just confirming that, but since the user wants a boxed answer, perhaps they expect \boxed{p} as the prime. However, I'm not entirely sure. Given that, and since the original problem is about existence, I think the answer is simply that such a prime exists, and since the user wants it boxed, maybe they expect \boxed{p}. However, in the absence of specific instructions, I think the correct approach is to state that the prime exists, but since the user might have a different expectation, I'll go with \boxed{p} as the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{p}
</think>

To prove that for any integer $ n > 2 $, there exists a prime number $ p $ such that $ n < p < n! $, we proceed using a **proof by contradiction**.

---

### **Key Observations:**

- The factorial $ n! $ is the product of all integers from 1 to $ n $, so it is divisible by every integer from 1 to $ n $.
- The number $ n! - 1 $ is **not divisible by any integer from 1 to $ n $**, because:
  $$
  n! \equiv 0 \pmod{k} \quad \text{for all } k \in [1, n]
  \Rightarrow n! - 1 \equiv -1 \pmod{k}
  $$
  Hence, $ n! - 1 $ is **not divisible** by any integer from 1 to $ n $.

---

### **Assumption for Contradiction:**

Assume that **there is no prime $ p $** such that $ n < p < n! $. Then, **every number between $ n+1 $ and $ n! - 1 $ is composite**.

This implies that **all composite numbers in the interval $ (n, n!) $** must have prime factors **less than or equal to $ n $**.

---

### **Contradiction:**

Now consider the number $ n! - 1 $. Since it is **not divisible by any number from 1 to $ n $**, it must be **composite** (as we assumed there are no primes in the interval $ (n, n!) $), and thus it must have **at least one prime factor**.

Let $ p $ be such a prime factor of $ n! - 1 $. Since $ p $ divides $ n! - 1 $, we have:
$$
n! \equiv 1 \pmod{p}
\Rightarrow p \nmid n!
$$
But $ p $ is a **prime factor of a number less than $ n! $**, so $ p < n! $.

However, since $ p $ is **not in the range $ [1, n] $** (because $ n! - 1 $ is not divisible by any number in that range), we must have:
$$
n < p < n!
$$
This **contradicts our initial assumption** that there are **no primes in the interval $ (n, n!) $**.

---

### **Conclusion:**

Therefore, our assumption is false. There **must exist at least one prime number $ p $** such that:
$$
n < p < n!
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{p}
$$
