Okay, so I need to prove that for an odd prime number p not equal to 5, either p² - 1 or p² + 1 is divisible by 10. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, since p is an odd prime and not 5, it must be an odd number that isn't divisible by 5. So p can be 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, etc., modulo 10. Wait, actually, primes greater than 5 can't end with 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8. So their last digit must be 1, 3, 7, or 9. Therefore, p mod 10 is 1, 3, 7, or 9. 

So maybe I can consider the possible residues of p modulo 10 and check whether p² - 1 or p² + 1 is divisible by 10. Since 10 is 2*5, maybe I can check divisibility by 2 and 5 separately? But since we need divisibility by 10, which is 2*5, maybe I need to check if either p² - 1 or p² + 1 is divisible by both 2 and 5?

Alternatively, since 10 divides a number if and only if it is divisible by 2 and 5. So maybe I can check for each case whether p² - 1 or p² + 1 is divisible by 2 and 5. Let me try this approach.

First, let's note that p is an odd prime, so p is odd. Therefore, p is congruent to 1 or 3 mod 4, but maybe more importantly, p is odd, so p² is odd squared, which is odd. Therefore, p² - 1 is even, and p² + 1 is even as well? Wait, if p is odd, then p² is odd, so p² - 1 is even, and p² + 1 is even? Wait, no. If p is odd, then p² is odd. Then p² - 1 is even (odd minus 1 is even), and p² + 1 is even (odd plus 1 is even). So both p² - 1 and p² + 1 are even. Therefore, both are divisible by 2. Therefore, if either of them is divisible by 5, then they are divisible by 10. Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that at least one of p² - 1 or p² + 1 is divisible by 5. 

So the problem is equivalent to showing that for an odd prime p ≠ 5, either p² ≡ 1 mod 5 or p² ≡ -1 mod 5. Which would mean that p² ≡ 1 or 4 mod 5 (since -1 mod 5 is 4). Wait, but let me check that.

Alternatively, since p is not divisible by 5, p is invertible modulo 5. Therefore, p can be congruent to 1, 2, 3, or 4 mod 5. Let me compute p² mod 5 for each case:

If p ≡ 1 mod 5, then p² ≡ 1² ≡ 1 mod 5.

If p ≡ 2 mod 5, then p² ≡ 4 mod 5.

If p ≡ 3 mod 5, then p² ≡ 9 ≡ 4 mod 5.

If p ≡ 4 mod 5, then p² ≡ 16 ≡ 1 mod 5.

So in all cases, p² ≡ 1 or 4 mod 5. Therefore, p² - 1 ≡ 0 or 3 mod 5, and p² + 1 ≡ 2 or 0 mod 5. Therefore, in either case, either p² - 1 is divisible by 5 or p² + 1 is divisible by 5. Therefore, since both p² - 1 and p² + 1 are even, then one of them must be divisible by 10.

Wait, so that would mean that for any odd prime p not equal to 5, either p² - 1 or p² + 1 is divisible by 10. Therefore, the statement is proven. 

But let me check with some examples to make sure. Let's take p=3. Then p²=9. p² -1=8, which is not divisible by 10, but p² +1=10, which is divisible by 10. So that works. 

p=7: 7²=49. 49-1=48, not divisible by 10. 49+1=50, which is divisible by 10. 

p=11: 121 -1=120, which is divisible by 10. 121 +1=122, not. 

p=13: 169 -1=168, not. 169 +1=170, which is divisible by 10. 

p=17: 289 -1=288, not. 289 +1=290, which is divisible by 10. 

p=19: 361 -1=360, which is divisible by 10. 361 +1=362, not. 

So seems like for primes not equal to 5, either p² -1 or p² +1 is divisible by 10. 

But let me check p=2. Wait, p=2 is even, but the problem says p is an odd prime. So p=2 is excluded. 

Another example, p=7, which we did. 

So the logic seems correct. Since p is not divisible by 5, so p mod 5 is 1,2,3,4. Then p² mod 5 is 1 or 4, so p² -1 is 0 or 3 mod 5, and p² +1 is 2 or 0 mod 5. Therefore, one of them is 0 mod 5. Therefore, since both are even, then one of them is divisible by 10. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that either p² -1 or p² +1 is divisible by 10. 

But let me think again. Suppose p ≡ 1 mod 5, then p² -1 ≡ 0 mod 5. Since p is odd, p² -1 is even, so divisible by 2 and 5, so 10. 

If p ≡ 2 mod 5, then p² ≡ 4 mod 5, so p² +1 ≡ 0 mod 5. Since p is odd, p² +1 is even, so divisible by 10. 

Similarly, if p ≡ 3 mod 5, then p² ≡ 9 ≡ 4 mod 5, so p² +1 ≡ 0 mod 5. Again, since p is odd, p² +1 is even, so divisible by 10. 

If p ≡ 4 mod 5, then p² ≡ 16 ≡ 1 mod 5, so p² -1 ≡ 0 mod 5. Again, since p is odd, p² -1 is even, so divisible by 10. 

Therefore, in all cases, one of them is divisible by 5 and since both are even, divisible by 10. Therefore, the statement is proven. 

Therefore, the answer is that either p² -1 or p² +1 is divisible by 10. 

But let me check if there is a case where both are divisible by 10? For example, if p² -1 is divisible by 10 and p² +1 is also divisible by 10? That would mean that p² -1 ≡ 0 mod 10 and p² +1 ≡ 0 mod 10. Then subtracting the two equations, we get (p² +1) - (p² -1) = 2 ≡ 0 mod 10, which would imply 2 ≡ 0 mod 10, which is false. Therefore, they cannot both be divisible by 10. Therefore, exactly one of them is divisible by 10. 

Therefore, the conclusion is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Since p is odd, p is congruent to 1 or -1 mod 4? Wait, not sure. But since we already did the modulo 5 analysis, which seems sufficient. 

Another approach: Since p is not divisible by 5, then p is invertible modulo 5, so the multiplicative order of p modulo 5 divides 4 (since 5 is prime, the multiplicative group has order 4). Therefore, p^4 ≡ 1 mod 5. Therefore, p² is either 1 or -1 mod 5. Wait, because if p² ≡ 1 mod 5, then p^4 ≡ 1 mod 5. If p² ≡ -1 mod 5, then p^4 ≡ 1 mod 5. Therefore, p² ≡ ±1 mod 5. Therefore, p² -1 ≡ 0 or -2 mod 5, and p² +1 ≡ 2 or 0 mod 5. Therefore, again, one of them is 0 mod 5. Therefore, same conclusion. 

Therefore, regardless of the approach, we get that one of p² -1 or p² +1 is divisible by 5, and since both are even, then one of them is divisible by 10. 

Therefore, the statement is proven. 

I think that's solid. So the answer is that either p² -1 or p² +1 is divisible by 10, which is proven by considering the possible residues of p modulo 5 and the fact that p is odd, leading to both p² -1 and p² +1 being even, and one of them being divisible by 5. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{10}
</think>

To prove that for an odd prime $ p \neq 5 $, either $ p^2 - 1 $ or $ p^2 + 1 $ is divisible by 10, we proceed by analyzing the properties of $ p $ modulo 10 and its square.

---

### Step 1: Understand the nature of $ p $

Given that $ p $ is an **odd prime** and $ p \neq 5 $, we know:

- $ p $ is **not divisible by 2** or 5.
- Therefore, $ p $ must end in 1, 3, 7, or 9 (i.e., $ p \mod 10 \in \{1, 3, 7, 9\} $).

This is because the only possible last digits of primes greater than 5 are 1, 3, 7, or 9 — any other digit would make the number even or divisible by 5.

---

### Step 2: Consider the parity of $ p^2 - 1 $ and $ p^2 + 1 $

Since $ p $ is odd, $ p^2 $ is also odd. Therefore:

- $ p^2 - 1 $ is even,
- $ p^2 + 1 $ is even.

So both expressions are divisible by 2.

Thus, to show that **either** $ p^2 - 1 $ or $ p^2 + 1 $ is divisible by 10, it suffices to show that **at least one** of them is divisible by **5**, since 10 = 2 × 5 and the two expressions are already even.

---

### Step 3: Use modular arithmetic modulo 5

Since $ p \neq 5 $, $ p $ is invertible modulo 5. That is, $ p \mod 5 \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\} $. We compute $ p^2 \mod 5 $ for each possible residue:

- $ p \equiv 1 \mod 5 \Rightarrow p^2 \equiv 1^2 = 1 \mod 5 $
- $ p \equiv 2 \mod 5 \Rightarrow p^2 \equiv 4 \mod 5 $
- $ p \equiv 3 \mod 5 \Rightarrow p^2 \equiv 9 \equiv 4 \mod 5 $
- $ p \equiv 4 \mod 5 \Rightarrow p^2 \equiv 16 \equiv 1 \mod 5 $

Thus, $ p^2 \mod 5 \in \{1, 4\} $, and so:

- If $ p^2 \equiv 1 \mod 5 $, then $ p^2 - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 5 $
- If $ p^2 \equiv 4 \mod 5 $, then $ p^2 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 5 $

Therefore, **in all cases**, **either** $ p^2 - 1 $ or $ p^2 + 1 $ is divisible by 5.

---

### Step 4: Combine the results

We have shown that:

- Both $ p^2 - 1 $ and $ p^2 + 1 $ are even.
- At least one of them is divisible by 5.

Hence, **at least one** of them is divisible by both 2 and 5, i.e., by 10.

---

### Final Conclusion

For any odd prime $ p \neq 5 $, either $ p^2 - 1 $ or $ p^2 + 1 $ is divisible by 10.
