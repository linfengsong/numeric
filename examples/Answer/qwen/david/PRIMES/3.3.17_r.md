Okay, so I need to show that the numbers 509 and 877 disprove de Polignac's claim. The claim is that every odd integer can be expressed as the sum of a prime number and a power of 2. Let me try to understand what this means. 

First, let me recall that a power of 2 is a number like 2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, and so on. So, for any odd number, there should exist some prime number p and some integer k ≥ 0 such that the odd number equals p + 2^k.

Now, the task is to show that 509 and 877 cannot be written in such a way. So, I need to check if there exists a prime number p and a power of 2, 2^k, such that p + 2^k equals 509 or 877. If for both numbers, there is no such combination, then they disprove the claim.

Let me start with 509. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can try subtracting different powers of 2 from 509 and check if the result is a prime number. Since 509 is odd, and 2^k is even for k ≥ 1, and 2^0=1 is odd. So, if I subtract 2^k from 509, the result will be odd minus even (for k ≥1) which is odd, or odd minus odd (if k=0) which is even. But since primes except 2 are odd, so if we subtract 2^k, we need the result to be a prime. 

But since 509 is odd, if we subtract 2^k, then:

- If k ≥ 1: 509 - 2^k is odd - even = odd. So, the result is odd, so it could be a prime (except 2, which is even). So, possible.

- If k = 0: 509 - 1 = 508, which is even. The only even prime is 2, so 508 is not prime. Therefore, for k=0, it's not possible. Therefore, we need to check for k ≥1.

So, for 509, we need to check if there exists some integer k ≥1 such that 509 - 2^k is a prime.

Similarly for 877.

So, let me start with 509. Let me try to find such k.

First, let's think about possible values of k. Since 2^k must be less than 509, so k can be from 1 up to floor(log2(509)).

What is log2(509)? Well, 2^8 = 256, 2^9=512. So, 2^9 is 512, which is larger than 509. Therefore, k can be from 1 to 8.

So, k=1 to 8. Let me check each of these.

For k=1: 2^1=2. 509 - 2 = 507. Is 507 prime? Let me check. 507 divided by 3 is 169, because 3*169=507. 169 is 13^2. Therefore, 507 is 3*13^2, so not prime.

k=2: 2^2=4. 509 - 4 = 505. 505 ends with 5, so divisible by 5. 505=5*101. Not prime.

k=3: 8. 509 - 8 = 501. 501: sum of digits is 5+0+1=6, divisible by 3. 501/3=167. So, 3*167, not prime.

k=4: 16. 509 - 16 = 493. Let me check if 493 is prime. Hmm. Let me try dividing by small primes. 493 divided by 17: 17*29 is 493? 17*29 is 493? Let me check 17*29: 17*30=510, minus 17 is 493. Yes! So 17*29=493. Therefore, not prime.

k=5: 32. 509 - 32 = 477. 477: sum of digits is 4+7+7=18, divisible by 3. 477/3=159. Not prime.

k=6: 64. 509 - 64 = 445. Ends with 5, so divisible by 5. 445=5*89. Not prime.

k=7: 128. 509 - 128 = 381. 3+8+1=12, divisible by 3. 381/3=127. 127 is prime, but 381 is 3*127. So not prime.

k=8: 256. 509 - 256 = 253. Let me check if 253 is prime. Divided by 11? 11*23=253? 11*23 is 253. Yes, 11*23=253. Therefore, not prime.

So for k from 1 to 8, none of the results are prime. Therefore, 509 cannot be expressed as a prime plus a power of 2. Therefore, 509 discredits the claim.

Wait, but let me check if I missed something. Maybe k can be higher? Wait, 2^9 is 512, which is larger than 509, so 509 - 512 would be negative, which is not possible. So k can't be higher than 8. Therefore, 509 is indeed not expressible as a prime plus a power of 2. Therefore, 509 is a counterexample.

Now, moving on to 877. Let me do the same process. Check if 877 can be written as p + 2^k, where p is prime and k ≥0.

Again, similar approach. Let me check for k from 0 up to floor(log2(877)).

First, log2(877). 2^10 is 1024, which is larger than 877. 2^9 is 512. So, k can be from 0 to 9.

But let's check:

For k=0: 877 - 1 = 876. Which is even, so not prime (except 2). 876 is even and greater than 2, so not prime.

For k=1: 877 - 2 = 875. Ends with 5, so divisible by 5. 875=5*175, not prime.

k=2: 877 - 4 = 873. Sum of digits is 8+7+3=18, divisible by 3. 873/3=291, not prime.

k=3: 877 - 8 = 869. Check if 869 is prime. Let me try dividing by small primes. Let me check divisibility by 7: 7*124=868, so 869-868=1. Not divisible by 7. Next, 11: 11*79=869? Let me check 11*79: 11*80=880, minus 11 is 869. Yes! So 11*79=869. Therefore, not prime.

k=4: 877 - 16 = 861. 8+6+1=15, divisible by 3. 861/3=287. Not prime.

k=5: 877 - 32 = 845. Ends with 5, divisible by 5. 845=5*169=5*13^2. Not prime.

k=6: 877 - 64 = 813. Sum of digits 8+1+3=12, divisible by 3. 813/3=271. 271 is a prime? Let me check. 271: it's not even, not divisible by 3 (2+7+1=10 not divisible by 3). Divided by 5? No. 7? 7*38=266, 271-266=5, not divisible by 7. 11? 11*24=264, 271-264=7, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*20=260, 271-260=11, not divisible by 13. 17? 17*15=255, 271-255=16, not divisible by 17. So 271 is prime. Therefore, 813=3*271. So not prime.

k=7: 877 - 128 = 749. Check if 749 is prime. Let me check. Divided by 7? 7*107=749? 7*100=700, 7*7=49, so 700+49=749. Yes! 7*107=749. Therefore, not prime.

k=8: 877 - 256 = 621. Sum of digits 6+2+1=9, divisible by 3. 621/3=207, not prime.

k=9: 877 - 512 = 365. Ends with 5, divisible by 5. 365=5*73. Not prime.

So, for k from 0 to 9, none of the results are prime. Therefore, 877 cannot be expressed as a prime plus a power of 2. Therefore, 877 also discredits the claim.

Wait, but let me check again for k=7, 877 - 128 = 749. Wait, 7*107 is 749? Let me verify that. 7*100=700, 7*7=49, so 700+49=749. Yes. So 7*107=749, which is composite. So that's correct.

Similarly, for k=6, 813 is 3*271, which is composite.

So, all possibilities checked. Therefore, both 509 and 877 cannot be expressed as the sum of a prime and a power of 2, which means that de Polignac's claim is false.

But wait, let me check again for 509. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation?

For k=8: 509 - 256 = 253. 253 divided by 11 is 23, so 11*23=253. Correct. So that's composite.

For k=7: 509 - 128= 381. 381 divided by 3 is 127. 127 is prime, but 381 is 3*127. So composite.

k=6: 509 - 64=445. Divided by 5 is 89. So composite.

k=5: 509 - 32=477. Divided by 3 is 159. Composite.

k=4: 509 - 16=493. Divided by 17 is 29. 17*29=493. Correct.

k=3: 509 - 8=501. Divided by 3 is 167. Composite.

k=2: 509 - 4=505. Divided by 5 is 101. Composite.

k=1: 509 - 2=507. Divided by 3 is 169. Composite.

So yes, all of them are composite. Therefore, 509 is not expressible as such.

Similarly for 877, all the subtractions result in composite numbers. Therefore, both 509 and 877 are counterexamples.

Therefore, the claim is false.

But just to be thorough, let me check if there is a possibility that for some k, maybe a larger power of 2? Wait, but 2^k must be less than 877. Since 2^10 is 1024, which is larger than 877, so k can be up to 9. Which we checked.

Alternatively, maybe negative powers? But 2^k where k is a non-negative integer. Negative exponents would give fractions, which are not integers, so not relevant here.

Therefore, I think that both 509 and 877 cannot be written as the sum of a prime and a power of 2. Therefore, they disprove the claim.

But just to make sure, let me check if there's any possible way that maybe for 509 or 877, there is a prime that I missed. For example, maybe for 509, if I take a larger k? But k can't be larger than 8, since 2^9 is 512, which is larger than 509. So 509 - 512 is negative. Not possible.

Similarly for 877, 2^10 is 1024, which is larger than 877, so k can't be 10.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in checking for primes. Let me check some of the numbers again.

For 509 - 2^k:

k=8: 253. 253: 11*23=253. Correct.

k=7: 381. 3*127. Correct.

k=6: 445. 5*89. Correct.

k=5: 477. 3*159. Correct.

k=4: 493. 17*29. Correct.

k=3: 501. 3*167. Correct.

k=2: 505. 5*101. Correct.

k=1: 507. 3*13^2. Correct.

So all composite. For 877:

k=9: 365. 5*73. Correct.

k=8: 621. 3*207. Correct.

k=7: 749. 7*107. Correct.

k=6: 813. 3*271. Correct.

k=5: 845. 5*169. Correct.

k=4: 861. 3*287. Correct.

k=3: 869. 11*79. Correct.

k=2: 873. 3*291. Correct.

k=1: 875. 5*175. Correct.

k=0: 876. Even. Correct.

So all of them are composite. Therefore, both 509 and 877 cannot be written as the sum of a prime and a power of 2. Therefore, they disprove the claim.

Therefore, the answer is that 509 and 877 cannot be expressed in such a way, hence discrediting de Polignac's claim.

**Final Answer**
The integers 509 and 877 disprove de Polignac's claim, so the answer is \boxed{509} and \boxed{877}.

But wait, the problem says "Show that the integers 509 and 877 discredit this claim." So, the answer should probably just state that they disprove the claim, but the question says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". However, the original problem might expect the answer to be the numbers themselves, but since the question is to show that they disprove the claim, maybe the answer is just stating that they are counterexamples. But in the instructions, the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". However, in the problem statement, it's not clear if they need to box the numbers or something else. But looking back, the original problem says "Show that the integers 509 and 877 discredit this claim." So, maybe the answer is just confirming that these numbers are counterexamples, but since the user wants the final answer boxed, perhaps they need to be boxed. However, in the problem statement, the example given is 55 = 47 + 2^3 = 23 + 2^5, so the user is to show that 509 and 877 cannot be expressed as such. Since the problem says "discredit this claim", the answer is that these numbers are counterexamples. But the user instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Maybe the answer is that the claim is false, but since the user is to show that 509 and 877 disprove it, perhaps the answer is to box the numbers. However, in the original problem, maybe the answer is just stating that they are counterexamples, but since the user is following the instruction to put the final answer in a box, maybe the answer is \boxed{509} and \boxed{877} as the two numbers that disprove the claim. But in the problem statement, the user is to "show that the integers 509 and 877 discredit this claim", so the answer is that these numbers are examples of the claim being false. However, since the user instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", and the problem is in the style of a math competition problem where you have to show that these numbers are counterexamples, but the answer is the numbers themselves. However, in the original problem, the example is given as 55, so maybe the answer is to state that 509 and 877 cannot be expressed in such a way. But since the user wants the answer boxed, perhaps the answer is that they are counterexamples, but I need to check.

Wait, looking at the problem again: "Show that the integers 509 and 877 discredit this claim." So the task is to show that they are counterexamples. However, the user instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Maybe the answer is that the claim is false, but since the question is about showing that 509 and 877 disprove it, perhaps the answer is just the numbers. But in math problems, sometimes the answer is the numbers that disprove the claim. However, in the problem statement, the user is to "show that the integers 509 and 877 discredit this claim", so the answer is that they are counterexamples. But the user might expect the answer to be boxed numbers. But in the original problem statement, the example is given with 55, so maybe the answer is to write that 509 and 877 cannot be expressed as such, but since the user wants the answer boxed, maybe they need to be boxed. However, in the problem statement, the user is to "show that the integers 509 and 877 discredit this claim", so the answer is that these numbers are counterexamples. But since the user instruction says to put the final answer in a box, maybe the answer is just the numbers, so boxed 509 and 877. However, in the problem statement, the example is given with 55, so maybe the answer is to state that 509 and 877 are counterexamples, but the user might need to write them boxed. However, the original problem might have the answer as the numbers, so I think the answer is that the claim is false because 509 and 877 cannot be expressed as the sum of a prime and a power of 2. But since the user wants the answer boxed, and the problem says "discredit this claim", maybe the answer is just stating that these numbers are the counterexamples. However, in the context of the problem, since the user is to show that they disprove the claim, the answer is that they are counterexamples. But the user might expect the answer to be the numbers, so I think the answer is \boxed{509} and \boxed{877}. However, in some cases, the problem might expect the answer to be the numbers, so I'll go with that.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{509} and \boxed{877}
</think>

To disprove de Polignac's claim that **every odd integer can be expressed as the sum of a prime number and a power of 2**, we need to find **at least one odd integer** that **cannot** be written in the form:

$$
\text{odd} = p + 2^k
$$

where $ p $ is a prime number, and $ k $ is a non-negative integer.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Structure

- A **power of 2** is of the form $ 2^k $, where $ k \geq 0 $.
- The sum $ p + 2^k $ must be an **odd integer**, so:
  - If $ k \geq 1 $, then $ 2^k $ is even, and thus $ p $ must be **odd**.
  - If $ k = 0 $, then $ 2^0 = 1 $, and $ p = \text{odd} - 1 $, which is even. The only even prime is 2, so $ p = 2 $ is the only possibility.

Hence, for any odd number $ N $, we can check whether $ N - 2^k $ is a prime number for some $ k \geq 0 $.

---

### Step 2: Check for 509

We test all possible values of $ k $ such that $ 2^k < 509 $ (i.e., $ k \leq 8 $):

| $ k $ | $ 2^k $ | $ 509 - 2^k $ | Is it prime? |
|--------|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| 1      | 2         | 507              | No (divisible by 3) |
| 2      | 4         | 505              | No (divisible by 5) |
| 3      | 8         | 501              | No (divisible by 3) |
| 4      | 16        | 493              | No (17 × 29) |
| 5      | 32        | 477              | No (divisible by 3) |
| 6      | 64        | 445              | No (divisible by 5) |
| 7      | 128       | 381              | No (divisible by 3) |
| 8      | 256       | 253              | No (11 × 23) |

**Conclusion for 509**: None of the values $ 509 - 2^k $ are prime. Therefore, **509 cannot be expressed as the sum of a prime and a power of 2**.

---

### Step 3: Check for 877

We test all values of $ k $ such that $ 2^k < 877 $ (i.e., $ k \leq 9 $):

| $ k $ | $ 2^k $ | $ 877 - 2^k $ | Is it prime? |
|--------|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| 1      | 2         | 875              | No (divisible by 5) |
| 2      | 4         | 873              | No (divisible by 3) |
| 3      | 8         | 869              | No (11 × 79) |
| 4      | 16        | 861              | No (divisible by 3) |
| 5      | 32        | 845              | No (divisible by 5) |
| 6      | 64        | 813              | No (divisible by 3) |
| 7      | 128       | 749              | No (7 × 107) |
| 8      | 256       | 621              | No (divisible by 3) |
| 9      | 512       | 365              | No (divisible by 5) |

**Conclusion for 877**: None of the values $ 877 - 2^k $ are prime. Therefore, **877 cannot be expressed as the sum of a prime and a power of 2**.

---

### Final Conclusion

Since **both 509 and 877 cannot be written as the sum of a prime and a power of 2**, they **discredit** de Polignac's claim.

$$
\boxed{509} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{877}
$$
