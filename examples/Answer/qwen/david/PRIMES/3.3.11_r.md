Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer n for which each of these functions f(n), g(n), and h(n) results in a composite number. Let me start with the first one, f(n) = n² + n + 17. 

First, I remember that a composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. So, I need to find the smallest n where f(n) is not prime. Let me try plugging in small values of n and check if the result is composite.

Starting with n=1: 1² + 1 + 17 = 1 + 1 + 17 = 19. 19 is a prime number. So not composite.

n=2: 4 + 2 + 17 = 23. Also prime. Hmm.

n=3: 9 + 3 + 17 = 29. Prime again. 

n=4: 16 + 4 + 17 = 37. Still prime. 

n=5: 25 + 5 + 17 = 47. Prime. 

n=6: 36 + 6 + 17 = 59. Prime. 

n=7: 49 + 7 + 17 = 73. Prime. 

n=8: 64 + 8 + 17 = 89. Prime. 

n=9: 81 + 9 + 17 = 107. Prime. 

n=10: 100 + 10 + 17 = 127. Prime. 

Hmm, this is interesting. Up to n=10, all the results are primes. Maybe I need to check higher numbers. Let me try n=11: 121 + 11 + 17 = 149. Prime. 

n=12: 144 + 12 + 17 = 173. Prime. 

n=13: 169 + 13 + 17 = 199. Prime. 

n=14: 196 + 14 + 17 = 227. Prime. 

n=15: 225 + 15 + 17 = 257. Prime. 

Wait, 257 is a prime number, right? Yes, it's a known prime. 

n=16: 256 + 16 + 17 = 289. Oh! 289 is 17 squared. 17*17=289. So that's composite. Therefore, n=16 is the first n where f(n) is composite. 

But let me check if there's a smaller n that I might have missed. Wait, up to n=15, all were primes. So n=16 is the answer for f(n). 

Okay, moving on to g(n) = n² + 21n + 1. I need to find the smallest positive integer n where this is composite. Again, start testing small n.

n=1: 1 + 21 + 1 = 23. Prime.

n=2: 4 + 42 + 1 = 47. Prime.

n=3: 9 + 63 + 1 = 73. Prime.

n=4: 16 + 84 + 1 = 101. Prime.

n=5: 25 + 105 + 1 = 131. Prime.

n=6: 36 + 126 + 1 = 163. Prime.

n=7: 49 + 147 + 1 = 197. Prime.

n=8: 64 + 168 + 1 = 233. Prime.

n=9: 81 + 189 + 1 = 271. Prime.

n=10: 100 + 210 + 1 = 311. Prime.

n=11: 121 + 231 + 1 = 353. Prime.

n=12: 144 + 252 + 1 = 397. Prime.

n=13: 169 + 273 + 1 = 443. Prime.

n=14: 196 + 294 + 1 = 491. Prime.

n=15: 225 + 315 + 1 = 541. Prime.

n=16: 256 + 336 + 1 = 593. Prime.

n=17: 289 + 357 + 1 = 647. Prime.

n=18: 324 + 378 + 1 = 703. Hmm, 703. Let me check if that's prime. 

Wait, 703. Let me try dividing by small primes. 703 divided by 19 is 37? 19*37 is 703? Let me check: 19*30=570, 19*7=133, so 570+133=703. Yes! So 703 is 19*37. Therefore composite. Therefore, n=18 is the answer for g(n)?

But wait, maybe there is a smaller n? Wait, up to n=17, all were primes. So n=18 is the first composite. But let me check n=17 again. 17² + 21*17 + 1 = 289 + 357 + 1 = 647. Is 647 prime? Let me check. 

Divide by 2? No. 3? 6+4+7=17, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7. 7? 7*92=644, 647-644=3, not divisible by 7. 11? 6-4+7=9, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*49=637, 637+13=650, which is higher. 647-637=10, not divisible by 13. 17? 17*38=646, 647-646=1. Not divisible by 17. 19? 19*34=646, same as above. So 647 is prime. Therefore, n=18 is the first composite for g(n). 

But wait, let me check n=0? Wait, the problem says positive integer, so n starts at 1. So n=18 is the answer. 

But let me check n=19. 19² + 21*19 + 1 = 361 + 399 + 1 = 761. Is 761 prime? Let me check. Divided by 2? No. 3? 7+6+1=14, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 1. 7? 7*108=756, 761-756=5, not divisible by 7. 11? 7-6+1=2, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*58=754, 754+13=767, which is higher. 761-754=7, not divisible by 13. 17? 17*44=748, 748+17=765, which is higher. 761-748=13, not divisible by 17. 19? 19*40=760, 761-760=1. So 761 is prime. So n=18 is the first composite for g(n). 

Now moving on to h(n) = 3n² + 3n + 23. Find the smallest positive integer n where this is composite. Again, start testing small n.

n=1: 3 + 3 + 23 = 29. Prime.

n=2: 12 + 6 + 23 = 41. Prime.

n=3: 27 + 9 + 23 = 59. Prime.

n=4: 48 + 12 + 23 = 83. Prime.

n=5: 75 + 15 + 23 = 113. Prime.

n=6: 108 + 18 + 23 = 149. Prime.

n=7: 147 + 21 + 23 = 191. Prime.

n=8: 192 + 24 + 23 = 239. Prime.

n=9: 243 + 27 + 23 = 293. Prime.

n=10: 300 + 30 + 23 = 353. Prime.

n=11: 363 + 33 + 23 = 419. Prime.

n=12: 432 + 36 + 23 = 491. Prime.

n=13: 507 + 39 + 23 = 569. Prime.

n=14: 588 + 42 + 23 = 653. Prime.

n=15: 675 + 45 + 23 = 743. Prime.

n=16: 768 + 48 + 23 = 839. Prime.

n=17: 867 + 51 + 23 = 941. Prime.

n=18: 972 + 54 + 23 = 1049. Let me check if 1049 is prime. 

Divide by 2? No. 3? 1+0+4+9=14, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 9. 7? 7*149=1043, 1049-1043=6, not divisible by 7. 11? 1 - 0 + 4 - 9 = -4, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*80=1040, 1049-1040=9, not divisible by 13. 17? 17*61=1037, 1049-1037=12, not divisible by 17. 19? 19*55=1045, 1049-1045=4, not divisible by 19. 23? 23*45=1035, 1049-1035=14, not divisible by 23. 29? 29*36=1044, 1049-1044=5, not divisible by 29. 31? 31*33=1023, 1023+31=1054, which is higher. So 1049 is prime. 

n=19: 3*(361) + 3*19 + 23 = 1083 + 57 + 23 = 1163. Check if prime. 

Divide by 2? No. 3? 1+1+6+3=11, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 3. 7? 7*166=1162, 1163-1162=1, not divisible by 7. 11? 1 - 1 + 6 - 3 = 3, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*89=1157, 1163-1157=6, not divisible by 13. 17? 17*68=1156, 1163-1156=7, not divisible by 17. 19? 19*61=1159, 1163-1159=4, not divisible by 19. 23? 23*50=1150, 1163-1150=13, not divisible by 23. 29? 29*40=1160, 1163-1160=3, not divisible by 29. So 1163 is prime. 

n=20: 3*(400) + 60 + 23 = 1200 + 60 + 23 = 1283. Check if prime. 

Divide by 2? No. 3? 1+2+8+3=14, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 3. 7? 7*183=1281, 1283-1281=2, not divisible by 7. 11? 1 - 2 + 8 - 3 = 4, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*98=1274, 1283-1274=9, not divisible by 13. 17? 17*75=1275, 1283-1275=8, not divisible by 17. 19? 19*67=1273, 1283-1273=10, not divisible by 19. 23? 23*55=1265, 1283-1265=18, not divisible by 23. 29? 29*44=1276, 1283-1276=7, not divisible by 29. 31? 31*41=1271, 1283-1271=12, not divisible by 31. So 1283 is prime. 

Hmm, this is getting tedious. Maybe I need a better approach. Let me think. Maybe there's a value of n where 3n² + 3n + 23 is composite. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to factor this expression or find when it's divisible by some small prime. 

Alternatively, maybe I can check for n where the expression is even? Let's see. 3n² + 3n + 23. Let me check parity. 

If n is even: n=2k. Then 3*(4k²) + 3*(2k) + 23 = 12k² + 6k + 23. Which is even + even + odd = odd. 

If n is odd: n=2k+1. Then 3*(4k² + 4k +1) + 3*(2k+1) +23 = 12k² + 12k + 3 + 6k + 3 +23 = 12k² + 18k + 29. Which is even + even + odd = odd. So regardless of n being even or odd, the expression is odd. Therefore, it's not divisible by 2. 

So maybe check divisibility by 3? Let's see. 3n² + 3n + 23. Modulo 3, this is 0 + 0 + 23 mod 3. 23 divided by 3 is 7*3=21, remainder 2. So 2 mod 3. Therefore, the expression is congruent to 2 mod 3. Therefore, not divisible by 3. 

Divisibility by 5? Let's check. Let me compute 3n² + 3n + 23 mod 5. 

Which is 3n² + 3n + 3 mod 5 (since 23 mod 5 is 3). 

So 3(n² + n + 1) mod 5. Let me check for n mod 5. 

If n ≡ 0 mod 5: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, 3*1=3 mod5. Not 0.

n≡1: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 3*3=9≡4 mod5.

n≡2: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7≡2, 3*2=6≡1 mod5.

n≡3: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13≡3, 3*3=9≡4 mod5.

n≡4: 16 + 4 + 1 = 21≡1, 3*1=3 mod5.

So in none of the cases is the expression congruent to 0 mod5. Therefore, not divisible by 5. 

How about 7? Let me check. Maybe trying to find n where 3n² + 3n + 23 ≡ 0 mod7. 

Let me compute 3n² + 3n + 23 mod7. 23 mod7 is 2. So 3n² + 3n + 2 ≡ 0 mod7. 

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime). So n² + n + (2/3) ≡ 0 mod7. But 2/3 mod7 is equivalent to 2*5=10≡3 mod7, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so inverse of 3 is 5. Therefore, equation becomes n² + n + 3 ≡ 0 mod7. 

Let me check for n from 0 to 6:

n=0: 0 + 0 +3=3≠0.

n=1: 1 +1 +3=5≠0.

n=2: 4 + 2 +3=9≡2≠0.

n=3: 9 + 3 +3=15≡1≠0.

n=4: 16 +4 +3=23≡2≠0.

n=5: 25 +5 +3=33≡5≠0.

n=6: 36 +6 +3=45≡3≠0.

So no solutions. Therefore, the expression is never divisible by 7. 

How about 11? Let me check. 3n² + 3n + 23 ≡ 0 mod11. 23 mod11 is 1. So 3n² + 3n +1 ≡0 mod11. Multiply by inverse of 3 mod11. 3*4=12≡1 mod11, so inverse is 4. Multiply both sides by 4: 4*3n² + 4*3n + 4*1 ≡0 mod11. Which is 12n² + 12n +4 ≡0 mod11. 12≡1 mod11, so equation becomes n² + n +4 ≡0 mod11. 

Check n from 0 to 10:

n=0: 0 + 0 +4=4≠0.

n=1:1+1+4=6≠0.

n=2:4+2+4=10≠0.

n=3:9+3+4=16≡5≠0.

n=4:16 +4 +4=24≡2≠0.

n=5:25 +5 +4=34≡1≠0.

n=6:36 +6 +4=46≡46-44=2≠0.

n=7:49 +7 +4=60≡60-55=5≠0.

n=8:64 +8 +4=76≡76-66=10≠0.

n=9:81 +9 +4=94≡94-88=6≠0.

n=10:100 +10 +4=114≡114-110=4≠0.

No solutions. So not divisible by 11. 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe trying to check for n where the expression is composite. Since up to n=20, all are primes. Maybe I need to check higher n. Alternatively, perhaps there's a value of n where the expression factors. 

Alternatively, maybe trying to find when 3n² + 3n +23 is composite. Let me try n=21:

3*(441) + 3*21 +23 = 1323 + 63 +23 = 1409. Check if prime. 

Divide by 2? No. 3? 1+4+0+9=14, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 9. 7? 7*201=1407, 1409-1407=2, not divisible by 7. 11? 1 - 4 + 0 - 9 = -12, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*108=1404, 1409-1404=5, not divisible by 13. 17? 17*82=1394, 1409-1394=15, not divisible by 17. 19? 19*74=1406, 1409-1406=3, not divisible by 19. 23? 23*61=1403, 1409-1403=6, not divisible by 23. 29? 29*48=1392, 1409-1392=17, not divisible by 29. 31? 31*45=1395, 1409-1395=14, not divisible by 31. So 1409 is prime. 

n=22: 3*(484) + 66 +23 = 1452 + 66 +23 = 1541. Check if composite. 

Divide by 23? 23*67=1541? 23*60=1380, 23*7=161, so 1380+161=1541. Yes! So 23*67=1541. Therefore, composite. Therefore, n=22 is the answer for h(n). 

Wait, but let me check if there is a smaller n. Up to n=21, all were primes. So n=22 is the first composite. 

But let me check n=22 again. 3*(22)^2 + 3*22 + 23. 22 squared is 484, times 3 is 1452. 3*22 is 66. 1452 + 66 is 1518, plus 23 is 1541. Yes, which is 23*67. 

But wait, is there a smaller n where this is composite? Let me check n=19, 20, 21. For n=19, we had 1163, which is prime. n=20: 1283, prime. n=21: 1409, prime. So yes, n=22 is the first. 

Therefore, the answers are:

For f(n): 16

For g(n): 18

For h(n): 22

But let me check again for h(n). Maybe I made a mistake. For example, n= - something? But n must be positive. So n=22 is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a value between n=1 and 22 that I missed? Let me check n=14 again. Wait, for h(n), n=14: 3*(14)^2 + 3*14 +23 = 3*196 + 42 +23 = 588 + 42 +23 = 653. Which is prime. n=15: 3*225 + 45 +23= 675 + 45 +23= 743, prime. n=16: 3*256 + 48 +23= 768 + 48 +23= 839, prime. n=17: 3*289 + 51 +23= 867 + 51 +23= 941, prime. n=18: 3*324 + 54 +23= 972 + 54 +23= 1049, prime. n=19: 3*361 + 57 +23= 1083 + 57 +23= 1163, prime. n=20: 3*400 + 60 +23= 1200 + 60 +23= 1283, prime. n=21: 3*441 + 63 +23= 1323 + 63 +23= 1409, prime. n=22: 1541, composite. So yes, 22 is the first. 

Therefore, the answers are 16, 18, 22. 

But let me check for h(n) again. Maybe there is a smaller n where the expression is composite. For example, n= - something? But n must be positive. So no. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in checking for n= something. Let me check n= 23? 3*(23)^2 + 3*23 +23. Wait, 3*(529) + 69 +23 = 1587 + 69 +23= 1679. Check if composite. 1679. Let me check divisibility. Divided by 23? 23*73= 1679? 23*70=1610, 23*3=69, so 1610+69=1679. Yes! So 23*73=1679. But since n=23 gives composite, but n=22 is smaller. 

So yes, 22 is the answer for h(n). 

Therefore, the final answers are:

For f(n): 16

For g(n): 18

For h(n): 22

**Final Answer**
The smallest positive integers are $\boxed{16}$ for $f(n)$, $\boxed{18}$ for $g(n)$, and $\boxed{22}$ for $h(n)$.
</think>

To find the smallest positive integer $ n $ such that each of the functions $ f(n) = n^2 + n + 17 $, $ g(n) = n^2 + 21n + 1 $, and $ h(n) = 3n^2 + 3n + 23 $ yields a **composite number**, we proceed by evaluating each function for small positive integers and checking whether the result is **not prime**.

### **1. Function $ f(n) = n^2 + n + 17 $**

We evaluate $ f(n) $ for increasing values of $ n $:

- $ f(1) = 1 + 1 + 17 = 19 $ → prime
- $ f(2) = 4 + 2 + 17 = 23 $ → prime
- $ f(3) = 9 + 3 + 17 = 29 $ → prime
- ...
- $ f(16) = 256 + 16 + 17 = 289 = 17^2 $ → **composite**

Thus, the **smallest** $ n $ for which $ f(n) $ is composite is:

$$
\boxed{16}
$$

---

### **2. Function $ g(n) = n^2 + 21n + 1 $**

Evaluate $ g(n) $ for small values of $ n $:

- $ g(1) = 1 + 21 + 1 = 23 $ → prime
- $ g(2) = 4 + 42 + 1 = 47 $ → prime
- ...
- $ g(18) = 324 + 378 + 1 = 703 = 19 \times 37 $ → **composite**

Thus, the **smallest** $ n $ for which $ g(n) $ is composite is:

$$
\boxed{18}
$$

---

### **3. Function $ h(n) = 3n^2 + 3n + 23 $**

Evaluate $ h(n) $ for small values of $ n $:

- $ h(1) = 3 + 3 + 23 = 29 $ → prime
- $ h(2) = 12 + 6 + 23 = 41 $ → prime
- ...
- $ h(22) = 3(484) + 66 + 23 = 1452 + 66 + 23 = 1541 = 23 \times 67 $ → **composite**

Thus, the **smallest** $ n $ for which $ h(n) $ is composite is:

$$
\boxed{22}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answers:

- $ f(n) $: $ \boxed{16} $
- $ g(n) $: $ \boxed{18} $
- $ h(n) $: $ \boxed{22} $
