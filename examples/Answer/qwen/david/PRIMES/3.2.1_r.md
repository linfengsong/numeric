Okay, so I need to figure out if 701 and 1009 are prime numbers by testing all primes up to their square roots. Let me start with 701 first. 

First, I remember that to check if a number is prime, you have to test divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of that number. If none of them divide the number evenly, then it's prime. So, I need to find the square root of 701. Let me calculate that. 

The square root of 701... Well, 26 squared is 676, and 27 squared is 729. Since 701 is between those two, the square root of 701 is between 26 and 27. So, I need to check all prime numbers up to 26. Let me list the primes less than or equal to 26. 

Primes up to 26 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. Wait, is 23 the last one? Let me check. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. Yes, next prime after 23 is 29, which is larger than 26, so we stop at 23. 

So, I need to check if 701 is divisible by any of these primes. Let me go one by one.

Starting with 2: 701 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2. 

Next, 3: To check divisibility by 3, add the digits: 7 + 0 + 1 = 8. 8 is not divisible by 3, so 701 isn't divisible by 3.

Next, 5: The last digit is 1, not 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.

Next, 7: Let me do the division. 7 times 100 is 700, so 701 divided by 7 is 100 with a remainder of 1. So, 7 doesn't divide 701.

Next, 11: The rule for 11 is alternating sum of digits. Let me do that. For 701: (7 + 1) - 0 = 8. 8 is not divisible by 11, so 701 isn't divisible by 11.

Next, 13: Let me try dividing 701 by 13. 13 times 50 is 650. 701 - 650 = 51. 13 times 3 is 39, 51 - 39 = 12. So remainder 12. Not divisible by 13.

Next, 17: Let me calculate 17 times 41 is 697. 17*41=697. Then 701 - 697 = 4. So remainder 4. Not divisible by 17.

Next, 19: Let me try 19*36 = 684. 19*37 = 684 + 19 = 703. That's more than 701. So 19*36 = 684, 701 - 684 = 17. Not divisible by 19.

Next, 23: Let me check 23*30 = 690. 701 - 690 = 11. 23*30 + 11 = 701. So remainder 11. Not divisible by 23. 

So none of the primes up to 23 divide 701. Therefore, 701 is prime. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make an error.

Let me check 7 again. 7*100=700, so 7*100 +1=701. So yes, remainder 1. Correct. 13: 13*53 is 689, 13*54 is 702. 701 is between those, so remainder 701 - 689 = 12. Correct. 17: 17*41=697, 701-697=4. Correct. 19: 19*36=684, 701-684=17. Correct. 23: 23*30=690, 701-690=11. Correct. So, yes, none of these primes divide 701. Therefore, 701 is prime. 

Now moving on to 1009. Let me do the same process. First, find the square root of 1009. Well, 31 squared is 961, 32 squared is 1024. So sqrt(1009) is between 31 and 32. Therefore, I need to check all primes up to 31. 

Primes up to 31 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31. 

So, check divisibility by each of these primes. Let me start with 2: 1009 is odd, so not divisible by 2.

3: Sum of digits: 1 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 10. 10 isn't divisible by 3, so not divisible by 3.

5: Ends with 9, so no.

7: Let me divide 1009 by 7. 7*144 is 1008. So 7*144 = 1008. Then 1009 - 1008 = 1. So remainder 1. Not divisible by 7.

11: Alternating sum: (1 + 0) - (0 + 9) = 1 - 9 = -8. Not divisible by 11.

13: Let me calculate 13*77 = 1001. 13*77=1001. Then 1009 - 1001 = 8. So remainder 8. Not divisible by 13.

17: Let me try 17*59 = 1003. 17*59: 17*60=1020, minus 17 is 1003. Then 1009 - 1003 = 6. Remainder 6. Not divisible by 17.

19: 19*53 = 1007. 19*53: 19*50=950, 19*3=57, so 950+57=1007. 1009 - 1007 = 2. Remainder 2. Not divisible by 19.

23: Let me try 23*43 = 989. 23*40=920, 23*3=69, so 920+69=989. Then 23*44=989+23=1012. Which is more than 1009. So 1009 - 989 = 20. Not divisible by 23.

29: Let me calculate 29*34 = 986. 29*35 = 986 + 29 = 1015. Which is more than 1009. So 1009 - 986 = 23. Not divisible by 29.

31: Let me check 31*32 = 992. 31*32=992. Then 31*33=992+31=1023. Which is more than 1009. So 1009 - 992 = 17. Not divisible by 31.

So none of the primes up to 31 divide 1009. Therefore, 1009 is prime. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes I might have miscalculated.

For 7: 7*144=1008. Correct. 1009-1008=1. Correct. For 13: 13*77=1001. 1001+13=1014. So 1009-1001=8. Correct. For 17: 17*59=1003. 1003+17=1020. 1009-1003=6. Correct. 19*53=1007. 1007+19=1026. 1009-1007=2. Correct. 23*43=989. 989+23=1012. 1009-989=20. Correct. 29*34=986. 986+29=1015. 1009-986=23. Correct. 31*32=992. 992+31=1023. 1009-992=17. Correct. 

So all of these checks confirm that none of the primes up to 31 divide 1009. Therefore, 1009 is prime. 

But wait, just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's any prime between 31 and sqrt(1009). Wait, sqrt(1009) is approximately 31.76, so primes up to 31.76. So the primes up to 31 are sufficient. Since the next prime is 37, which is larger than 31.76, so we don't need to check beyond 31. Therefore, our checks are complete. 

Therefore, both 701 and 1009 are prime numbers. 

But wait, just to be 100% sure, maybe I should check if I made any mistake in the calculation for 1009. Let me check 23 again. 23*43 is 989. 23*43: 20*43=860, 3*43=129, so 860+129=989. Correct. 1009-989=20. 20 is not divisible by 23. 

How about 29? 29*34 is 986. 29*34: 30*34=1020, minus 1*34=34, so 1020-34=986. Correct. 1009-986=23. 23 is not divisible by 29. 

And 31*32=992. 31*32: 30*32=960, 1*32=32, total 992. Correct. 1009-992=17. Not divisible by 31. 

So yes, all correct. Therefore, both numbers are prime. 

Wait, but just to be extra cautious, maybe I should check if there's a prime between 31 and sqrt(1009). Wait, sqrt(1009) is approx 31.76, so primes up to 31.76. The primes less than or equal to 31.76 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31. The next prime is 37, which is higher than 31.76. So we don't need to check beyond 31. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that both 701 and 1009 are prime numbers. 

But just to make sure, maybe I should check with another method. For example, for 701, maybe I can check if it's a known prime. Wait, I think 701 is a prime number. Let me recall. 701 is a prime. For 1009, I think that's also a prime. In fact, 1009 is a prime number, and it's sometimes used as a prime in cryptography. 

But since the problem says to test all primes up to sqrt(n), and we did that, so our answer is correct. 

Therefore, both 701 and 1009 are prime numbers.

**Final Answer**
The integers 701 and 1009 are both prime. Therefore, the answers are \boxed{701} is prime and \boxed{1009} is prime.

Wait, but the problem says "Determine whether the integer 701 is prime... Do the same for the integer 1009". So the answer should be stating whether they are prime. But the user instruction says to put the final answer within \boxed{}.

But the original question is to determine if they are prime. However, the way the problem is phrased, maybe the user expects a confirmation. However, since the user might want the answer in boxed format for each, but the original problem says "Determine whether...". However, in the problem statement, it's possible that the user wants to know if they are prime, so maybe the answer is that both are prime, and the final answer should be boxed as such. But the system might expect two boxed answers? Wait, looking back at the problem:

"Determine whether the integer 701 is prime by testing all primes p ≤√701 as possible divisors. Do the same for the integer 1009."

So the user wants to know if 701 is prime and 1009 is prime. Since both are prime, the answer is that both are prime. However, the user instruction says to put the final answer within \boxed{}.

But maybe the answer is to state that 701 is prime and 1009 is prime, so maybe boxed as \boxed{701} is prime and \boxed{1009} is prime. But I need to check the standard way. However, in many cases, when asked to determine if a number is prime, the answer is just stating whether it is or not. However, since the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", maybe they want the answer as "Yes" or "No" for each? But the original problem says "Determine whether...", so maybe the answer is to confirm that both are prime. However, the standard practice in math problems is that if the question is to determine if a number is prime, and the answer is yes, then you can just say it's prime. However, since the user is asking for the answer in boxed, maybe they want the numbers themselves boxed as primes? But that might not make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to know if they are prime, so the answer is that both are primes, so maybe boxed as \boxed{701} and \boxed{1009} are prime. But I need to check the original problem again.

Looking back, the original problem says "Determine whether the integer 701 is prime... Do the same for the integer 1009". So the answer is to state that both are prime. However, since the user might expect a single boxed answer for each, but the problem is in the format of two numbers. However, given the way the question is structured, perhaps the answer is to confirm that both are prime, so maybe the answer is that both are primes, so boxed as \boxed{701} is prime and \boxed{1009} is prime. However, since the user might be expecting two separate boxed answers. Alternatively, maybe the answer is just stating that they are primes, but since the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", perhaps they want the answer as "Both are prime", but that is not boxed. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is to write "701 is prime" and "1009 is prime", each in a box. But given that the user might have intended for the answer to be that both are prime, and given that in some contexts, the answer is to write the numbers as primes, but since the question is to determine if they are prime, the answer is that they are prime. However, since the user might have intended for the answer to be boxed, perhaps each number is boxed as prime. But I need to check standard practice. 

In many cases, when asked to determine if a number is prime, and the answer is yes, you can say the number is prime, but since the user wants the answer in boxed, perhaps they want the numbers themselves boxed. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that both are primes, so the final answer is that they are primes, but how to box that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting the answer to be "Yes" for both, but in boxed. But the problem says "Determine whether...", so maybe the answer is that both are prime, so the answer is \boxed{701} and \boxed{1009} are prime. But I think the standard way is to answer with the numbers if they are prime, but since the question is to determine if they are prime, maybe the answer is simply stating that they are prime. However, given that the user might have a specific format, perhaps the answer is that both are prime, so boxed as \boxed{701} and \boxed{1009}. But I think that might not be standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is to write that both are prime, so the final answer is that both are prime, so boxed as \boxed{701} is prime and \boxed{1009} is prime. However, since the user might have intended for the answer to be that they are prime, and the problem is to determine that, perhaps the answer is just stating that both are prime, but given the system's requirement for boxed answers, maybe the answer is that both are prime, so boxed as \boxed{701} and \boxed{1009}. 

But I think in the context of the problem, since the user is asking to determine if they are prime, and the answer is that they are, then the final answer is that both are primes. However, since the user instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", maybe the answer is to write that both numbers are prime, but how to box that. Alternatively, since the original problem is in Chinese maybe, but translated, maybe the answer is to state that they are prime, so the answer is \boxed{701} is prime and \boxed{1009} is prime. But I think that's not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the answer as "Both are prime", but boxed. However, I think that the correct way is to state that both numbers are prime, so the final answer is that 701 is prime and 1009 is prime. Therefore, I will write that both are prime, and box them as such. But since the user might expect separate boxes, but given that the original question is about two numbers, perhaps the answer is two boxed numbers. However, the standard practice for such problems is to answer with the numbers if they are prime. But since the question is to determine if they are prime, the answer is "Yes" for both. But since the user might be expecting the numbers to be boxed, I think the answer is that both are prime, so boxed as \boxed{701} and \boxed{1009} are prime. However, I need to check the exact instructions again.

The original problem says: "Determine whether the integer 701 is prime... Do the same for the integer 1009". So the answer is that both are prime. Since the user instruction says to put the final answer within \boxed{}, maybe the answer is to write "Both 701 and 1009 are prime numbers", but boxed. However, standard practice in math problems is that if you are to determine if a number is prime, and it is, you can just say it is. However, since the user is asking for the answer in boxed, maybe they expect the answer to be the numbers themselves as primes, but that is not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that 701 is prime and 1009 is prime, so boxed as \boxed{701} and \boxed{1009}. But I think that's not correct. Alternatively, since the problem is to determine if they are prime, and the answer is yes, then the answer is "Yes" for both. But the user might want the numbers to be boxed. 

But given that the original problem is in Chinese, maybe the user is following a specific format. However, since I can't be sure, but in most cases, when asked to determine if a number is prime, and the answer is yes, you can just say it is, but given the instructions here, I think the answer is that both are prime, so I'll put them in boxes as primes. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is to state that both are prime, so the final answer is:

\boxed{701} is prime and \boxed{1009} is prime.

But since the user might expect two separate answers, but given the way the problem is structured, maybe the answer is that both are prime, and the final answer is both boxed. However, since I can't be sure, but given the initial problem says "Determine whether...", and the answer is that both are prime, I think the correct way is to state that both are prime, so I'll put them in boxes.

**Final Answer**
The integer 701 is prime and the integer 1009 is prime. Therefore, the answers are \boxed{701} and \boxed{1009}.
</think>

To determine whether the integers **701** and **1009** are prime, we apply the standard primality test: check divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number.

- **None of these primes divide 701**, so **701 is prime**.

---

### Step 2: Prime Check for 1009

---
