Okay, so I need to verify that 1949 and 1951 are twin primes. Hmm, first, let me recall what twin primes are. Twin primes are pairs of prime numbers that are two apart. So, for example, 3 and 5 are twin primes because they are both primes and their difference is 2. Similarly, 11 and 13 are twin primes. So, in this case, we need to check if both 1949 and 1951 are primes and that their difference is 2. 

First, let me check if 1949 is a prime number. To do that, I need to verify that it doesn't have any divisors other than 1 and itself. Similarly for 1951. 

But how do I check if a number is prime? Well, one method is to check divisibility by all primes up to the square root of the number. Let me recall that if a number n is not prime, then it has a factor less than or equal to the square root of n. So, first, I need to find the square root of 1949 and 1951 to know up to which number I need to check for factors.

Let me calculate the square root of 1949. Let me approximate. 44 squared is 1936, because 40 squared is 1600, 44 squared is (40 + 4)^2 = 1600 + 320 + 16 = 1936. Then 45 squared is 2025. So sqrt(1949) is between 44 and 45. Let me compute 44.1 squared: 44^2 + 2*44*0.1 + 0.1^2 = 1936 + 8.8 + 0.01 = 1944.81. Then 44.2 squared is 44.1^2 + 2*44.1*0.1 + 0.1^2 = 1944.81 + 8.82 + 0.01 = 1953.64. Wait, but 44.2 squared is 1953.64, which is higher than 1949. So sqrt(1949) is between 44.1 and 44.2. Therefore, to check if 1949 is prime, I need to check divisibility by all primes up to 44. Similarly for 1951.

But maybe I can check primes up to 44. Let me list the primes up to 44. The primes less than or equal to 44 are:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43.

So, I need to check if 1949 is divisible by any of these primes. Similarly for 1951.

Let me start with 1949.

First, check if 1949 is even? No, it ends with 9, so not divisible by 2.

Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 1949 is 1 + 9 + 4 + 9 = 23. 23 is not divisible by 3, so 1949 is not divisible by 3.

Next, check divisibility by 5: It doesn't end with 0 or 5, so no.

Next, 7: Let me do the division. 1949 divided by 7. Let me compute 7*278 = 1946. Then 1949 - 1946 = 3. So remainder 3. Not divisible by 7.

Next prime is 11. The rule for 11 is alternating sum of digits. Let me compute (1 + 4) - (9 + 9) = 5 - 18 = -13. Since -13 is not divisible by 11, 1949 is not divisible by 11.

Next prime is 13. Let me try dividing 1949 by 13. Let me compute 13*149 = 1937. Then 1949 - 1937 = 12. So remainder 12. Not divisible by 13.

Next prime is 17. Let me compute 17*114 = 1938. 1949 - 1938 = 11. Not divisible by 17.

Next prime is 19. 19*102 = 1938. 1949 - 1938 = 11. Again, remainder 11. Not divisible by 19.

Next prime is 23. Let me compute 23*84 = 1932. 1949 - 1932 = 17. Not divisible by 23.

Next prime is 29. Let me see 29*67 = 1943. 29*67: 29*60=1740, 29*7=203, so total 1740+203=1943. Then 1949 - 1943 = 6. Not divisible by 29.

Next prime is 31. Let me compute 31*62 = 1922. 31*62: 30*62=1860, 1*62=62, total 1922. Then 1949 - 1922 = 27. Not divisible by 31.

Next prime is 37. Let me compute 37*52 = 1924. 37*52: 37*50=1850, 37*2=74, total 1924. Then 1949 - 1924 = 25. Not divisible by 37.

Next prime is 41. Let me compute 41*47 = 1927. 41*47: 40*47=1880, 1*47=47, total 1927. Then 1949 - 1927 = 22. Not divisible by 41.

Next prime is 43. Let me compute 43*45 = 1935. 43*45: 40*45=1800, 3*45=135, total 1935. Then 1949 - 1935 = 14. Not divisible by 43.

So, none of the primes up to 43 divide 1949. Therefore, 1949 is a prime number.

Now let me check 1951.

Again, check if 1951 is prime. First, check divisibility by 2: it's odd, so no. Divisible by 3? Sum of digits: 1 + 9 + 5 + 1 = 16. 16 is not divisible by 3. Not divisible by 5, since it doesn't end with 0 or 5.

Check divisibility by 7: Let me compute 1951 divided by 7. 7*278 = 1946. 1951 - 1946 = 5. Not divisible by 7.

Divisibility by 11: Alternating sum: (1 + 5) - (9 + 1) = 6 - 10 = -4. Not divisible by 11.

Divisibility by 13: Let me compute 13*150 = 1950. Then 1951 - 1950 = 1. So remainder 1. Not divisible by 13.

Divisibility by 17: Let me compute 17*114 = 1938. 1951 - 1938 = 13. Not divisible by 17.

Divisibility by 19: 19*102 = 1938. 1951 - 1938 = 13. Not divisible by 19.

Divisibility by 23: Let me compute 23*84 = 1932. 1951 - 1932 = 19. Not divisible by 23.

Divisibility by 29: 29*67 = 1943. 1951 - 1943 = 8. Not divisible by 29.

Divisibility by 31: 31*62 = 1922. 1951 - 1922 = 29. Not divisible by 31.

Divisibility by 37: Let me compute 37*52 = 1924. 1951 - 1924 = 27. Not divisible by 37.

Divisibility by 41: 41*47 = 1927. 1951 - 1927 = 24. Not divisible by 41.

Divisibility by 43: 43*45 = 1935. 1951 - 1935 = 16. Not divisible by 43.

So, none of the primes up to 43 divide 1951. Therefore, 1951 is also a prime number.

Therefore, both 1949 and 1951 are primes, and their difference is 1951 - 1949 = 2. Therefore, they are twin primes.

Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there are any primes between 44 and sqrt(1951). Wait, sqrt(1951) is a bit more than 44. Let me check sqrt(1951). Since 44^2 = 1936, 45^2 = 2025. So sqrt(1951) is between 44 and 45. So, same as before. So, since we checked all primes up to 43, which is less than sqrt(1951), then we have covered all possible factors. Therefore, our checks are sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe I can check if 1949 is a prime by another method? For example, maybe check if it's a known prime. But since I don't have a list here, I have to do the division.

Alternatively, maybe I can check for some other factors. For example, 1949. Let me check if it's divisible by 7 again. Wait, earlier I did 7*278 = 1946, remainder 3. So no. How about 19? 19*102 = 1938, remainder 11. So no. 23: 23*84 = 1932, remainder 17. So no.

Alternatively, maybe check if 1949 is a prime by checking some other primes. Wait, but we checked all primes up to 43. Since 43 is the largest prime less than sqrt(1949), which is approx 44.1. So, that's sufficient.

Same for 1951. So, I think the conclusion is correct. Therefore, 1949 and 1951 are twin primes.

But just to be extra careful, maybe I can check if there's a mistake in my calculations. Let me recheck some of the divisions.

Starting with 1949 divided by 7: 7*278. Let me compute 7*200=1400, 7*70=490, 7*8=56. So 1400+490=1890, 1890+56=1946. Yes, 7*278=1946. 1949-1946=3. Correct.

For 1951 divided by 13: 13*150=1950. 1951-1950=1. Correct.

For 1951 divided by 17: 17*114. Let me compute 17*100=1700, 17*14=238, so total 1700+238=1938. 1951-1938=13. Correct.

For 1951 divided by 23: 23*84. 23*80=1840, 23*4=92, total 1840+92=1932. 1951-1932=19. Correct.

For 1951 divided by 29: 29*67. 29*60=1740, 29*7=203, total 1740+203=1943. 1951-1943=8. Correct.

For 1951 divided by 31: 31*62. 30*62=1860, 1*62=62, total 1922. 1951-1922=29. Correct.

For 1951 divided by 37: 37*52. 37*50=1850, 37*2=74, total 1924. 1951-1924=27. Correct.

For 1951 divided by 41: 41*47. 40*47=1880, 1*47=47, total 1927. 1951-1927=24. Correct.

For 1951 divided by 43: 43*45. 40*45=1800, 3*45=135, total 1935. 1951-1935=16. Correct.

So all those divisions check out. Therefore, I think my conclusion is correct. Therefore, both numbers are primes, and they are two apart, so they are twin primes.

But just to make sure, maybe I can check if there's any other way to verify. For example, maybe check if 1949 is a prime using another method. For example, maybe check if it's part of a known prime pair. But since I don't have that information, I need to rely on my calculations.

Alternatively, maybe check with another prime. For example, 1949 divided by 7 is 278.428..., which is not integer. Divided by 11, 1949 / 11 is approx 177.18... Not integer. Divided by 13, approx 149.92... Not integer. So, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe check if 1949 is a prime by looking at its factors. But since we have checked all primes up to sqrt(n), and none divide it, then it is prime.

Therefore, I think I can confidently say that 1949 and 1951 are twin primes.

**Final Answer**
The integers 1949 and 1951 are twin primes, so the answer is \boxed{(1949, 1951)}.
</think>

To verify that the integers **1949** and **1951** are **twin primes**, we must confirm two key properties:

1. **Both numbers are prime.**
2. **Their difference is exactly 2.**

---

### Step 1: Confirm the Difference

We first check the difference between the two numbers:

$$
1951 - 1949 = 2
$$

This satisfies the condition for being **twin primes**, as twin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 2.

---

### Step 2: Verify Both Numbers Are Prime

To confirm that both 1949 and 1951 are prime, we must ensure that they have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

#### **Checking 1949:**

We check divisibility by all primes less than or equal to the square root of 1949. Since:

$$
\sqrt{1949} \approx 44.1
$$

We check primes up to 43:

- **2**: 1949 is odd → Not divisible by 2.
- **3**: Sum of digits is 1 + 9 + 4 + 9 = 23 → Not divisible by 3.
- **5**: Ends in 9 → Not divisible by 5.
- **7**: 1949 ÷ 7 = 278.428... → Not divisible.
- **11**: Alternating sum is 1 + 4 - (9 + 9) = -13 → Not divisible.
- **13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43**: All give remainders when dividing 1949.

No prime up to 43 divides 1949. Hence, **1949 is prime**.

---

#### **Checking 1951:**

Similarly, we check divisibility of 1951 by primes up to 44 (since $\sqrt{1951} \approx 44.1$):

- **2**: 1951 is odd → Not divisible.
- **3**: Sum of digits is 1 + 9 + 5 + 1 = 16 → Not divisible.
- **5**: Ends in 1 → Not divisible.
- **7**: 1951 ÷ 7 = 278.714... → Not divisible.
- **11**: Alternating sum is 1 + 5 - (9 + 1) = -4 → Not divisible.
- **13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43**: All give remainders when dividing 1951.

No prime up to 43 divides 1951. Hence, **1951 is prime**.

---

### Final Conclusion

Since both **1949** and **1951** are prime numbers and their difference is exactly **2**, they are confirmed to be **twin primes**.

$$
\boxed{(1949, 1951)}
$$
