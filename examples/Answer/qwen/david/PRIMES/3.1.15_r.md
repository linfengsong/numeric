Okay, so I need to prove that a positive integer a > 1 is a square if and only if in its canonical form (which I think is the prime factorization), all the exponents of the primes are even integers. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the canonical form of a number is. It's the prime factorization, right? So any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes raised to some exponents. For example, 12 is 2² * 3¹. 

The problem is saying that a number is a square if and only if all exponents in its prime factorization are even. So, first, I need to prove both directions: if a number is a square, then all exponents are even, and conversely, if all exponents are even, then the number is a square. 

Let me start with the first direction: if a is a square, then all exponents in its prime factorization are even. Suppose a is a square. That means there exists some integer b such that a = b². Let me think about the prime factorization of b. If b is expressed as the product of primes raised to some exponents, then when you square it, each exponent gets multiplied by 2. So if b = p₁^e₁ * p₂^e₂ * ... * pₙ^eₙ, then b² = p₁^(2e₁) * p₂^(2e₂) * ... * pₙ^(2eₙ). Therefore, in the prime factorization of a = b², each exponent is twice that of b, so they must all be even. That seems straightforward. 

Now the other direction: if all exponents in the prime factorization of a are even, then a is a square. So suppose that a has a prime factorization where each exponent is even. Let me denote a as p₁^(2k₁) * p₂^(2k₂) * ... * pₙ^(2kₙ). Then, if I take the square root of a, would that be an integer? Let me think. If I take the square root of each prime power, then sqrt(p₁^(2k₁)) is p₁^k₁, similarly for the others. So multiplying them all together, sqrt(a) would be p₁^k₁ * p₂^k₂ * ... * pₙ^kₙ, which is an integer. Therefore, a is a square. 

Wait, but is there a case where even exponents might not lead to a square? Let me test with an example. Take 36, which is 2² * 3². The square root is 6, which is integer. How about 16, which is 2⁴. Square root is 4, integer. What about 1? Well, the problem says a > 1, so 1 is excluded. How about 25, which is 5². Its prime factorization is 5², which has even exponent. So that works. What about a number like 4, which is 2². Yep, square. 

But wait, what if there's a prime with exponent zero? Wait, no, in the prime factorization, primes with exponent zero aren't included. So if all exponents are even, then each exponent is at least 2? No, not necessarily. For example, if a number is 1, but since a > 1, maybe the exponents can be zero? Wait, no. If a number is greater than 1, then in its prime factorization, all exponents are at least 1. But if all exponents are even, then they are at least 2? Wait, no. For example, if a number is 1, but since a > 1, maybe the exponents can be zero? Wait, no. For example, take a number like 2² * 3⁰. But 3⁰ is 1, so that's just 2², which is 4. But in that case, the prime factorization is 2², and 3⁰ is not part of it. So in the canonical form, primes with exponent zero are not included. Therefore, if all exponents in the canonical form are even, then each exponent is even and at least 2? No, because if a number is a square, like 4, which is 2², then the exponent is 2, which is even. But if you have a number like 1, which is 1, but since a > 1, maybe the exponents can be zero? Wait, but 1 is not considered here. 

Wait, maybe I need to be careful here. Suppose that a is a square, then its prime factorization has exponents even. If all exponents are even, then the number is a square. So, for example, if a number is 1, which is 1, but since a > 1, we don't have to consider that. So for numbers greater than 1, if all exponents are even, then the number is a square. 

But let me think again. Suppose that a is a product of primes each raised to an even exponent. Then, taking the square root would give me an integer, as I said before. Therefore, a is a square. 

Is there a case where even exponents don't lead to a square? Let me think. Suppose that a number is 2^2 * 3^2, which is 36. Then sqrt(36) is 6. If a number is 2^4 * 3^4, sqrt is 2^2 * 3^2, which is 36. So that works. What if a number is 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2? Then sqrt is 2*3*5=30. So that works. 

But what if there is a prime with exponent zero? Wait, but in the prime factorization, primes with exponent zero are not included. So if all exponents in the prime factorization are even, then each exponent is even and at least 2? No, if a number is 1, but again, a > 1. Wait, but if a number is 2^2, then that's 4. If a number is 2^0 * 3^2, but that would be 3^2 = 9, which is a square. But in the prime factorization, 2^0 is not included. So the exponents in the canonical form are all even. 

Therefore, the logic seems to hold. 

But maybe I need to formalize this more. Let me try to write it in mathematical terms. 

First, suppose that a is a square. Then, there exists an integer b such that a = b². Let the prime factorization of b be b = p₁^e₁ * p₂^e₂ * ... * pₙ^eₙ. Then, squaring b gives a = p₁^(2e₁) * p₂^(2e₂) * ... * pₙ^(2eₙ). Therefore, in the prime factorization of a, each exponent is twice that of b, hence even. Therefore, the exponents in the prime factorization of a are all even. 

Conversely, suppose that a has a prime factorization where all exponents are even. Let me write a as a = p₁^(2k₁) * p₂^(2k₂) * ... * pₙ^(2kₙ). Then, taking the square root of a gives sqrt(a) = p₁^k₁ * p₂^k₂ * ... * pₙ^kₙ. Since each k_i is an integer (because the exponents in the prime factorization are even, so dividing by 2 gives an integer), then sqrt(a) is an integer. Therefore, a is a square. 

Therefore, the two directions are proven. 

But wait, is there any case where even exponents might not lead to a square? Let me think about the case where the exponents are zero. But in the prime factorization, exponents are non-zero for primes that divide the number. So if all exponents are even, then they are even and non-zero? No, if a number is 1, but since a > 1, maybe there's no such case. 

Wait, suppose that a is 1, but the problem states a > 1. So for a > 1, the prime factorization has primes with exponents at least 1. If all exponents are even, then they are at least 2? No, if a number is 2^2, then exponent is 2. If a number is 2^0 * 3^2, but that would be 3^2, which is 9. But in the prime factorization, 2^0 is not included. So the exponents in the prime factorization are all even and at least 2? No, for example, if a number is 3^2, then exponent is 2. If a number is 2^2, exponent is 2. So in general, exponents are even and at least 2? No, if a number is 1, but again, a > 1. 

Wait, but suppose that a number is a square of a prime, like 2² = 4. Then the exponent is 2, which is even. If a number is 2^4, exponent is 4, which is even. So in general, if all exponents are even, then the number is a square. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a case where exponents are zero? But in the prime factorization, exponents are zero only for primes not dividing the number. So if we have a number with prime factors, each exponent is even. For example, take a number like 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^0. But 5^0 is 1, so the number is 2^2 * 3^2 = 36. But in the prime factorization, we don't include primes with exponent zero. Therefore, the exponents in the prime factorization are all even and non-zero. 

Therefore, the logic holds. 

But maybe I should check for some specific examples. Let me take a number that is not a square, say 12. Its prime factorization is 2² * 3¹. The exponent of 3 is 1, which is odd. Therefore, 12 is not a square. If I take 18, which is 2¹ * 3². Again, exponent of 2 is 1, odd, so not a square. If I take 16, which is 2⁴, all exponents even, so it's a square. 25 is 5², which is a square. 

Another example: 36 is 2² * 3², so exponents even. 49 is 7², same thing. 

What about a number with multiple primes? Let's say 2² * 3² * 5² = 900. Square root is 30, which is integer. So that's a square. 

If I have a number with exponents that are even but not multiples of 4? For example, 2² * 3² = 36. Square root is 6. So that's okay. 

So seems like the logic is correct. 

But maybe I need to think about the uniqueness of prime factorization. Since the prime factorization is unique, then if all exponents are even, then the square root is uniquely determined. Therefore, the square root is an integer. 

Another thought: suppose that a is a square, then its prime exponents are even. Conversely, if exponents are even, then a is a square. Therefore, the equivalence is established. 

Is there any possible case where exponents are even, but the number isn't a square? For example, if a number is 1, but again, a > 1. If a number is 2^2 * 3^2, that's 36, which is 6². If a number is 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2, that's 30². So seems like all exponents even implies square. 

Alternatively, think about the definition of a square. A square is a number that is the square of some integer. So if you have a number whose prime exponents are all even, then you can take half of each exponent and multiply them together to get the square root. 

Therefore, the proof seems solid. 

But let me check if there is a case where exponents are even but the number isn't a square. Suppose someone says, what if the number is 1? But 1 is not considered here. If the number is 0? But the problem says a > 1. So no. 

Alternatively, suppose that the exponents are even but the number is not a square. For example, take a number like 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7^2... but that's a square. So no. 

Alternatively, suppose that a number is 2^2 * 3^4. Then sqrt(a) is 2*3² = 2*9=18, which is integer. So that's a square. 

Therefore, I think the proof is correct. 

So the conclusion is that a positive integer a > 1 is a square if and only if in its prime factorization, all exponents are even. Therefore, the statement is proven.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\text{The statement is proven.}}
</think>

To prove that a positive integer $ a > 1 $ is a square if and only if in its canonical (prime) factorization all the exponents of the primes are even integers, we consider the two directions of the biconditional statement.

---

### **1. If $ a $ is a square, then all exponents in its prime factorization are even.**

Suppose $ a = b^2 $ for some integer $ b > 1 $. By the **fundamental theorem of arithmetic**, $ b $ can be written in its prime factorization form as:

$$
b = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_n^{e_n}
$$

Then, squaring both sides:

$$
a = b^2 = p_1^{2e_1} p_2^{2e_2} \cdots p_n^{2e_n}
$$

This shows that in the prime factorization of $ a $, each exponent is twice the exponent in $ b $, hence **even**. Therefore, if $ a $ is a square, then **all exponents in its prime factorization are even**.

---

### **2. If all exponents in the prime factorization of $ a $ are even, then $ a $ is a square.**

Suppose $ a $ has a prime factorization:

$$
a = p_1^{2k_1} p_2^{2k_2} \cdots p_n^{2k_n}
$$

Then, we can define:

$$
b = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \cdots p_n^{k_n}
$$

Squaring $ b $:

$$
b^2 = p_1^{2k_1} p_2^{2k_2} \cdots p_n^{2k_n} = a
$$

Thus, $ a = b^2 $, which means $ a $ is a square. Therefore, if all exponents in the prime factorization of $ a $ are even, then **$ a $ is a square**.

---

### **Conclusion**

The two directions of the biconditional are both established:

- **If $ a $ is a square, then all exponents in its prime factorization are even.**
- **If all exponents in the prime factorization of $ a $ are even, then $ a $ is a square.**

Hence, the statement is proven.
