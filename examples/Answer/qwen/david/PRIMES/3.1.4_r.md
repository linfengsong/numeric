Okay, so I need to show that if p is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, then p squared plus 2 is composite. Hmm, let's start by recalling what a composite number is. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. So, if I can show that p² + 2 has a divisor other than 1 and itself, then it's composite.

First, let me try plugging in some prime numbers greater than or equal to 5 and see what happens. Maybe that will give me an idea.

Take p = 5. Then p² + 2 = 25 + 2 = 27. 27 is 3³, so it's composite. Okay, that works.

Next, p = 7. Then 7² + 2 = 49 + 2 = 51. 51 is 3 × 17, so composite. Good.

p = 11. 11² + 2 = 121 + 2 = 123. 123 is 3 × 41, composite.

p = 13. 13² + 2 = 169 + 2 = 171. 171 is 9 × 19, composite.

Hmm, seems like all these examples are composite. But I need to prove it for any prime p ≥ 5. So, maybe there's a general reason why p² + 2 is composite for primes ≥ 5.

Let me think about modular arithmetic. Maybe I can find a divisor of p² + 2. Since p is a prime ≥ 5, it's odd. Because all primes except 2 are odd, and since p ≥ 5, it's definitely odd.

So p is odd. Then p² is also odd, because odd times odd is odd. Then p² + 2 is odd + even = odd + even = odd? Wait, no. Wait, odd + even is odd. Wait, 2 is even, so odd + even is odd. Wait, but p² is odd, so p² + 2 is odd + even = odd? Wait, that would mean p² + 2 is odd. But then, if p² + 2 is odd, it could be prime or composite. But in our examples, it was composite. However, maybe there's a way to show that it's divisible by some number.

Alternatively, maybe consider modulo 3 or 5 or something. Let me check.

First, let's check modulo 3. Any prime p ≥ 5 can't be divisible by 3, so p ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3.

If p ≡ 1 mod 3, then p² ≡ 1² = 1 mod 3. Then p² + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. So p² + 2 is divisible by 3.

If p ≡ 2 mod 3, then p² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Then p² + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. So again, p² + 2 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, regardless of whether p ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3, p² + 2 is divisible by 3. Therefore, since p ≥ 5, p² + 2 is divisible by 3, and since p² + 2 is at least 5² + 2 = 27, which is greater than 3, so 3 is a proper divisor. Therefore, p² + 2 is composite.

Wait, that seems to work. But let me check with the examples. For p=5: 25 + 2 = 27, which is 3*9. For p=7: 49 + 2 = 51 = 3*17. For p=11: 121 + 2 = 123 = 3*41. For p=13: 169 + 2 = 171 = 3*57. All divisible by 3. So that seems to hold.

But wait, is there a case where p² + 2 equals 3? Well, p² + 2 = 3 implies p² = 1, so p=1, which is not prime. So for primes p ≥ 5, p² + 2 is at least 27, so 3 is a proper divisor. Therefore, p² + 2 is composite. Therefore, the statement is proven.

But wait, let me check if there's a case where p² + 2 is 3 times something, but maybe 3 is not a proper divisor? But since p² + 2 is at least 27, which is 3*9, so 3 is a proper divisor. Therefore, composite.

But hold on, what if p² + 2 is equal to 3? But as I said, p² + 2 = 3 implies p² = 1, which is not prime. So, for p ≥ 5, p² + 2 is definitely composite.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Since p is a prime ≥ 5, it's not divisible by 3. Therefore, p ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3. Then p² ≡ 1 mod 3, so p² + 2 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, 3 divides p² + 2. Since p² + 2 is greater than 3, it's composite. Therefore, done.

So that seems to be the proof. But let me check if there's another possible divisor. For example, maybe modulo 5?

But maybe that's not necessary. Since we already have that 3 divides p² + 2, and since p² + 2 is greater than 3, then it's composite.

But let me check for p=5, p² + 2=27, which is 3^3. For p=7, 51=3*17. For p=11, 123=3*41. For p=13, 171=3*57. So, all of them have 3 as a factor, and since they are larger than 3, they are composite.

Therefore, the conclusion is that p² + 2 is composite for any prime p ≥ 5.

But let me think again. Suppose p is 5. Then p² + 2 is 27, which is composite. If p is 7, 51, composite. So, seems like 3 divides p² + 2 for all primes p ≥ 5. Therefore, since 3 is a prime factor, and p² + 2 is greater than 3, then it is composite.

But why is p² + 2 divisible by 3? Because p is not divisible by 3, so p ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3, and then p² ≡ 1 mod 3, so p² + 2 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, 3 divides p² + 2.

Therefore, the conclusion is that p² + 2 is composite. Therefore, the statement is proven.

But let me check if there's a case where p² + 2 is 3 times 1? But that would require p² + 2 = 3, so p² = 1, which is p=1, not prime. So, no.

Alternatively, maybe p² + 2 is 3 times a prime? Well, for example, 27 is 3*9, which is 3*3², so composite. 51 is 3*17, composite. 123 is 3*41, composite. 171 is 3*57, which is 3*3*19, composite. So, in all cases, composite.

Therefore, the proof is done by showing that p² + 2 is divisible by 3, and since p ≥ 5, p² + 2 is at least 27, so it's composite.

Therefore, the answer is that p² + 2 is composite because it is divisible by 3, which is a prime number less than p² + 2, hence composite.

Wait, but maybe I should formalize this more.

Let me try to write the proof step by step.

Given that p is a prime number with p ≥ 5.

We need to show that p² + 2 is composite.

First, note that p is an odd prime (since all primes ≥ 5 are odd). Therefore, p is odd.

Now, consider modulo 3. Since p is a prime greater than 3, it cannot be divisible by 3. Therefore, p ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3.

Case 1: p ≡ 1 mod 3. Then p² ≡ 1² ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, p² + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 ≡ 0 mod 3.

Case 2: p ≡ 2 mod 3. Then p² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, p² + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 ≡ 0 mod 3.

Therefore, in both cases, p² + 2 ≡ 0 mod 3. Hence, 3 divides p² + 2.

Now, since p ≥ 5, p² + 2 ≥ 5² + 2 = 25 + 2 = 27. Therefore, p² + 2 ≥ 27, which is greater than 3. Hence, 3 is a proper divisor of p² + 2, so p² + 2 is composite.

Therefore, the statement is proven.

Alternatively, another way: Since 3 divides p² + 2 and 3 < p² + 2, then p² + 2 is composite.

Yes, that's the key point. So, the conclusion is that p² + 2 is composite.

Therefore, the answer is shown.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{p^2 + 2 \text{ is composite}}
</think>

To show that for any prime number $ p \geq 5 $, the expression $ p^2 + 2 $ is composite, we proceed with a structured proof using modular arithmetic and properties of prime numbers.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

We are given that $ p $ is a prime number with $ p \geq 5 $, and we need to show that the expression $ p^2 + 2 $ is **composite**. A number is composite if it has a divisor other than 1 and itself.

---

### Step 2: Consider the Modulo 3 Behavior

Since $ p \geq 5 $, and all primes greater than 3 are not divisible by 3, we know that $ p \equiv 1 $ or $ 2 \mod 3 $. Let’s examine both cases:

- **Case 1:** $ p \equiv 1 \mod 3 $  
  Then $ p^2 \equiv 1^2 = 1 \mod 3 $, so  
  $ p^2 + 2 \equiv 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $.

- **Case 2:** $ p \equiv 2 \mod 3 $  
  Then $ p^2 \equiv 2^2 = 4 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $, so  
  $ p^2 + 2 \equiv 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $.

In both cases, $ p^2 + 2 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $, which means that 3 divides $ p^2 + 2 $.

---

### Step 3: Use the Divisibility to Conclude Compositeness

We now know that 3 is a divisor of $ p^2 + 2 $. Since $ p \geq 5 $, we can compute the minimum value of $ p^2 + 2 $:

$$
p^2 + 2 \geq 5^2 + 2 = 25 + 2 = 27
$$

So, $ p^2 + 2 \geq 27 $, and 3 is a proper divisor of $ p^2 + 2 $ (i.e., not equal to $ p^2 + 2 $ itself). Therefore, $ p^2 + 2 $ has a proper divisor other than 1 and itself, which means it is **composite**.

---

### Final Conclusion

We have shown that for any prime $ p \geq 5 $, $ p^2 + 2 $ is divisible by 3, and since $ p^2 + 2 \geq 27 $, it is not a prime number. Hence, it is **composite**.

\boxed{p^2 + 2 \text{ is composite}}
