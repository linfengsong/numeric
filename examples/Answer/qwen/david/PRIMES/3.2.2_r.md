Okay, so I need to find all the prime numbers between 100 and 200 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Hmm, let me recall how that sieve works. From what I remember, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a certain limit. The basic idea is to start with a list of numbers and then systematically eliminate the non-prime numbers by marking their multiples. 

First, I need to figure out how to apply this method between 100 and 200. Wait, the sieve is usually applied to a range starting from 2, but since we need primes between 100 and 200, maybe I can adjust the method accordingly. Let me think. 

The standard sieve starts by creating a list of consecutive integers from 2 up to the maximum number you want to check. Then, starting with the first prime number, 2, you mark all its multiples as non-prime. Then move to the next unmarked number, which is the next prime, and repeat the process. 

But since I need primes between 100 and 200, maybe I can start by creating a list of numbers from 100 to 200. However, I need to remember that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the sieve would start by eliminating numbers that are multiples of primes less than or equal to the square root of 200. Wait, the square root of 200 is approximately 14.14. So, primes up to 13 need to be considered because any composite number less than or equal to 200 must have a factor less than or equal to its square root. Therefore, if I can eliminate all multiples of primes up to 13, the remaining numbers should be primes. 

But since our range starts at 100, maybe I need to adjust the sieve accordingly. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Create a list of all integers from 100 to 200.
2. Identify the primes up to the square root of 200, which is about 14.14. So primes up to 13.
3. For each prime number starting from 2, mark all its multiples within the range 100-200 as non-prime.
4. The numbers that remain unmarked are primes.

But wait, since the sieve is usually applied starting from 2, but our range starts at 100, maybe I need to adjust the starting point. However, the sieve can be applied to any range, but I need to make sure that I don't miss any primes. Let me check if there's a better way.

Alternatively, maybe I can first generate all primes up to 200 using the sieve and then pick those between 100 and 200. But that might be more work. However, since the user specifically wants the Sieve of Eratosthenes applied to get primes between 100 and 200, I should try to do it directly.

But let me think again. If I start with the list from 100 to 200, then the first prime to consider is 2. However, since all even numbers are non-prime (except 2), but since our range starts at 100, which is even, so all even numbers in this range are non-prime. Therefore, I can first eliminate all even numbers. Then, check for multiples of 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc., up to sqrt(200).

But let me try to structure this step by step.

First, list all numbers from 100 to 200. Let me note that 100 is even, so 100 is not prime. Then 101 is a prime. But let me not just list them, but actually apply the sieve.

But maybe it's easier to first generate all primes up to 200 and then filter those between 100 and 200. However, the question says to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes. So perhaps I need to do the sieve up to 200 and then take the primes between 100 and 200. But maybe the user wants the sieve applied directly to the range 100-200. Let me check.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes can be adapted to any range. The standard method is to create a list of numbers from 2 to N, then eliminate multiples. However, if we want to find primes in a specific range, say between 100 and 200, we can create a list from 100 to 200 and then apply the sieve. However, we need to make sure that we consider all primes up to sqrt(200) to eliminate all composites. 

But here's a problem: when you start the sieve from 100, you need to know which primes to eliminate. For example, if you start with 100, you need to eliminate multiples of 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. But since 100 is already even, all even numbers in the range are non-prime. So, first step: eliminate all even numbers. Then, for odd numbers, check for multiples of 3, 5, 7, etc. 

Alternatively, maybe I can do the sieve for numbers up to 200, then take the primes between 100 and 200. Let me try that approach because it might be more straightforward. Let me recall how the standard sieve works.

The standard Sieve of Eratosthenes steps:

1. Create a list of all integers from 2 to N (in this case, 200).
2. Start with the first prime number, 2. Mark all multiples of 2 as non-prime.
3. Move to the next unmarked number, which is 3. Mark all multiples of 3 as non-prime.
4. Continue this process until you've processed all primes up to sqrt(N). The remaining unmarked numbers are primes.

So, if I do this for N=200, then the primes between 100 and 200 would be the ones that are left after applying the sieve. Therefore, maybe I can do that. However, since the user says "employing the Sieve of Eratosthenes, obtain all the primes between 100 and 200", maybe they want the sieve applied directly to that range. But I think either way is acceptable, but perhaps the standard way is to do the sieve up to 200 and then take the primes between 100 and 200. 

But let me try to do it step by step for the range 100-200. Let me think. 

First, create a list of numbers from 100 to 200. Let me note that 100 is even, so it's not prime. Then 101 is prime, 102 is even, 103 is prime, etc. However, to apply the sieve properly, I need to eliminate multiples of primes. But since the sieve starts with 2, which is the smallest prime, I need to eliminate all multiples of 2 in the range. 

So, first, eliminate all even numbers. So numbers like 100, 102, 104,..., 200. Then, the remaining numbers are odd numbers from 101 to 199. Then, next, eliminate multiples of 3. But wait, but in the sieve, after eliminating multiples of 2, we move to the next prime, which is 3. However, since we have already eliminated all multiples of 2, the next step is to eliminate multiples of 3. However, we need to check which multiples of 3 are in the range. 

But maybe I need to think of the sieve as starting from 2, then 3, then 5, etc., up to sqrt(200). 

Alternatively, since we are only interested in numbers between 100 and 200, maybe we can optimize the sieve by only considering primes up to sqrt(200) â‰ˆ14.14. So primes up to 13. 

Therefore, the primes to consider for elimination are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. 

So, here's the plan:

1. Start with numbers from 100 to 200.
2. Eliminate all multiples of 2 (even numbers).
3. Eliminate all multiples of 3 that are not already eliminated.
4. Eliminate all multiples of 5 that are not already eliminated.
5. Eliminate all multiples of 7 that are not already eliminated.
6. Eliminate all multiples of 11 that are not already eliminated.
7. Eliminate all multiples of 13 that are not already eliminated.
8. The remaining numbers are primes between 100 and 200.

But let me verify this. For example, if a number is composite, it must have a factor less than or equal to its square root. Since we are eliminating all multiples of primes up to 13, which is less than sqrt(200), then any composite number in the range would have been eliminated. Therefore, the remaining numbers are primes. 

But let me check with an example. Take 121, which is 11 squared. Since 11 is one of the primes we are considering, so 121 would be eliminated as a multiple of 11. Similarly, 169 is 13 squared, which would be eliminated as a multiple of 13. So that seems correct.

So, now I need to perform these steps. However, since this is a thought process, I need to simulate this step by step. However, doing this manually for all numbers from 100 to 200 would be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a systematic way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can list all the primes between 100 and 200 by knowing that they are primes. But the user wants the sieve method. So, let me try to proceed.

First, let me note that the numbers from 100 to 200 include both even and odd numbers. First, eliminate all even numbers. So, starting from 100, which is even, then 102, 104,..., 200. All these numbers are non-prime (except 2, but 2 is not in the range). So, after eliminating even numbers, the remaining numbers are odd numbers from 101 to 199.

Now, the next prime is 3. So, we need to eliminate all multiples of 3 in the remaining numbers. However, note that some of these numbers might have already been eliminated as multiples of 2. But since we are only considering odd numbers, we need to check which of these are multiples of 3.

Similarly, for 5, 7, etc.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the sieve as follows:

Start with the list of numbers from 100 to 200.

First, remove all multiples of 2. Then, remove all multiples of 3, then 5, then 7, then 11, then 13. After that, the remaining numbers are primes.

But how do I do that step by step?

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:

Start with the list of numbers from 100 to 200.

For each prime p (starting from 2 up to sqrt(200)), mark all multiples of p in the list as non-prime.

But since we already eliminated even numbers, maybe we can skip even primes? Wait, no, the sieve needs to consider all primes. So, even though we have already eliminated all multiples of 2, we still need to eliminate multiples of 3, 5, 7, etc.

But let's think about the first step: eliminate multiples of 2. So, numbers like 100, 102,..., 200 are eliminated. Then, for multiples of 3: starting from 102 (which is already eliminated), then 105, 108,..., 198. However, 105 is 3*35, which is in the range. But 105 is odd, so it's not eliminated yet. So, we need to eliminate 105, 111, 117,..., up to 195.

Similarly, for 5: multiples of 5 in the range. But since we have already eliminated even numbers, the multiples of 5 that are odd would be 105, 115, 125,..., 195. However, some of these may have already been eliminated as multiples of 3 or 2. But since we are applying the sieve step by step, we need to eliminate them.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a way to list the primes between 100 and 200. However, since I need to do this step by step, maybe I can use the fact that primes between 100 and 200 are known, but I need to simulate the sieve process.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the standard sieve up to 200 and then pick the primes between 100 and 200. Let me try that approach.

First, create a list of numbers from 2 to 200. Then, starting with 2, mark all multiples of 2. Then 3, mark multiples of 3, etc. After completing the sieve, the primes between 100 and 200 would be the ones left.

But since I can't actually write down all the numbers here, maybe I can recall that the primes between 100 and 200 are:

101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199.

Wait, but I need to verify this. However, since I need to use the sieve, maybe I should simulate the sieve steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the primes between 100 and 200 as follows:

Start with numbers from 100 to 200. First, eliminate even numbers. Then, eliminate multiples of 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.

Let me try to do this step by step.

First, eliminate even numbers:

Numbers from 100 to 200:

100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200.

After eliminating even numbers, we remove all numbers divisible by 2. So, the remaining numbers are the odd numbers:

101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199.

Now, the next prime is 3. We need to eliminate multiples of 3. Let's find which of the remaining numbers are multiples of 3. 

Multiples of 3 in the range 100-200 are 102, 105, 108,..., 198. However, we have already eliminated even numbers, so the remaining multiples of 3 are the odd multiples of 3. Let's check:

Starting from 105 (which is 3*35), then 111 (3*37), 117 (3*39), 123 (3*41), 129 (3*43), 135 (3*45), 141 (3*47), 147 (3*49), 153 (3*51), 159 (3*53), 165 (3*55), 171 (3*57), 177 (3*59), 183 (3*61), 189 (3*63), 195 (3*65).

So, these numbers need to be eliminated. Let's remove them from the list:

After removing multiples of 3, the list becomes:

101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 115, 119, 121, 127, 131, 133, 137, 139, 143, 145, 149, 151, 157, 161, 163, 167, 169, 173, 175, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199.

Wait, let me check. For example, 105 was removed, 107 is left, 109 is left, 111 removed, 113 left, 115 left, 117 removed, 119 left, 121 left, 123 removed, 125 left, 127 left, 129 removed, 131 left, 133 left, 135 removed, 137 left, 139 left, 141 removed, 143 left, 145 left, 147 removed, 149 left, 151 left, 153 removed, 155 left, 157 left, 159 removed, 161 left, 163 left, 165 removed, 167 left, 169 left, 171 removed, 173 left, 175 left, 177 removed, 179 left, 181 left, 183 removed, 185 left, 187 left, 189 removed, 191 left, 193 left, 195 removed, 197 left, 199 left.

So, that seems correct.

Next prime is 5. Now, eliminate multiples of 5 from the remaining list. Multiples of 5 in the range 100-200 that are not even (since we already eliminated even numbers) are 105, 115, 125, 135, 145, 155, 165, 175, 185, 195. However, some of these may have already been eliminated as multiples of 3. For example, 105 was eliminated in the previous step (multiple of 3 and 5). Similarly, 115 is 5*23, which hasn't been eliminated yet. Let me check which of the remaining numbers are multiples of 5.

Looking at the current list:

101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 115, 119, 121, 127, 131, 133, 137, 139, 143, 145, 149, 151, 157, 161, 163, 167, 169, 173, 175, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199.

Multiples of 5 here are 115, 125 (not in the list?), wait, 125 is 5*25. Wait, in the current list, is 125 present? Let me check. After eliminating multiples of 3, 125 was not eliminated yet? Wait, 125 is 5^3. Let me check if 125 is in the list. The numbers after eliminating multiples of 3 include 125? Yes, because 125 is not a multiple of 3. So, 125 is in the list. Similarly, 145, 155, 175, 185, 195.

So, need to eliminate 115, 125, 145, 155, 175, 185, 195.

So removing these from the list:

After removing multiples of 5:

101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 119, 121, 127, 131, 133, 137, 139, 143, 149, 151, 157, 161, 163, 167, 169, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199.

Wait, let me check each:

- 115 is removed.
- 125 is removed.
- 145 is removed.
- 155 is removed.
- 175 is removed.
- 185 is removed.
- 195 is removed.

So, the remaining numbers are as above.

Next prime is 7. Now, eliminate multiples of 7. Let's find which numbers in the current list are multiples of 7. 

Multiples of 7 in the range 100-200 are 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196. However, we have already eliminated even numbers, so the odd multiples of 7 are 119, 133, 147, 155? Wait, no, 155 is not a multiple of 7. Let me check:

Looking at the current list:

Numbers are: 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 119, 121, 127, 131, 133, 137, 139, 143, 149, 151, 157, 161, 163, 167, 169, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199.

Now, check which of these are multiples of 7:

- 119: 7*17 = 119. Yes.
- 133: 7*19 = 133. Yes.
- 147: 7*21 = 147. But 147 was removed earlier when we eliminated multiples of 3 (since 147 is 3*49). Wait, but in the current list, 147 was already removed? Wait, no. Wait, after eliminating multiples of 3, 147 was removed. Wait, let me check the current list. In the current list after removing multiples of 5, we have 143, 149, etc. Wait, 147 was removed when we eliminated multiples of 3. So, in the current list, 147 is not present. So, maybe 147 is already gone. Therefore, in the current list, the multiples of 7 are 119, 133, and maybe others?

Check 161: 7*23 = 161. Yes, 161 is in the current list. Similarly, 175 was removed earlier (as multiple of 5). 189 is 7*27, but 189 was removed when we eliminated multiples of 3 (since 189 is 3*63). So, 189 is not in the current list. 196 is even, so already removed. So, in the current list, the multiples of 7 are 119, 133, 161.

Therefore, we need to eliminate 119, 133, 161.

So, removing those from the list:

After removing multiples of 7:

101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 121, 127, 131, 137, 139, 143, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 169, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199.

Now, next prime is 11. Eliminate multiples of 11. Let's find multiples of 11 in the current list.

Multiples of 11 between 100 and 200 are 110, 121, 132, 143, 154, 165, 176, 187, 198. However, we have already eliminated even numbers, so the odd multiples are 121, 143, 165, 187. 

Check if these are in the current list:

- 121: yes, in the current list.
- 143: yes, in the current list.
- 165: was it eliminated? 165 is 3*55, so it was eliminated when we removed multiples of 3. So, 165 is not in the current list.
- 187: 11*17 = 187. Is 187 in the current list? Yes, 187 is in the list.

So, need to eliminate 121, 143, 187.

So, removing them:

After removing multiples of 11:

101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 169, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199.

Next prime is 13. Eliminate multiples of 13. Let's find multiples of 13 in the current list.

Multiples of 13 between 100 and 200 are 104, 117, 130, 143, 156, 169, 182, 195. Again, considering odd multiples (since even numbers are already eliminated):

117 (13*9), 143 (13*11), 169 (13*13), 182 (even, already eliminated), 195 (13*15). 

Check if these are in the current list:

- 117: was it eliminated? 117 is 3*39, so it was eliminated when we removed multiples of 3. So, not in the current list.
- 143: was it eliminated? Yes, in the previous step when we removed multiples of 11. So, 143 is already removed.
- 169: 13*13. Is 169 in the current list? Yes, 169 is in the list.
- 195: was it eliminated? 195 is 3*65, so it was eliminated when we removed multiples of 3. So, not in the current list.

Therefore, only 169 needs to be eliminated.

So, remove 169:

After removing multiples of 13:

101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199.

Now, the next prime after 13 is 17. However, the square root of 200 is approximately 14.14, so primes up to 13 are sufficient. Therefore, we don't need to consider primes larger than 13 because any composite number in the range would have a factor less than or equal to 13. Therefore, we can stop here.

Therefore, the remaining numbers are primes between 100 and 200.

Let me list them:

101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199.

Wait, let me check if there are any numbers missing. For example, 127 is there, 131, 137, etc. Let me check if 113 is there. Yes. 127, yes. 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199. 

But let me check if there are any other numbers. For example, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113. Then after that, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199. 

Wait, but what about 113? Yes, it's there. 113 is in the list. Let me check if all of these are primes.

101: prime.

103: prime.

107: prime.

109: prime.

113: prime.

127: prime.

131: prime.

137: prime.

139: prime.

149: prime.

173: prime.

179: prime.

181: prime.

191: prime.

197: prime.

199: prime.

Yes, all of these are primes. So, that seems correct.

But let me check if there are any numbers that were not eliminated. For example, let's check 127. 127 is a prime. 127 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Let me check:

Divisible by 2? No. 3? 1+2+7=10, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7, no. 7? 7*18=126, 127-126=1, not divisible by 7. 11? 11*11=121, 11*12=132, so no. 13? 13*9=117, 13*10=130, so no. So yes, 127 is prime.

Similarly, 137: check divisibility. 137 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. 13*10=130, 13*11=143, so no. So yes.

Another check: 149. 149 is prime. 149 divided by 2, no. 3? 1+4+9=14, not divisible by 3. 5? No. 7? 7*21=147, 149-147=2, not divisible by 7. 11? 11*13=143, 11*14=154, so no. 13? 13*11=143, 13*12=156, so no. So yes.

Another check: 151. Divisible by 2? No. 3? 1+5+1=7, no. 5? No. 7? 7*21=147, 151-147=4, no. 11? 11*13=143, 11*14=154, no. 13? 13*11=143, 13*12=156, no. So yes.

Similarly, 157. Divisible by 2? No. 3? 1+5+7=13, no. 5? No. 7? 7*22=154, 157-154=3, no. 11? 11*14=154, 11*15=165, no. 13? 13*12=156, 13*13=169, no. So yes.

So, all these numbers are primes.

Therefore, the primes between 100 and 200 are:

101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199.

Let me check if there are any other primes in that range. For example, 113 is there. What about 127, 131, etc. Let me check 173: yes, 173 is prime. 179, yes. 181, yes. 191, 193, 197, 199. 

Wait, but what about 113? Yes, it's included. Also, 101, 103, 107, 109. 

But let me check if there are any numbers between 100 and 200 that are primes that I might have missed. For example, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199. That seems to be 21 primes. Let me count:

1. 101
2. 103
3. 107
4. 109
5. 113
6. 127
7. 131
8. 137
9. 139
10. 149
11. 151
12. 157
13. 163
14. 167
15. 173
16. 179
17. 181
18. 191
19. 193
20. 197
21. 199

Yes, that's 21 primes. Let me check online or recall if that's correct. Wait, I can't actually check, but based on the sieve steps above, this seems correct. 

Therefore, the primes between 100 and 200 are the ones listed above.

**Final Answer**
The primes between 100 and 200 are \boxed{101}, \boxed{103}, \boxed{107}, \boxed{109}, \boxed{113}, \boxed{127}, \boxed{131}, \boxed{137}, \boxed{139}, \boxed{149}, \boxed{151}, \boxed{157}, \boxed{163}, \boxed{167}, \boxed{173}, \boxed{179}, \boxed{181}, \boxed{191}, \boxed{193}, \boxed{197}, and \boxed{199}.

But since the problem says "obtain all the primes between 100 and 200," and the user might expect a single boxed list. However, typically, for multiple answers, they might expect them listed in a single box separated by commas. However, the standard practice here is to list them as individual boxed numbers. But since the user might expect a list, maybe as a single box with all primes. However, the original instructions say "put your final answer within \boxed{}". So perhaps they want all primes in a single box, separated by commas.

But looking at the problem again: "obtain all the primes between 100 and 200." So, the answer is a list of primes. However, the platform might require each prime in its own box, but the user instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Maybe the user expects a list inside a single box. 

But in standard practice for such problems, when multiple answers are expected, they are listed in a single box separated by commas. For example, on some platforms, the answer is written as \boxed{101}, \boxed{103}, etc. However, given that the user might have different expectations, but since the original question says "obtain all the primes", I think the correct way is to list them all in a single box, separated by commas. However, I need to check if that's acceptable. Alternatively, if the system requires each prime in its own box, but the user instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", which is singular. Therefore, perhaps the answer should be a list of primes in a single box.

But looking at the problem statement, the user might expect the primes listed in order, boxed. However, since I can't be sure, but given that in many cases, multiple primes are listed in a single box separated by commas, I think that's acceptable. However, to comply with the instruction, maybe I should present them as individual boxed numbers. But the user instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", which is singular. Therefore, perhaps the answer should be a list inside a single box. 

But looking at examples on the internet, for multiple answers, sometimes they are separated by commas inside a single box. For example:

\boxed{101}, \boxed{103}, ..., \boxed{199}

But since the user might have different expectations, but given that the original instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", and there are multiple answers, maybe the correct approach is to list them all in one box. However, I need to check the exact problem's expectation. Since the user hasn't specified, but in the problem statement, they say "obtain all the primes between 100 and 200", which is a list, and in the context of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, the answer is a list of primes. Therefore, I will present them in a single box, separated by commas.

But let me check if that's the standard here. In many math problems, when multiple answers are required, they are presented in a single box separated by commas. For example, in the case of multiple primes, it's common to list them all in one box. So I will proceed with that.
