Okay, so I need to find the prime factorization of 1234, 10140, and 36000. Hmm, prime factorization means breaking down each number into its prime number components, right? Let me start with 1234. 

First, I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, to factorize 1234, I should start by checking if it's even. Let me see: 1234 ends with a 4, which is even, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide 1234 by 2. 

1234 divided by 2 is 617. So, 1234 = 2 × 617. Now, I need to check if 617 is a prime number. To do that, I should try dividing it by primes up to its square root. Let me calculate the square root of 617. Well, 25 squared is 625, so the square root of 617 is a bit less than 25, maybe around 24.8. So I need to check primes up to 23. 

Let me start with 3: 6 + 1 + 7 = 14, which isn't divisible by 3, so 617 isn't divisible by 3. Next, 5: it doesn't end with 0 or 5, so no. Then 7: Let me do 617 divided by 7. 7*88 is 616, so 617 - 616 is 1, so remainder 1. Not divisible by 7. Next prime is 11: Let me do the divisibility test for 11. Subtract and add digits alternately: 6 - 1 + 7 = 12. 12 isn't divisible by 11, so no. Next prime is 13: Let me divide 617 by 13. 13*47 is 611, 617 - 611 is 6, so remainder 6. Not divisible by 13. Next prime is 17: 17*36 is 612, 617 - 612 is 5, so remainder 5. Not divisible by 17. Next prime is 19: 19*32 is 608, 617 - 608 is 9, so remainder 9. Not divisible by 19. Next prime is 23: 23*26 is 598, 23*27 is 621, which is more than 617. So 23*26 = 598, 617 - 598 = 19. Not divisible by 23. 

So since none of these primes divide 617, it must be a prime number. Therefore, the prime factorization of 1234 is 2 × 617. Let me check that again. 2 × 617 is indeed 1234. Okay, that seems right.

Now moving on to 10140. Let me start by breaking it down. First, check if it's even. 10140 ends with a 0, so yes, divisible by 10. But 10 is 2 × 5, so maybe I can start by dividing by 2 and 5. Alternatively, let's do step by step.

First, divide by 2: 10140 ÷ 2 = 5070. Then divide by 2 again: 5070 ÷ 2 = 2535. Now 2535 is not even. Next, check divisibility by 5: it ends with 5, so divide by 5: 2535 ÷ 5 = 507. Now, 507. Let me check if this is divisible by 3: 5 + 0 + 7 = 12, which is divisible by 3. So 507 ÷ 3 = 169. Now, 169. Hmm, 13 squared is 169, right? 13 × 13 = 169. So that's a prime number. 

So putting it all together: 10140 = 2 × 2 × 5 × 3 × 13 × 13. Let me write that with exponents: 2² × 3 × 5 × 13². Let me check if that's correct. Let me multiply them step by step. 2² is 4, 4 × 3 is 12, 12 × 5 is 60, 60 × 13 is 780, 780 × 13 is 10140. Yes, that's correct. So that's the prime factorization for 10140.

Now, moving on to 36000. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me think. 36000. First, note that 36000 is 36 × 1000. 36 is 6², which is 2² × 3². 1000 is 10³, which is (2 × 5)³ = 2³ × 5³. So combining those, 36000 = 2² × 3² × 2³ × 5³. Then combining like terms: 2^(2+3) × 3² × 5³ = 2^5 × 3² × 5³. Let me check that. 2^5 is 32, 3² is 9, 5³ is 125. 32 × 9 = 288, 288 × 125. Let me compute that. 288 × 100 = 28800, 288 × 25 = 7200, so total is 28800 + 7200 = 36000. Perfect. So that's correct. 

Alternatively, I could have done it step by step. Let me try that method to verify. Starting with 36000. Divide by 2: 36000 ÷ 2 = 18000. Again by 2: 9000. Again by 2: 4500. Again by 2: 2250. Again by 2: 1125. So that's 2^5. Now 1125. Divide by 5: 1125 ÷ 5 = 225. Again by 5: 45. Again by 5: 9. So that's 5^3. Then 9 is 3². So altogether, 2^5 × 5³ × 3². Yep, same result. So that's correct.

So summarizing:

1234 = 2 × 617

10140 = 2² × 3 × 5 × 13²

36000 = 2^5 × 3² × 5³

Wait, let me just check if 617 is indeed prime. Maybe I should check again. Let me try dividing 617 by some primes. Let me check 7 again: 7*88 is 616, so 617-616=1. Not divisible by 7. 11: 11*56 is 616, 617-616=1. Not divisible by 11. 13: 13*47 is 611, 617-611=6. Not divisible by 13. 17: 17*36=612, 617-612=5. Not divisible by 17. 19: 19*32=608, 617-608=9. Not divisible by 19. 23: 23*26=598, 23*27=621, which is more than 617. So 617 is prime. So that's correct.

Another check for 10140: 2² × 3 × 5 × 13². Let me compute 2² is 4, 4 × 3 is 12, 12 × 5 is 60, 60 × 13 is 780, 780 × 13 is 10140. Correct.

For 36000, as I did before, 2^5 is 32, 3² is 9, 5³ is 125. 32 × 9 = 288, 288 × 125. Let me compute 288 × 100 = 28800, 288 × 25 = 7200, so 28800 + 7200 = 36000. Correct.

So all three factorizations seem correct. Therefore, the answers are as above.

**Final Answer**
The prime factorizations are:
- 1234: $\boxed{2 \times 617}$
- 10140: $\boxed{2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 13^2}$
- 36000: $\boxed{2^5 \times 3^2 \times 5^3}$

To find the **prime factorization** of the integers **1234**, **10140**, and **36000**, we proceed step-by-step, breaking each number down into its prime components.

### **1. Prime Factorization of 1234**

Start by checking divisibility by the smallest primes:

- 1234 is even, so divisible by 2:
  $$
  1234 \div 2 = 617
  $$
- Now check if 617 is prime.

To verify that 617 is prime, we check divisibility by all primes up to $\sqrt{617} \approx 24.8$. The primes less than or equal to 24 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.

- 617 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23.
- Therefore, **617 is a prime number**.

So the prime factorization of 1234 is:
$$
\boxed{2 \times 617}
$$

### **2. Prime Factorization of 10140**

Start by dividing by small primes:

- 10140 is even, so divide by 2:
  $$
  10140 \div 2 = 5070
  $$
- Again divide by 2:
  $$
  5070 \div 2 = 2535
  $$
- 2535 ends in 5, so divide by 5:
  $$
  2535 \div 5 = 507
  $$
- 507 is divisible by 3 (5 + 0 + 7 = 12, which is divisible by 3):
  $$
  507 \div 3 = 169
  $$
- 169 is $13^2$, a known perfect square.

So the factorization is:
$$
2 \times 2 \times 5 \times 3 \times 13 \times 13 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 13^2
$$

Thus, the prime factorization is:
$$
\boxed{2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 13^2}
$$

### **3. Prime Factorization of 36000**

Start by recognizing that:
$$
36000 = 36 \times 1000 = (6^2) \times (10^3)
$$
Now express each in prime factors:
- $6^2 = (2 \times 3)^2 = 2^2 \times 3^2$
- $10^3 = (2 \times 5)^3 = 2^3 \times 5^3$

Combine:
$$
36000 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 2^3 \times 5^3 = 2^{2+3} \times 3^2 \times 5^3 = 2^5 \times 3^2 \times 5^3
$$

Thus, the prime factorization is:
$$
\boxed{2^5 \times 3^2 \times 5^3}
$$

### **Final Answers**

- **1234**: $\boxed{2 \times 617}$
- **10140**: $\boxed{2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 13^2}$
- **36000**: $\boxed{2^5 \times 3^2 \times 5^3}$
