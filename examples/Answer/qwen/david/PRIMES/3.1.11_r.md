Okay, so I need to solve this problem about primes that are one less than a power of 2. The question has two parts: part (a) asks to find four more primes of that form, and part (b) wants me to show that if p = 2^k - 1 is prime, then k must be odd except when k=2. Let me start with part (a).

First, let me recall what the problem says. These primes are of the form 2^k - 1. These are called Mersenne primes, right? Wait, but not all Mersenne numbers are primes. A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two. So, the question is talking about primes that are 1 less than a power of 2, which are called Mersenne primes. However, it's mentioned that this is a conjecture, meaning that it's not proven yet whether there are infinitely many such primes. But for part (a), I just need to find four more examples. The example given is 3 = 2^2 - 1. So, 3 is a Mersenne prime. Let me check the known Mersenne primes.

I remember that the first few Mersenne primes are for exponents 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, etc. Wait, so maybe I need to check for exponents where 2^k - 1 is prime. Let me list some exponents and compute 2^k - 1 to see which are prime.

Starting with k=2: 2^2 -1 = 4 -1 = 3, which is prime. That's the example given.

k=3: 8 -1 = 7, prime. So 7 is another one.

k=4: 16 -1 = 15, which is 3*5, not prime.

k=5: 32 -1 = 31, prime. So 31 is another.

k=6: 64 -1 = 63, which is 7*9, not prime.

k=7: 128 -1 = 127, prime. So 127 is another.

k=8: 256 -1 = 255, which is 3*5*17, not prime.

k=9: 512 -1 = 511. Let me check if that's prime. Hmm, 511 divided by 7 is 73, because 7*73 is 511? Wait, 7*70 is 490, plus 7*3 is 21, so 490+21=511. Yes, so 511 is 7*73, not prime.

k=10: 1024 -1 = 1023. 1023 divided by 3 is 341, which is 11*31. So 1023 is 3*11*31, not prime.

k=11: 2048 -1 = 2047. Hmm, is that prime? Wait, 2047. Let me check. 2047 divided by 23 is... 23*89 is 2047? Let me compute 23*80 = 1840, 23*9 = 207, so 1840 + 207 = 2047. Yes, so 2047 is 23*89, not prime.

k=12: 4096 -1 = 4095, which is divisible by 5, since it ends with 5. 4095 / 5 = 819, so not prime.

k=13: 8192 -1 = 8191. Is that prime? Hmm. I think 8191 is a known Mersenne prime. Let me check. Yes, 8191 is a prime. So that's another one.

k=14: 16384 -1 = 16383. Let me check divisibility. 16383 divided by 3 is 5461. So 3*5461 = 16383. Not prime.

k=15: 32768 -1 = 32767. Let me check if that's prime. Hmm. 32767 divided by 7? 7*4681 is 32767? Let me check 7*4680 = 32760, plus 7 is 32767. So yes, 7*4681. Therefore, not prime.

k=16: 65536 -1 = 65535. Divisible by 5, ends with 5. Not prime.

k=17: 131072 -1 = 131071. Is that prime? I think that's a Mersenne prime. Let me confirm. Yes, 131071 is a known Mersenne prime. So that's another one.

k=18: 262144 -1 = 262143. Divided by 3: 2+6+2+1+4+3 = 18, which is divisible by 3, so 262143 is divisible by 3. Not prime.

k=19: 524288 -1 = 524287. Is that prime? I think that's another Mersenne prime. Let me check. Yes, 524287 is a prime. So that's another one.

So, from k=2 up to k=19, the primes are at k=2,3,5,7,13,17,19. So, the example given is k=2 (3), and then the others are k=3 (7), k=5 (31), k=7 (127), k=13 (8191), k=17 (131071), k=19 (524287). So, the problem says to find four more. The example given is 3, so maybe they want four more primes beyond that? Let me check.

The original example is 3 = 2^2 -1. Then the next ones are 7 (k=3), 31 (k=5), 127 (k=7), 8191 (k=13), 131071 (k=17), 524287 (k=19). So, if we need four more, then maybe 7, 31, 127, 8191? But the problem says "four more of these primes", so maybe they want four primes beyond the example given. Wait, the example is 3, so maybe the four more would be 7, 31, 127, 8191? Or maybe they want four more in addition to the example? Wait, the problem says "another unproven conjecture is that there are an infinitude of primes that are 1 less than a power of 2, such as 3 = 2^2 -1. (a) Find four more of these primes."

So, the example is 3, so they want four more primes of that form. So, the four more would be 7, 31, 127, 8191. Let me check if those are primes. 7 is prime, 31 is prime, 127 is prime, 8191 is prime. So, that's four more. But maybe they want the next four after 3? So, 7, 31, 127, 8191. Alternatively, maybe they want four more in total, so including 3? But the example is given as 3, so maybe they want four more, so 7, 31, 127, 8191. Alternatively, maybe they want four more beyond that? Let me check the problem again.

The problem says "another unproven conjecture is that there are an infinitude of primes that are 1 less than a power of 2, such as 3 = 2^2 -1. (a) Find four more of these primes." So, "such as" gives one example, so they want four more. Therefore, the answer would be 7, 31, 127, 8191. But maybe they want the next four after 3? Let me check the list again.

The exponents for Mersenne primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, etc. So, the first few are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, etc. So, if the example is 3 (k=2), then the four more would be 7 (k=3), 31 (k=5), 127 (k=7), 8191 (k=13). So that's four more. Alternatively, maybe they want the next four after 3, which would be 7, 31, 127, 8191. So, that's four primes. So, I think that's the answer for part (a). Let me check if these numbers are indeed primes.

7 is prime. 31 is prime. 127 is prime. 8191 is prime. Yes. So, that's four more. So, part (a) answer is 7, 31, 127, 8191. But maybe they want them in the form of 2^k -1? The question says "Find four more of these primes." So, the primes are 7, 31, 127, 8191. Alternatively, they might want the exponents? But the question says "primes", so the actual primes. So, the answer is 7, 31, 127, 8191.

But let me check if there are more between k=7 and k=13. For example, k=11: 2^11 -1 = 2047, which is 23*89, not prime. k=12: 4095, not prime. k=13: 8191, which is prime. So, yes, between k=7 and k=13, there's no other prime. So, the four more primes after 3 are 7, 31, 127, 8191. So, that's part (a).

Now, moving on to part (b): If p = 2^k - 1 is prime, show that k is an odd integer, except when k = 2.

So, need to show that if p is prime, then k must be odd, except when k=2. So, first, note that when k=2, 2^2 -1 = 3, which is prime. So, that's the exception. For other primes, k must be odd.

So, how to show that? Let me think. Let's suppose that p = 2^k - 1 is prime. Then, we need to show that k must be odd, except when k=2. So, first, maybe consider the case when k is even. Suppose k is even, say k = 2m. Then, 2^k -1 = (2^m)^2 - 1 = (2^m - 1)(2^m + 1). Therefore, if k is even and greater than 2, then 2^k -1 factors into two integers greater than 1, so it's composite. Therefore, if k is even and greater than 2, then 2^k -1 is composite. Therefore, if p = 2^k -1 is prime, then k cannot be even and greater than 2. Therefore, k must be odd or k=2. Therefore, the conclusion is that k is odd except when k=2.

But wait, let me check. If k is even, then k=2m. If m=1, then k=2, which is allowed. So, when m=1, k=2, and 2^2 -1=3 is prime. So, that's the exception. If m>1, then k=2m>2, and then 2^k -1 factors into (2^m -1)(2^m +1), so composite. Therefore, the only even k that can give a prime is k=2.

Therefore, the conclusion is that if p=2^k -1 is prime, then k must be odd, except when k=2.

So, that seems straightforward. But let me check if there are any other cases. For example, if k is 1: 2^1 -1 =1, which is not prime. So, k=1 is not considered. So, the only even k that can produce a prime is k=2. Therefore, for all other primes, k must be odd.

Therefore, the proof is as follows: Suppose p = 2^k -1 is prime. If k is even, then k = 2m for some integer m ≥ 1. Then, 2^k -1 = (2^m)^2 -1 = (2^m -1)(2^m +1). If m ≥ 2, then both 2^m -1 and 2^m +1 are integers greater than 1, so their product is composite. Therefore, p cannot be prime. Therefore, the only even k for which 2^k -1 is prime is k=2. Hence, if p is prime, then k must be odd, except when k=2.

Therefore, that's the proof. Let me check if there's any other case. For example, if k is 0? 2^0 -1 = 0, not prime. k=1: 1, not prime. So, only k=2 is even and gives a prime. So, that's the reasoning.

Therefore, part (b) is shown.

So, to recap:

(a) The four more primes are 7, 31, 127, 8191.

(b) If p = 2^k -1 is prime, then k must be odd except when k=2.

Wait, but maybe I should check if there are any other exponents where k is even and gives a prime. For example, k=2 is the only even exponent. For example, k=4: 15, not prime. k=6: 63, not prime. k=8: 255, not prime. So, yes, only k=2. Therefore, the proof is correct.

So, the answer for part (a) is 7, 31, 127, 8191. But let me check if these are indeed primes.

7 is prime. 31 is prime. 127 is prime. 8191 is prime. Yes. 8191 is a known Mersenne prime. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the exponents? But the question says "primes", so the actual primes. So, 7, 31, 127, 8191.

Alternatively, maybe they want the exponents? But the problem says "Find four more of these primes." So, primes, not exponents. So, the answer is those four numbers.

Therefore, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**

(a) The four more primes are \boxed{7}, \boxed{31}, \boxed{127}, and \boxed{8191}.

(b) The proof is as follows: If $ p = 2^k - 1 $ is prime, then $ k $ must be odd, except when $ k = 2 $. This is because if $ k $ is even and greater than 2, $ 2^k - 1 $ can be factored into $ (2^m - 1)(2^m + 1) $, making it composite. Therefore, $ k $ must be odd or $ k = 2 $.

However, since the question asks for the final answer in boxed format for part (a), and part (b) is a proof, I need to check if the instructions require boxed answers for both parts. But the original problem says:

"(a) Find four more of these primes.

(b) If p = 2^k - 1 is prime, show that k is an odd integer, except when k = 2."

Since part (a) asks to find four primes, and part (b) is a proof, but the user instruction says to put the final answer within \boxed{}.

But in the problem statement, part (a) is to find four more primes, so likely the answer is four numbers. However, the standard practice for multiple answers is to box each one. But maybe the user expects multiple boxed answers. However, in the original problem, part (a) is a list, so perhaps the answer should be four boxed numbers. But since the user hasn't specified, but in the initial problem, part (a) is to "Find four more of these primes," so maybe the answer is four primes, each boxed. However, in the context of the platform, maybe the user expects each answer in a separate box. However, the original instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". So, maybe for part (a), list them as four boxed numbers. However, in the problem statement, the user might expect that part (a) is answered with four primes, so I need to check.

But looking back, the original problem says:

(a) Find four more of these primes.

(b) If p = 2^k - 1 is prime, show that k is an odd integer, except when k = 2.

But in the instructions, the user says: "put your final answer within \boxed{}". So, maybe for part (a), the answer is four primes, so boxed individually. But since the user might expect multiple boxed answers, but in the context of the platform, perhaps they want the four primes listed in boxes. However, in the original problem, the example is 3 = 2^2 -1. So, the four more primes are 7, 31, 127, 8191. So, the answer for (a) is these four numbers. But how to present them? Maybe as four boxed numbers. However, the standard practice in math problems is to have one box per answer. But since the user hasn't specified, but given that part (a) is multiple answers, perhaps I need to check.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects part (a) to be answered with the four primes listed in one box, separated by commas. But I think in the context of the problem, each prime is a separate answer. However, the original instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". So, maybe for part (a), the answer is four primes, and for part (b), the answer is the proof. However, since part (b) is a proof, not a numerical answer, maybe the user expects only part (a) to have boxed answers. But the user hasn't specified. Given the original problem, maybe the user expects part (a) to have four boxed numbers. However, the standard way on platforms like this is to have each part's answer boxed. But since part (a) has multiple answers, maybe they should be boxed individually. But I need to check the initial problem's instructions again.

Looking back: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." So, the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". So, maybe for part (a), the final answer is the four primes, so maybe they should be boxed as a list. However, the standard practice in math problems is to box each answer separately. But since the user hasn't specified, and given that part (a) is multiple answers, I think the safest way is to box each of the four primes. However, in the problem statement, the example is given as 3 = 2^2 -1, so the four more primes are 7, 31, 127, 8191. Therefore, I will present them as four boxed numbers.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{7}, \boxed{31}, \boxed{127}, \boxed{8191}

(b) The proof is as follows: If $ p = 2^k - 1 $ is prime, then $ k $ must be odd, except when $ k = 2 $. This is because if $ k $ is even and greater than 2, $ 2^k - 1 $ can be factored into $ (2^m - 1)(2^m + 1) $, making it composite. Therefore, $ k $ must be odd or $ k = 2 $.
</think>

To solve the given problem, we examine the set of primes that are one less than a power of 2, i.e., of the form $ p = 2^k - 1 $. These are known as **Mersenne primes**, and while it is not yet known whether there are infinitely many such primes, we are asked to find four more examples and to prove a key property of their exponents.

---

### **(a) Find four more of these primes**

We are given the example $ 3 = 2^2 - 1 $, and we are to find **four more primes** of the form $ 2^k - 1 $.

We compute $ 2^k - 1 $ for various values of $ k $, and check for primality:

- $ k = 3 $: $ 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 $ ✅ (prime)
- $ k = 5 $: $ 2^5 - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31 $ ✅ (prime)
- $ k = 7 $: $ 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127 $ ✅ (prime)
- $ k = 13 $: $ 2^{13} - 1 = 8192 - 1 = 8191 $ ✅ (prime)

These are all known Mersenne primes, and each is a prime number. Therefore, the four additional primes are:

$$
\boxed{7},\ \boxed{31},\ \boxed{127},\ \boxed{8191}
$$

---

### **(b) Show that if $ p = 2^k - 1 $ is prime, then $ k $ is an odd integer, except when $ k = 2 $**

Assume $ p = 2^k - 1 $ is a prime. We want to show that $ k $ must be **odd**, **except when $ k = 2 $**.

#### **Case 1: $ k $ is even, $ k > 2 $**

Suppose $ k $ is even and $ k > 2 $. Then we can write $ k = 2m $ for some integer $ m > 1 $. Then:

$$
2^k - 1 = 2^{2m} - 1 = (2^m)^2 - 1 = (2^m - 1)(2^m + 1)
$$

Both $ 2^m - 1 $ and $ 2^m + 1 $ are integers greater than 1, so their product is **composite**. Therefore, $ 2^k - 1 $ is **not prime** when $ k $ is even and $ k > 2 $.

#### **Case 2: $ k = 2 $**

Then:

$$
2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
$$

which is a prime number. So, $ k = 2 $ is an exception.

#### **Conclusion**

If $ p = 2^k - 1 $ is prime, then:

- If $ k $ is even and $ k > 2 $, $ p $ is **not prime**.
- The only even $ k $ for which $ p $ is prime is $ k = 2 $.
- Therefore, for all other primes of the form $ 2^k - 1 $, $ k $ must be **odd**.

---

### **Final Answers**

**(a)** The four additional primes are:

$$
\boxed{7},\ \boxed{31},\ \boxed{127},\ \boxed{8191}
$$

**(b)** If $ p = 2^k - 1 $ is prime, then $ k $ must be an odd integer, except when $ k = 2 $. This is because if $ k $ is even and $ k > 2 $, then $ 2^k - 1 $ can be factored into two integers greater than 1, making it composite. Therefore, the only even $ k $ that yields a prime is $ k = 2 $.
