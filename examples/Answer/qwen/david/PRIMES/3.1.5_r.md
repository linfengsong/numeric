Okay, so I have these two problems to solve. Let me start with part (a). The problem says: Given that p is a prime and p divides a^n, prove that p^n divides a^n. Hmm, let me think about this.

First, I know that if a prime p divides a number, say a, then p must be a factor of that number. But here, it's not directly saying that p divides a, but rather p divides a^n. So maybe I need to use some properties of prime numbers and exponents.

Let me recall that if a prime p divides a^n, then p must divide a. Is that true? Wait, yes, because if p is a prime and p divides a^n, then p must divide a. Because if p didn't divide a, then a and p would be coprime, and by Euclid's lemma, p wouldn't divide a^n. So that's a key point. Therefore, if p divides a^n, then p divides a. So that would mean that a is a multiple of p. So, let me write that down.

If p | a^n, then p | a. Therefore, a = p * k for some integer k. Then, a^n = (p * k)^n = p^n * k^n. Therefore, p^n divides a^n. So that's the proof. Wait, that seems straightforward. Is there a case where this might not hold? Let me test with numbers. Let's take p=2, a=4, n=2. Then 2 divides 4^2=16, and 2^2=4 divides 16. Yes. Another example: p=3, a=6, n=1. 3 divides 6^1=6, and 3^1=3 divides 6. If n=2, a=6, then 3 divides 6^2=36, and 3^2=9 divides 36. Yes. What if a is 0? Well, if a=0, then a^n is 0, and p divides 0 for any p. Then p^n divides 0, which is true. So that seems okay.

Wait, but maybe there's a more formal way to write this? Like using the lemma that if p divides a^n, then p divides a. Is that a standard lemma? I think it is. Because primes are irreducible, and if a prime divides a power, it must divide the base. So that's the key step here.

Alternatively, maybe using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic? If p divides a^n, then in the prime factorization of a^n, p must be present. Since a^n has the prime factors of a each raised to the n-th power. Therefore, if p is a prime factor of a^n, then p must be a prime factor of a. Therefore, the exponent of p in a^n is at least n times the exponent of p in a. Wait, but if p divides a^n, then the exponent of p in a^n is at least 1. Therefore, the exponent of p in a must be at least 1/n. But since exponents are integers, that would mean the exponent of p in a is at least 1. Therefore, p divides a. Therefore, the exponent of p in a is at least 1, so in a^n it's at least n*1 = n. Therefore, p^n divides a^n. That seems like another way to think about it.

So either way, whether through direct factorization or using the lemma, we can see that if p divides a^n, then p divides a, hence p^n divides a^n. Therefore, part (a) is proved.

Now moving on to part (b). The question says: If gcd(a, b) = p, a prime, what are the possible values of gcd(a², b²), gcd(a², b) and gcd(a³, b²)?

Okay, so first, let me recall that gcd(a, b) = p, which is prime. So that means that p is the greatest common divisor of a and b. Therefore, p divides both a and b, and there is no larger number than p that divides both.

So, since p is the gcd, we can write a = p * m and b = p * n, where m and n are integers such that gcd(m, n) = 1. Because if m and n had a common divisor d > 1, then gcd(a, b) would be p*d, which contradicts the given that gcd(a, b) = p. Therefore, m and n are coprime.

So, with that in mind, let me compute each of the gcds.

First, gcd(a², b²). Let's compute that. Since a = p*m and b = p*n, then a² = p²*m² and b² = p²*n². Therefore, gcd(a², b²) = p² * gcd(m², n²). But since gcd(m, n) = 1, then gcd(m², n²) = 1² = 1. Therefore, gcd(a², b²) = p² * 1 = p². Therefore, the value is p².

Wait, is that always the case? Let me check with an example. Let p=2, a=2*3=6, b=2*5=10. Then gcd(6,10)=2. Then a²=36, b²=100. gcd(36,100) is 4, which is 2². Yes. Another example: p=3, a=3*4=12, b=3*5=15. gcd(12,15)=3. Then a²=144, b²=225. gcd(144,225)= 9, which is 3². So that seems to check out. Therefore, the first answer is p².

Now, moving on to gcd(a², b). Let's compute that. Again, a = p*m, b = p*n. Then a² = p²*m², and b = p*n. Therefore, gcd(p²*m², p*n). Let's factor out p. So gcd(p²*m², p*n) = p * gcd(p*m², n). Now, since gcd(m, n) = 1, then gcd(m², n) = 1. Therefore, gcd(p*m², n) = gcd(p, n) * gcd(m², n) = gcd(p, n) * 1. But since gcd(m, n) = 1, and m and n are coprime, but what about p and n? Well, since gcd(a, b) = p, and a = p*m, b = p*n. So, since gcd(a, b) = p, then gcd(p*m, p*n) = p * gcd(m, n) = p*1 = p. Therefore, gcd(m, n) = 1. However, does p divide n? Well, suppose that p divides n. Then, since b = p*n, then p divides b, but since gcd(a, b) = p, then p divides a and b, but if p divides n, then since a = p*m, then gcd(a, b) would be p * gcd(m, n). But since gcd(m, n) = 1, if p divides n, then gcd(m, n) is 1, so the gcd(a, b) is p*1 = p. Therefore, that's okay. Wait, but if p divides n, then n is a multiple of p? But then, since m and n are coprime, m cannot be a multiple of p. Therefore, in that case, n could be a multiple of p, but m cannot be.

But in the gcd(p*m², n), since n is a multiple of p? Wait, but if n is a multiple of p, then gcd(p*m², n) would be gcd(p*m², p*k) where k is some integer. But since m and n are coprime, and n is p*k, then m and k must be coprime? Wait, no. Wait, n = p*k, and since gcd(m, n) = 1, then m and p*k must be coprime. Therefore, m and p must be coprime, and m and k must be coprime. Therefore, since m and p are coprime, then p does not divide m. Therefore, in gcd(p*m², n) = gcd(p*m², p*k) = p * gcd(m², k). But since m and k are coprime, then gcd(m², k) = 1. Therefore, gcd(p*m², n) = p*1 = p. Therefore, going back, gcd(a², b) = p * gcd(p*m², n) = p * p = p²? Wait, but hold on. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, I had:

gcd(a², b) = gcd(p²*m², p*n) = p * gcd(p*m², n). Then, since gcd(p*m², n) = gcd(p, n) * gcd(m², n / gcd(p, n))? Wait, maybe my previous reasoning was wrong.

Alternatively, since m and n are coprime, and n can be divisible by p or not? Wait, but if n is divisible by p, then since m and n are coprime, m cannot be divisible by p. Therefore, in that case, n = p*k, where k is coprime with m. Therefore, gcd(p*m², n) = gcd(p*m², p*k) = p * gcd(m², k). But since m and k are coprime, gcd(m², k) = 1, so this is p*1 = p. Therefore, the whole thing is p * p = p². But if n is not divisible by p, then gcd(p*m², n) = gcd(p*m², n). Since n is not divisible by p, and m and n are coprime, then m² and n are coprime. Therefore, gcd(p*m², n) = gcd(p, n) * gcd(m², n) = 1 * 1 = 1. Therefore, gcd(a², b) = p * 1 = p.

Wait, so this seems like there are two possibilities? Depending on whether n is divisible by p or not. But hold on, but earlier we said that gcd(m, n) = 1. If n is divisible by p, then since m and n are coprime, m cannot be divisible by p. But does that affect the gcd(a², b)?

But in the problem statement, it says that gcd(a, b) = p. So, if n is divisible by p, then b = p*n would have p^2 as a factor? Wait, no. Wait, if n is divisible by p, then b = p*n = p*(p*k) = p²*k. But then, since a = p*m, and m is coprime with n = p*k, so m is coprime with p*k. Therefore, m is coprime with p, so m is not divisible by p. Therefore, a = p*m, which is p times something not divisible by p. Therefore, gcd(a, b) = p * gcd(m, n). But since n = p*k, gcd(m, p*k) = gcd(m, k) because m is coprime with p. But since m and n are coprime, which is m and p*k are coprime, so m and k are coprime. Therefore, gcd(m, k) = 1. Therefore, gcd(a, b) = p*1 = p. Therefore, that is okay.

Therefore, in this case, if n is divisible by p, then gcd(a², b) = p², and if n is not divisible by p, then gcd(a², b) = p. Wait, so does that mean that gcd(a², b) can be either p or p²? But the problem says "what are the possible values", so maybe both p and p² are possible? But how?

Wait, let me test with examples.

First example: Let p = 2, a = 2*3 = 6, b = 2*5 = 10. Then gcd(a, b) = 2. Then a² = 36, b = 10. gcd(36, 10) = 2. So here, it's p.

Another example: Let p = 2, a = 2*3 = 6, b = 2*2 = 4. Wait, but then gcd(a, b) = gcd(6, 4) = 2. But here, n = 2, which is divisible by p=2. Then, a² = 36, b = 4. gcd(36, 4) = 4 = p². So here, it is p².

But wait, in this case, gcd(m, n) where m = 3, n = 2. gcd(3, 2) = 1. So that's okay. Therefore, in this case, the gcd(a², b) is p². Therefore, depending on whether n is divisible by p or not, the gcd(a², b) can be p or p². Therefore, the possible values are p and p². But wait, is there a case where it's something else?

Wait, but if n is divisible by p, then since n = p*k, and m is coprime with n, then m is coprime with p*k. Therefore, m is coprime with p, so m is not divisible by p. Therefore, in that case, when we compute gcd(a², b) = gcd(p²*m², p*n) = p * gcd(p*m², n). Since n = p*k, then gcd(p*m², p*k) = p * gcd(m², k). Since m and k are coprime, gcd(m², k) = 1. Therefore, the whole thing is p * p = p². If n is not divisible by p, then n is coprime with p, so gcd(p*m², n) = gcd(p, n) * gcd(m², n) = 1 * 1 = 1. Therefore, the whole thing is p * 1 = p. Therefore, yes, the possible values of gcd(a², b) are p and p². But wait, but in the problem statement, they say "what are the possible values", so maybe both p and p² are possible. However, is there a way to determine which one is possible?

But since the problem says that gcd(a, b) = p, which is prime. So, depending on whether b is divisible by p² or not. Since b = p*n, and n can be any integer coprime with m. So, n can be divisible by p or not. Therefore, the gcd(a², b) can be either p or p². Therefore, the possible values are p and p². Wait, but let me check another example where n is not divisible by p. Let me take p=2, a=2*3=6, b=2*5=10. Then gcd(a², b) is gcd(36, 10)=2=p. If I take b=2*7=14, same thing. If I take b=2*1=2, then gcd(a², b)=gcd(36, 2)=2. If I take b=2*2=4, then gcd(36,4)=4=p². Therefore, yes, both possibilities exist. Therefore, the answer for gcd(a², b) is either p or p². But the problem says "what are the possible values", so maybe both?

But wait, let me think again. Is there a way to have gcd(a², b) be something else? For example, suppose p=2, a=2*1=2, b=2*1=2. Then gcd(a, b)=2. Then a²=4, b=2. gcd(4,2)=2=p. If I take a=2*1=2, b=2*3=6. Then gcd(a², b)=gcd(4,6)=2=p. If I take a=2*3=6, b=2*2=4, then gcd(36,4)=4=p². So yes, both possibilities. Therefore, the possible values of gcd(a², b) are p and p².

But the problem says "what are the possible values", so maybe we need to write both. However, maybe there's a way to express it in terms of the exponents. Wait, but maybe there's a more precise way. Wait, but the problem says "possible values", so maybe both p and p² are possible, depending on the specific a and b. Therefore, the answer is that gcd(a², b) can be either p or p².

But let me check another angle. Since gcd(a, b) = p, so a = p*m, b = p*n, with gcd(m, n) = 1. Then, in terms of exponents, if we consider the prime factorization of a and b. Since p is the gcd, then in the prime factorization of a and b, the exponent of p in a is at least 1, and same for b. But since gcd(m, n) = 1, m and n share no common prime factors. Therefore, if n is divisible by p, then since m and n are coprime, m is not divisible by p. Therefore, in that case, the exponent of p in b is at least 2, while in a it's exactly 1. Therefore, when we take gcd(a², b), the exponent of p in a² is 2, and in b is at least 2. Therefore, the exponent of p in gcd(a², b) is min(2, exponent of p in b). But since exponent of p in b is at least 2? Wait, no. Wait, if n is divisible by p, then b = p*n = p*(p*k) = p²*k. Therefore, exponent of p in b is at least 2. If n is not divisible by p, then exponent of p in b is exactly 1. Therefore, in that case, the exponent of p in gcd(a², b) is min(2, exponent of p in b). If exponent of p in b is 2, then min(2, 2) = 2. If exponent of p in b is 1, then min(2, 1) = 1. Therefore, the exponent of p in gcd(a², b) is either 1 or 2, hence the gcd is p^1 or p^2. Therefore, yes, possible values are p and p².

Therefore, the answer for gcd(a², b) is either p or p².

Now, moving on to the third part: gcd(a³, b²). Let me compute that. Again, a = p*m, b = p*n, with gcd(m, n) = 1. Therefore, a³ = p³*m³, b² = p²*n². Therefore, gcd(a³, b²) = p^{min(3, 2)} * gcd(m³, n²). Since gcd(m, n) = 1, then gcd(m³, n²) = 1. Therefore, gcd(a³, b²) = p^2 * 1 = p². Wait, but is that always the case?

Wait, let me check with examples. First example: a=6, b=10, p=2. Then a³=216, b²=100. gcd(216, 100) = 4 = 2². Another example: a=6, b=4, p=2. Then a³=216, b²=16. gcd(216,16)= 8=2³? Wait, 216 is 2³*3³, 16 is 2⁴. Therefore, gcd is 2³=8. But according to my previous reasoning, it should be p²=4. Wait, that contradicts. What's wrong here?

Wait, hold on. Let me check my reasoning again. If a = p*m, b = p*n, with gcd(m, n) = 1. Then a³ = p³*m³, b² = p²*n². Therefore, gcd(a³, b²) = gcd(p³*m³, p²*n²) = p² * gcd(p*m³, n²). Since gcd(m, n) = 1, then gcd(m³, n²) = 1. But what about gcd(p*m³, n²)? Since n² is coprime with m³, but what about p? If n is divisible by p, then n² is divisible by p², but since m and n are coprime, m is not divisible by p. Therefore, gcd(p*m³, n²) = gcd(p, n²) * gcd(m³, n²). Since m and n are coprime, gcd(m³, n²) = 1. Therefore, gcd(p, n²) is either 1 or p. If n is divisible by p, then gcd(p, n²) = p. If not, then it's 1. Therefore, the whole thing is p² * [gcd(p, n²)].

Therefore, if n is divisible by p, then gcd(p, n²) = p, so gcd(a³, b²) = p² * p = p³. If n is not divisible by p, then gcd(p, n²) = 1, so gcd(a³, b²) = p² * 1 = p². Therefore, the possible values are p² and p³. Therefore, my previous reasoning was wrong because I didn't consider that if n is divisible by p, then gcd(p*m³, n²) can be p. Therefore, the answer is that gcd(a³, b²) can be either p² or p³.

Wait, let me check with the example where a=6, b=4. Here, a=2*3, b=2*2. Therefore, n=2, which is divisible by p=2. Therefore, gcd(a³, b²) = gcd(216, 16) = 8 = 2³. Which is p³. Another example where n is not divisible by p: a=6, b=10. Then, n=5, not divisible by p=2. Therefore, gcd(a³, b²) = gcd(216, 100) = 4 = p². Therefore, that works. Another example: a=2*1=2, b=2*3=6. Then, n=3, not divisible by p=2. Then, gcd(a³, b²) = gcd(8, 36) = 4 = p². If a=2*1=2, b=2*2=4, then n=2, divisible by p=2. Then, gcd(8, 16)=8=2³. Therefore, that's correct. Therefore, the possible values are p² and p³.

Therefore, the answer for gcd(a³, b²) is either p² or p³.

But let me think again. How do we know that n can be divisible by p? Well, since b = p*n, and n can be any integer coprime with m. Since m is coprime with n, and m can be anything as long as it's coprime with n. Therefore, n can be divisible by p or not. Therefore, depending on that, we have two possibilities.

Therefore, putting it all together:

For part (b):

- gcd(a², b²) is always p².

- gcd(a², b) can be either p or p².

- gcd(a³, b²) can be either p² or p³.

But the problem says "what are the possible values", so we need to specify all possible values for each.

But let me check if there's a way to express this more formally.

For gcd(a², b²): Since a = p*m, b = p*n, with gcd(m, n) = 1. Then, a² = p²*m², b² = p²*n². Therefore, gcd(a², b²) = p² * gcd(m², n²) = p² * 1 = p². Therefore, it's always p². So that's fixed.

For gcd(a², b): As discussed, it can be p or p².

For gcd(a³, b²): It can be p² or p³.

Therefore, the answers are:

gcd(a², b²) = p²,

gcd(a², b) can be p or p²,

gcd(a³, b²) can be p² or p³.

But let me check if there's a case where gcd(a³, b²) is something else. Suppose p=2, a=2*3=6, b=2*2=4. Then, gcd(a³, b²) = gcd(216, 16) = 8 = 2³. If a=2*3=6, b=2*5=10, then gcd(216, 100) = 4 = 2². If a=2*1=2, b=2*1=2, then gcd(8, 4) = 4 = 2². If a=2*1=2, b=2*2=4, then gcd(8, 16) = 8 = 2³. So yes, both possibilities exist.

Therefore, the possible values are as above.

But the problem says "what are the possible values", so for each of the three, we need to specify. For gcd(a², b²), it's uniquely p². For the others, they can be either p or p², and p² or p³ respectively.

But let me check if there's a way to express them in terms of exponents. For example, since gcd(a, b) = p, then in terms of exponents of p in a and b, let me denote:

Let’s suppose that in the prime factorization of a, the exponent of p is e, and in b, it's f. Since gcd(a, b) = p, then the minimum of e and f is 1. Therefore, either e = 1 and f ≥ 1, or f = 1 and e ≥ 1, or both e and f ≥ 1, but min(e, f) = 1. Wait, but since gcd(a, b) = p, then the exponent of p in gcd(a, b) is 1, so min(e, f) = 1. Therefore, either e = 1 and f ≥ 1, or f = 1 and e ≥ 1, or both e and f are ≥ 1 with min(e, f) = 1. Therefore, in any case, at least one of e or f is 1.

But for gcd(a², b²), the exponent of p is min(2e, 2f) = 2*min(e, f) = 2*1 = 2. Therefore, it's p². Therefore, that's fixed.

For gcd(a², b): the exponent of p is min(2e, f). Since min(e, f) = 1. Therefore, if e = 1 and f ≥ 1, then min(2e, f) = min(2, f). If f ≥ 1, then if f = 1, min(2, 1) = 1. If f ≥ 2, min(2, f) = 2. Therefore, the exponent is 1 or 2. Therefore, the value is p or p².

Similarly, for gcd(a³, b²): exponent of p is min(3e, 2f). Since min(e, f) = 1. So, let's consider cases:

Case 1: e = 1, f ≥ 1. Then, min(3*1, 2f) = min(3, 2f). If f = 1, then min(3, 2) = 2. If f ≥ 2, then min(3, 2f) is 3 if 2f ≥ 3, which is when f ≥ 2 (since 2*2=4 ≥ 3). Therefore, if e=1, f=1: exponent is 2. If e=1, f ≥ 2: exponent is 3. Therefore, in this case, exponent is 2 or 3.

Case 2: f = 1, e ≥ 1. Then, min(3e, 2*1) = min(3e, 2). Since e ≥ 1, 3e ≥ 3. Therefore, min(3e, 2) = 2. Therefore, exponent is 2. Therefore, in this case, exponent is always 2.

Therefore, combining both cases: if e=1 and f=1, exponent is 2. If e=1 and f ≥ 2, exponent is 3. If f=1 and e ≥ 2, exponent is 2. Therefore, the exponent can be 2 or 3. Therefore, the gcd(a³, b²) can be p² or p³. Therefore, this confirms the previous conclusion.

Therefore, the possible values are:

- gcd(a², b²) = p²

- gcd(a², b) can be p or p²

- gcd(a³, b²) can be p² or p³

Therefore, the answers are:

(a) Proven as above.

(b) The possible values are:

gcd(a², b²) = p²,

gcd(a², b) is either p or p²,

gcd(a³, b²) is either p² or p³.

But the problem says "what are the possible values", so for each, we need to specify. However, maybe the problem expects specific answers. For example, for gcd(a², b), since gcd(a, b) = p, then a and b share exactly one factor of p. Therefore, when you square a, you have two factors of p, and when you take gcd with b, which has one factor of p, then the gcd would have one factor of p. However, if b has more factors of p, then the gcd would have more. But since the gcd(a, b) is p, then b can have more factors of p, but since gcd(a, b) is p, then a can't have more than one factor of p? Wait, no. Wait, if a has more than one factor of p, then since gcd(a, b) is p, then b can't have more than one factor of p. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if a has more than one factor of p, say e ≥ 2, then since gcd(a, b) = p, which has exponent 1, then b must have exponent of p equal to 1. Therefore, if e ≥ 2, then f = 1. Similarly, if f ≥ 2, then e = 1. Therefore, in that case, for gcd(a², b), if e ≥ 2 and f = 1, then the exponent is min(2e, f) = min(2e, 1) = 1. If e = 1 and f ≥ 2, then min(2, f) = 2. Therefore, the exponent is 1 or 2. Therefore, the possible values are p and p². Therefore, that's consistent with the earlier conclusion.

Therefore, the answer for part (b) is:

gcd(a², b²) = p²,

gcd(a², b) can be p or p²,

gcd(a³, b²) can be p² or p³.

But the problem says "what are the possible values", so I think that's the answer. However, maybe the problem expects specific answers, but given that the gcd(a, b) is p, which is prime, the possible values are as above.

Therefore, summarizing:

(a) Proven by showing that if p divides a^n, then p divides a, hence p^n divides a^n.

(b) The possible values are:

- gcd(a², b²) = p²,

- gcd(a², b) ∈ {p, p²},

- gcd(a³, b²) ∈ {p², p³}.

Therefore, the final answers are as above.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{p^n} divides $a^n$.

(b) The possible values are $\gcd(a^2, b^2) = \boxed{p^2}$, $\gcd(a^2, b)$ can be $\boxed{p}$ or $\boxed{p^2}$, and $\gcd(a^3, b^2)$ can be $\boxed{p^2}$ or $\boxed{p^3}$.

### (a) Proof that $ p^n \mid a^n $ given $ p \mid a^n $

We are given that $ p $ is a prime and $ p \mid a^n $. We are to show that $ p^n \mid a^n $.

---

**Step 1: Prime Divisibility and Exponentiation**

A key property of prime numbers is that if a prime $ p $ divides a power $ a^n $, then $ p $ must divide $ a $. This follows from the **Euclidean Lemma**: if $ p \mid ab $ and $ p $ is prime, then $ p \mid a $ or $ p \mid b $. Applying this recursively, if $ p \mid a^n $, then $ p \mid a $.

So, we can write $ a = p \cdot k $ for some integer $ k $.

---

**Step 2: Compute $ a^n $**

$$
a^n = (p \cdot k)^n = p^n \cdot k^n
$$

Hence, $ p^n \mid a^n $, as required.

---

**Conclusion for (a):**

$$
\boxed{p^n \mid a^n}
$$

### (b) Possible Values of $ \gcd(a^2, b^2) $, $ \gcd(a^2, b) $, and $ \gcd(a^3, b^2) $ given $ \gcd(a, b) = p $, where $ p $ is prime

We are given that $ \gcd(a, b) = p $, a prime. This implies that:

- $ p \mid a $ and $ p \mid b $,
- $ \gcd(a, b) = p $, so $ a = p \cdot m $, $ b = p \cdot n $, where $ \gcd(m, n) = 1 $.

Let’s analyze each expression:

---

#### **1. $ \gcd(a^2, b^2) $**

$$
a = p \cdot m, \quad b = p \cdot n \Rightarrow a^2 = p^2 \cdot m^2, \quad b^2 = p^2 \cdot n^2
$$

$$
\gcd(a^2, b^2) = \gcd(p^2 \cdot m^2, p^2 \cdot n^2) = p^2 \cdot \gcd(m^2, n^2)
$$

Since $ \gcd(m, n) = 1 $, then $ \gcd(m^2, n^2) = 1 $, so:

$$
\gcd(a^2, b^2) = p^2
$$

#### **2. $ \gcd(a^2, b) $**

$$
a^2 = p^2 \cdot m^2, \quad b = p \cdot n
$$

$$
\gcd(a^2, b) = \gcd(p^2 \cdot m^2, p \cdot n) = p \cdot \gcd(p \cdot m^2, n)
$$

Since $ \gcd(m, n) = 1 $, then $ \gcd(m^2, n) = 1 $, so:

$$
\gcd(p \cdot m^2, n) = \gcd(p, n)
$$

Now, $ \gcd(p, n) $ can be:

- $ 1 $, if $ n $ is not divisible by $ p $,
- $ p $, if $ n $ is divisible by $ p $.

Thus, the possible values of $ \gcd(a^2, b) $ are:

$$
\gcd(a^2, b) = p \text{ or } p^2
$$

#### **3. $ \gcd(a^3, b^2) $**

$$
a^3 = p^3 \cdot m^3, \quad b^2 = p^2 \cdot n^2
$$

$$
\gcd(a^3, b^2) = \gcd(p^3 \cdot m^3, p^2 \cdot n^2) = p^2 \cdot \gcd(p \cdot m^3, n^2)
$$

Again, since $ \gcd(m, n) = 1 $, $ \gcd(m^3, n^2) = 1 $, so:

$$
\gcd(p \cdot m^3, n^2) = \gcd(p, n^2)
$$

As before, $ \gcd(p, n^2) $ can be:

- $ 1 $, if $ n $ is not divisible by $ p $,
- $ p $, if $ n $ is divisible by $ p $.

Thus, the possible values of $ \gcd(a^3, b^2) $ are:

$$
\gcd(a^3, b^2) = p^2 \text{ or } p^3
$$
