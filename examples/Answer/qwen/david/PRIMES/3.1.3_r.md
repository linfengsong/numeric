Okay, so I need to prove these five statements. Let me take them one by one. Starting with part (a): Any prime of the form 3n + 1 is also of the form 6m + 1. Hmm. Let me think. 

First, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The form 3n + 1 means that when you divide the number by 3, the remainder is 1. Similarly, 6m + 1 is a number that when divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 1. So, if a prime is of the form 3n + 1, then it's congruent to 1 modulo 3. But how does that relate to modulo 6?

Well, numbers modulo 6 can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If a number is congruent to 1 mod 3, then it can be either 1 or 4 mod 6. Because 1 mod 3 is 1 mod 6, and 4 mod 6 is also 1 mod 3 (since 4 - 3 = 1). So primes of the form 3n + 1 can be either 1 or 4 mod 6. But primes greater than 2 can't be even, so they can't be 0 mod 2. So if a number is 4 mod 6, that's equivalent to 2 mod 3, but wait, no. Wait, 4 mod 6 is 4 mod 3, which is 1 mod 3. Wait, 4 divided by 3 is 1 with remainder 1. So 4 mod 6 is 1 mod 3. So primes of the form 3n + 1 can be 1 mod 6 or 4 mod 6. But primes can't be even, so if a prime is 4 mod 6, that would mean it's even? Wait, no. 4 mod 6 is 4, which is even. But primes except 2 are odd. So if a prime is 4 mod 6, then it's even, so the only even prime is 2. But 2 is 2 mod 3, which is not 1 mod 3. Therefore, primes of the form 3n + 1 cannot be 4 mod 6, because that would make them even and greater than 2, which is impossible. Therefore, primes of the form 3n + 1 must be 1 mod 6. Therefore, they are of the form 6m + 1. 

So that seems to check out. Let me test with examples. Take 7, which is 3*2 + 1 = 7. 7 is also 6*1 + 1. Another example: 13 is 3*4 + 1, and 13 is 6*2 + 1. What about 31? 3*10 + 1 = 31, and 6*5 + 1 = 31. So yes, seems like primes of the form 3n + 1 are also 6m + 1. So that's part (a).

Moving on to part (b): Each integer of the form 3n + 2 has a prime factor of this form. So, if I have an integer that's 3n + 2, then it must have a prime factor that is also 3m + 2. Let me think. 

First, note that 3n + 2 is congruent to 2 mod 3. So, if we have such a number, then its prime factors must be congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3. Because primes other than 3 are either 1 or 2 mod 3. If the number is 3n + 2, then it's not divisible by 3, since 3n + 2 mod 3 is 2. Therefore, any prime factor of it cannot be 3. Therefore, the prime factors must be congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3. 

But the question is, does it have a prime factor of the form 3m + 2? Suppose that all prime factors are congruent to 1 mod 3. Then the product of numbers congruent to 1 mod 3 would be 1 mod 3. But our number is 2 mod 3. Therefore, that's a contradiction. Therefore, there must be at least one prime factor congruent to 2 mod 3. Therefore, the number must have a prime factor of the form 3m + 2. 

Therefore, part (b) is proven. Let me check with an example. Take 5, which is 3*1 + 2. Its prime factor is 5, which is 3*1 + 2. Another example: 8 is 3*2 + 2. Its prime factors are 2 and 2. Wait, 2 is 3*0 + 2. So that's okay. 2 is of the form 3m + 2. So that works. Another example: 11 is 3*3 + 2. Prime factor is 11, which is 3*3 + 2. Another example: 14 is 3*4 + 2. Its prime factors are 2 and 7. 2 is 3*0 + 2, and 7 is 3*2 + 1. Wait, but 7 is 1 mod 3. But 14 is 2 mod 3, so the product of 2 (which is 2 mod 3) and 7 (which is 1 mod 3) is 2*1 = 2 mod 3. So that works. But the question is, does it have a prime factor of the form 3m + 2? Yes, 2 is. So even though 7 is 1 mod 3, there is a prime factor 2 which is 2 mod 3. Therefore, that works. So part (b) is proven.

Moving on to part (c): The only prime of the form n³ - 1 is 7. Let's see. So n³ - 1 can be factored as (n - 1)(n² + n + 1). Therefore, if n³ - 1 is prime, then one of the factors must be 1, because primes have only two positive divisors. So either n - 1 = 1 or n² + n + 1 = 1. Let's check both possibilities.

First case: n - 1 = 1 => n = 2. Then n³ - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7, which is prime. Second case: n² + n + 1 = 1. Solving n² + n + 1 = 1 => n² + n = 0 => n(n + 1) = 0. Therefore, n = 0 or n = -1. Let's check these. If n = 0, then 0³ - 1 = -1, which is not prime. If n = -1, then (-1)³ - 1 = -1 -1 = -2, which is not prime. Therefore, the only possible value is n = 2, giving 7. Therefore, the only prime of the form n³ - 1 is 7. 

Wait, but let me check for other n. Suppose n = 1: 1 - 1 = 0, not prime. n = 3: 27 - 1 = 26, which is not prime. n = 4: 64 - 1 = 63, not prime. n = 5: 125 - 1 = 124, not prime. So yes, only n = 2 gives 7. Therefore, part (c) is proven.

Part (d): The only prime p for which 3p + 1 is a perfect square is p = 5. Let me think. Let me denote 3p + 1 = k², where k is a positive integer. Then, 3p = k² - 1 = (k - 1)(k + 1). Therefore, 3p = (k - 1)(k + 1). Since p is prime, the factors (k - 1) and (k + 1) must be 1 and 3p, or 3 and p, or p and 3, or something else? Wait, since (k - 1) and (k + 1) differ by 2. So they are two numbers differing by 2, whose product is 3p. Since p is prime, the factors can be 1 and 3p, or 3 and p. Let me check.

Case 1: k - 1 = 1 and k + 1 = 3p. Then, solving k - 1 = 1 gives k = 2. Then k + 1 = 3, so 3 = 3p => p = 1. But 1 is not prime. So this case doesn't work.

Case 2: k - 1 = 3 and k + 1 = p. Then, solving k - 1 = 3 gives k = 4. Then k + 1 = 5, so p = 5. Which is prime. So that works.

Case 3: k - 1 = p and k + 1 = 3. Then, solving k + 1 = 3 gives k = 2. Then k - 1 = 1, so p = 1, which is not prime. So invalid.

Case 4: k - 1 = 3p and k + 1 = 1. Then k + 1 = 1 gives k = 0, which would make k - 1 = -1, so 3p = -1, which is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe there are other factorizations? Since 3p is the product of two numbers differing by 2. Since p is prime, the only possible factorizations are as above. Because 3p can be written as 1 * 3p, 3 * p, or p * 3, or 3p * 1. But since k - 1 and k + 1 differ by 2, the only possible pairs are (1, 3p) which differ by 3p - 1, which is more than 2 unless p is small. Similarly, (3, p) differ by p - 3. For this to be 2, p - 3 = 2 => p = 5, which is the case we found. Similarly, if we consider (p, 3), then p - 3 = 2 => p = 5 again. Wait, but in case 2, we had k - 1 = 3 and k + 1 = p, which gives p = 5. Alternatively, if k - 1 = p and k + 1 = 3, then p = 1, which is invalid. So the only valid case is p = 5. 

Alternatively, maybe there are other possibilities? Suppose that 3p is a product of two numbers differing by 2. Let me think. Since 3p is 3 times prime. So the factors could be 1 and 3p, 3 and p. Since 3 and p differ by p - 3. For this difference to be 2, p - 3 = 2 => p = 5. Alternatively, if the factors are p and 3, then same thing. So that's the only case. Therefore, p = 5 is the only solution. 

Let me check with examples. If p = 5, then 3*5 + 1 = 16, which is 4². Correct. What if p = 2? 3*2 + 1 = 7, not a square. p = 3: 3*3 + 1 = 10, not square. p = 7: 3*7 + 1 = 22, not square. p = 11: 3*11 + 1 = 34, not square. So yes, only p = 5. Therefore, part (d) is proven.

Part (e): The only prime of the form n² - 4 is 5. Let me think. So n² - 4 factors as (n - 2)(n + 2). So if n² - 4 is prime, then one of the factors must be 1, because primes have only two positive divisors. So either n - 2 = 1 or n + 2 = 1. Let me check.

Case 1: n - 2 = 1 => n = 3. Then n² - 4 = 9 - 4 = 5, which is prime. 

Case 2: n + 2 = 1 => n = -1. Then n² - 4 = 1 - 4 = -3, which is not prime. 

Alternatively, maybe the factors are -1 and -prime? But since we are talking about positive primes, probably n is such that n² - 4 is positive. So n² - 4 > 0 => |n| > 2. So n can be 3, 4, etc. So for n ≥ 3, n² - 4 is positive. For n = 3, we get 5. For n = 4, 16 - 4 = 12, not prime. For n = 5, 25 - 4 = 21, not prime. For n = 6, 36 - 4 = 32, not prime. For n = 2, 4 - 4 = 0, not prime. For n = 1, 1 - 4 = -3, not prime. For n = 0, -4, not prime. For n = -3, 9 - 4 = 5, same as n = 3. So n = -3 gives 5 as well. But 5 is prime. Therefore, the only primes are 5. 

Wait, but let me check if there are other possibilities. Suppose that (n - 2)(n + 2) is prime. Since primes are positive integers greater than 1, then both factors must be positive integers. Therefore, n - 2 and n + 2 are positive integers, so n > 2. Therefore, the only way is that one of the factors is 1, which gives n = 3. Hence, only 5. 

Alternatively, could there be cases where one of the factors is -1? For example, if n - 2 = -1, then n = 1, which gives n² - 4 = -3, not prime. Similarly, n + 2 = -1 gives n = -3, which gives 5, which is prime. But since primes are positive, we can consider n = -3 as valid, but the prime is still 5. So regardless, the only prime is 5. Therefore, part (e) is proven.

Wait, but let me check if there are other factorizations. For example, if n - 2 and n + 2 are both primes? But since their product is prime, one of them must be 1. So that's not possible unless one is 1. Therefore, only possible when n - 2 = 1 or n + 2 = 1, leading to n = 3 or n = -1. Only n = 3 gives a prime. Therefore, yes, only 5.

So all parts are proven. Let me recap:

(a) Primes of the form 3n + 1 are 1 mod 6 because they can't be 4 mod 6 (as that would make them even and greater than 2).

(b) Any number 3n + 2 is 2 mod 3, so if it's not prime, its prime factors must include at least one 2 mod 3 prime.

(c) n³ - 1 factors into (n - 1)(n² + n + 1), so the only prime is when one factor is 1, leading to n = 2, giving 7.

(d) 3p + 1 = k² leads to factors (k - 1)(k + 1) = 3p, so only possible when k - 1 = 3 and k + 1 = 5, leading to p = 5.

(e) n² - 4 factors into (n - 2)(n + 2), so only possible prime is when one factor is 1, leading to n = 3, giving 5.

All steps seem to check out. I think that's it.

**Final Answer**

(a) $\boxed{6m + 1}$

(b) $\boxed{3m + 2}$

(c) $\boxed{7}$

(d) $\boxed{5}$

(e) $\boxed{5}$

To prove the given assertions, we proceed step by step, analyzing the structure of the expressions and leveraging number theory principles such as modular arithmetic, factorization, and properties of primes.

### **(a) Any prime of the form $ 3n + 1 $ is also of the form $ 6m + 1 $.**

A number of the form $ 3n + 1 $ is congruent to 1 modulo 3. In modulo 6, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The numbers congruent to 1 mod 3 are 1 and 4 mod 6. That is, any number congruent to 1 mod 3 is either $ 6m + 1 $ or $ 6m + 4 $.

However, any number of the form $ 6m + 4 $ is even (since 4 is even), and the only even prime is 2. But 2 is not of the form $ 3n + 1 $, as $ 2 \equiv 2 \mod 3 $. Therefore, a prime of the form $ 3n + 1 $ must be congruent to 1 mod 6.

**Conclusion:** Any prime of the form $ 3n + 1 $ is also of the form $ 6m + 1 $.  
$$
\boxed{6m + 1}
$$

### **(b) Each integer of the form $ 3n + 2 $ has a prime factor of this form.**

An integer of the form $ 3n + 2 $ is congruent to 2 mod 3. Since 3 is not a factor of such a number, any prime factor of it must be congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3.

Suppose all prime factors of $ 3n + 2 $ were congruent to 1 mod 3. Then the product of such primes would be 1 mod 3, which contradicts the fact that $ 3n + 2 \equiv 2 \mod 3 $. Therefore, at least one prime factor must be congruent to 2 mod 3, i.e., of the form $ 3m + 2 $.

**Conclusion:** Every integer of the form $ 3n + 2 $ has a prime factor of the form $ 3m + 2 $.  
$$
\boxed{3m + 2}
$$

### **(c) The only prime of the form $ n^3 - 1 $ is 7.**

We factor:
$$
n^3 - 1 = (n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)
$$
If $ n^3 - 1 $ is prime, then one of the factors must be 1. The only possibility is:
- $ n - 1 = 1 \Rightarrow n = 2 \Rightarrow n^3 - 1 = 7 $, which is prime.
- $ n^2 + n + 1 = 1 \Rightarrow n^2 + n = 0 \Rightarrow n(n + 1) = 0 \Rightarrow n = 0 \text{ or } -1 $, both of which yield $ n^3 - 1 = -1 $ or $ -2 $, not prime.

Thus, the only such prime is 7.

**Conclusion:** The only prime of the form $ n^3 - 1 $ is 7.  
$$
\boxed{7}
$$

---

### **(d) The only prime $ p $ for which $ 3p + 1 $ is a perfect square is $ p = 5 $.**

Let $ 3p + 1 = k^2 \Rightarrow 3p = k^2 - 1 = (k - 1)(k + 1) $. Since $ p $ is prime, the factors $ (k - 1) $ and $ (k + 1) $ must be 1 and $ 3p $, or $ 3 $ and $ p $.

- If $ k - 1 = 1 $, then $ k = 2 $, so $ k + 1 = 3 \Rightarrow 3p = 3 \Rightarrow p = 1 $, not prime.
- If $ k - 1 = 3 $, then $ k = 4 $, so $ k + 1 = 5 \Rightarrow 3p = 15 \Rightarrow p = 5 $, which is prime.

Other factorizations lead to non-prime values or invalid results.

**Conclusion:** The only prime $ p $ for which $ 3p + 1 $ is a perfect square is $ p = 5 $.  
$$
\boxed{5}
$$

---

### **(e) The only prime of the form $ n^2 - 4 $ is 5.**

We factor:
$$
n^2 - 4 = (n - 2)(n + 2)
$$
If this is prime, one of the factors must be 1. Then:
- $ n - 2 = 1 \Rightarrow n = 3 \Rightarrow n^2 - 4 = 9 - 4 = 5 $, which is prime.
- $ n + 2 = 1 \Rightarrow n = -1 \Rightarrow n^2 - 4 = 1 - 4 = -3 $, not prime.

Other values of $ n $ yield composite numbers (e.g., $ n = 4 \Rightarrow 12 $, $ n = 5 \Rightarrow 21 $, etc.).

**Conclusion:** The only prime of the form $ n^2 - 4 $ is 5.  
$$
\boxed{5}
$$

---

(a) $\boxed{6m + 1}$
