Okay, so I need to find five primes that are of the form n² - 2. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, I need to find integers n where when I square them and subtract 2, the result is a prime number. Let me start by testing small values of n and see if I can find some primes.

First, let me try n = 1: 1² - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1. Wait, negative numbers aren't primes, right? So that's out.

n = 2: 2² - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2. Oh, 2 is a prime number. So that's one. Great, so n=2 gives me 2.

n = 3: 3² - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7. 7 is a prime. That's another one. So n=3 gives 7.

n = 4: 4² - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14. 14 is not a prime because it's divisible by 2 and 7. So that's out.

n = 5: 5² - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23. 23 is a prime. So that's a third one. n=5 gives 23.

n = 6: 6² - 2 = 36 - 2 = 34. 34 is even, so not prime.

n = 7: 7² - 2 = 49 - 2 = 47. 47 is a prime. That's the fourth one. So n=7 gives 47.

n = 8: 8² - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62. 62 is even, not prime.

n = 9: 9² - 2 = 81 - 2 = 79. 79 is a prime. So that's the fifth one. n=9 gives 79.

Wait, so that's five primes: 2, 7, 23, 47, 79. Let me check each of these again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

For n=2: 2² - 2 = 2. Correct, prime.

n=3: 9 - 2 = 7. Prime.

n=5: 25 - 2 = 23. Prime.

n=7: 49 - 2 = 47. Prime.

n=9: 81 - 2 = 79. Prime. Yeah, all of these are primes. So that gives me five primes of the form n² - 2. 

But wait, the problem says "it has been conjectured that there are infinitely many primes of this form," but I need to exhibit five such primes. So maybe I just need to list these five. Let me check if there are any other primes for n=10 or so, but the question only asks for five, so maybe these five are sufficient.

But let me check n=11: 121 - 2 = 119. 119 is 7*17, so not prime. n=12: 144 - 2 = 142, which is even. n=13: 169 - 2 = 167. 167 is a prime. So that's another one. But since the problem only asks for five, maybe the first five I found are okay.

But let me check again if there are any mistakes. For example, n=2 gives 2, which is prime. n=3 gives 7, prime. n=5 gives 23, prime. n=7 gives 47, prime. n=9 gives 79, prime. So that's five primes. Therefore, the answer is these five primes: 2, 7, 23, 47, 79. 

But wait, let me check n=0? 0² - 2 = -2, which isn't prime. n=1 gives -1, not prime. So starting from n=2, we get the first prime. So yes, these five are valid. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the primes to be in order or something? But the question just says to exhibit five such primes, so listing them as 2, 7, 23, 47, 79 should be okay. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to find them? Let me think. For example, if n is even or odd? Let me check. If n is even, say n=2k, then n² - 2 = 4k² - 2 = 2(2k² - 1). So this is even, so unless 2k² - 1 is 1, which would make the whole thing 2*1=2. So when is 2k² - 1 = 1? 2k² = 2 => k²=1 => k=1. So n=2*1=2. Which gives 2. So that's the only even n that gives a prime. All other even n would result in numbers divisible by 2, hence not prime (except 2 itself). Therefore, all other primes must come from odd n. 

So for odd n, n is odd, so n² is odd, so n² - 2 is odd - even = odd. So that's good, so they can be primes. So for odd n, we can have primes. 

So for example, n=3 (odd): 9 - 2 = 7. n=5: 25 - 2 = 23. n=7: 49 - 2 = 47. n=9: 81 - 2 = 79. n=11: 121 - 2 = 119 (not prime). n=13: 169 - 2 = 167 (prime). So that's another one. So the primes are when n is 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13,... 

So the five primes I found are indeed valid. Therefore, the answer is those five primes. 

But let me check if there are any other primes for smaller n. For example, n=2 is the first, then n=3, 5, 7, 9. So that's five. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the primes in order? But the question doesn't specify, so as long as they are primes of the form n² - 2, they are acceptable. 

Therefore, my conclusion is that the five primes are 2, 7, 23, 47, 79. 

But let me check once again each of them:

- 2: prime.

- 7: prime.

- 23: prime.

- 47: prime.

- 79: prime.

Yes, all primes. So that's five. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the primes to be in the form where n is positive integer? Well, n=2,3,5,7,9 are all positive integers. 

Therefore, I think that's the answer. The five primes are 2, 7, 23, 47, 79.

**Final Answer**
The five primes of the form $n^2 - 2$ are \boxed{2}, \boxed{7}, \boxed{23}, \boxed{47}, and \boxed{79}.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding five prime numbers that can be expressed in the form $ n^2 - 2 $, where $ n $ is a positive integer. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

We will evaluate the expression $ n^2 - 2 $ for successive integer values of $ n $, and check whether the result is a prime number.

- **For $ n = 2 $:**  
  $ 2^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 $ → **Prime**

- **For $ n = 3 $:**  
  $ 3^2 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 $ → **Prime**

- **For $ n = 4 $:**  
  $ 4^2 - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14 $ → Not prime (divisible by 2)

- **For $ n = 5 $:**  
  $ 5^2 - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 $ → **Prime**

- **For $ n = 6 $:**  
  $ 6^2 - 2 = 36 - 2 = 34 $ → Not prime (even number)

- **For $ n = 7 $:**  
  $ 7^2 - 2 = 49 - 2 = 47 $ → **Prime**

- **For $ n = 8 $:**  
  $ 8^2 - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62 $ → Not prime (even number)

- **For $ n = 9 $:**  
  $ 9^2 - 2 = 81 - 2 = 79 $ → **Prime**

At this point, we have found five distinct prime numbers of the form $ n^2 - 2 $:

- $ n = 2 \rightarrow 2 $
- $ n = 3 \rightarrow 7 $
- $ n = 5 \rightarrow 23 $
- $ n = 7 \rightarrow 47 $
- $ n = 9 \rightarrow 79 $
