Okay, so I need to find five sets of five consecutive odd integers where four of them are prime numbers. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better. 

First, consecutive odd integers mean numbers like 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 or something like that. Each number is two more than the previous one. So, if I take a starting number, say n, then the five consecutive odd integers would be n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. Now, out of these five numbers, four should be prime. 

But wait, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. However, except for 2, all primes are odd. Since we're dealing with odd integers, the only even prime is 2. But since we are talking about consecutive odd integers, 2 can't be part of any of these sets unless the starting number is 1 or something. But 1 isn't prime. So maybe 2 isn't going to be in any of these sets. 

So, the challenge is to find five consecutive odd numbers where four are prime. Let me think. Let's start by checking small odd numbers to see if there are such sets.

First, let me check the first few odd numbers:

Starting at 3: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Let's check which are prime. 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is not (divisible by 3), 11 is prime. So here, four primes (3,5,7,11) and one composite (9). So that's a set! So that's one set: {3,5,7,9,11}. 

Okay, so that's one. Let me check another set. Let's try starting at 5: 5,7,9,11,13. 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is not, 11 is prime, 13 is prime. So again, four primes. So that's another set: {5,7,9,11,13}. 

Wait, so starting at 3 and starting at 5 both give sets with four primes. Let me check starting at 7: 7,9,11,13,15. 7 is prime, 9 is not, 11 is prime, 13 is prime, 15 is not. So here, three primes. Not enough. 

Starting at 9: 9,11,13,15,17. 9 is not, 11 is prime, 13 is prime, 15 is not, 17 is prime. So three primes again. 

Starting at 11: 11,13,15,17,19. 11,13,17,19 are primes, 15 is not. So again four primes. So that's another set: {11,13,15,17,19}. 

So that's a third set. Let me check starting at 13: 13,15,17,19,21. 13 is prime, 15 is not, 17 is prime, 19 is prime, 21 is not. Three primes again. 

Starting at 15: 15,17,19,21,23. 15 is not, 17,19,23 are primes, 21 is not. Again three primes. 

Starting at 17: 17,19,21,23,25. 17,19,23 are primes, 21 and 25 are not. Three primes. 

Starting at 19: 19,21,23,25,27. 19,23 are primes, 21,25,27 are not. Two primes. 

Starting at 21: 21,23,25,27,29. 23 and 29 are primes, others not. Two primes. 

Starting at 23: 23,25,27,29,31. 23,29,31 are primes, 25,27 not. Three primes. 

Starting at 25: 25,27,29,31,33. 29,31 are primes, others not. Two primes. 

Starting at 27: 27,29,31,33,35. 29,31 are primes. Others not. Two primes. 

Starting at 29: 29,31,33,35,37. 29,31,37 are primes. 33,35 not. Three primes. 

Starting at 31: 31,33,35,37,39. 31,37 are primes. Others not. Two primes. 

Hmm, so so far, starting at 3, 5, 11, and maybe others? Let me check again. Wait, starting at 3: {3,5,7,9,11} four primes. Starting at 5: {5,7,9,11,13} four primes. Starting at 11: {11,13,15,17,19} four primes. Then starting at 13: three primes. Starting at 17: three primes. Starting at 19: two primes. Starting at 23: three primes. 

Wait, so maybe there are more sets. Let me check starting at 5 again. Wait, 5,7,9,11,13. That's four primes. Then starting at 7: 7,9,11,13,15. Three primes. Starting at 9: 9,11,13,15,17. Three primes. Starting at 11: four primes. Starting at 13: three primes. Starting at 15: three primes. Starting at 17: three primes. Starting at 19: two primes. Starting at 21: two primes. Starting at 23: three primes. Starting at 25: two primes. Starting at 27: two primes. Starting at 29: three primes. 

So maybe there are only three sets? But the question says "find five such sets". So maybe there are more beyond these? Or maybe I need to check higher numbers?

Alternatively, maybe there are some other sets where four numbers are primes. Let me think. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think about the positions of the numbers. Let me denote the five consecutive odd numbers as n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. 

Now, among these five numbers, four are primes. Let me think about the parity. Since they are all odd, they are all odd numbers. Now, primes except 2 are odd, so all numbers here are odd. 

But in the sequence of five consecutive odd numbers, one of them is divisible by 5? Wait, not necessarily. Let me think. For example, in the first set: 3,5,7,9,11. Here, 5 is divisible by 5. In the second set: 5,7,9,11,13. Here, 5 is divisible by 5. In the third set: 11,13,15,17,19. Here, 15 is divisible by 5. 

So maybe in each of these sets, the middle number is divisible by 5? Wait, let's check. The middle number is n+4. For the first set, n=3: 3+4=7, which is not divisible by 5. Wait, but 5 is in the set. Wait, maybe not. Wait, the middle number is the third one. For five numbers, the middle is the third. So for the first set: 3,5,7,9,11. The third is 7. But 5 is the second number. So maybe not. 

Alternatively, maybe the numbers are arranged such that one of them is divisible by 5. For example, in the first set, 5 is prime, but in the second set, 5 is the first number, which is prime. In the third set, 15 is divisible by 5. So maybe in some of these sets, the number divisible by 5 is composite, so that it's not a prime. 

But how does that help? Maybe if we can find a set where the number divisible by 5 is not in the set? Wait, but in five consecutive odd numbers, one of them must be divisible by 5? Let me check. 

Let me think about modulo 5. The numbers are spaced by 2. So, for any five consecutive odd numbers, their residues modulo 5 would be something like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 1, 2, 3, 4, 0 or similar. Because adding 2 each time. Let me check. 

For example, starting at n, the numbers are n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. Let me compute their residues mod 5. Let me think of n mod 5. Let's say n ≡ 0 mod 5. Then the numbers are 0, 2, 4, 1, 3 mod 5. So one of them is 0 mod 5. Similarly, if n ≡ 1 mod 5, the residues would be 1, 3, 0, 2, 4. So again, one of them is 0 mod 5. Similarly for other residues. Therefore, in any five consecutive odd numbers, one of them is divisible by 5. Therefore, if that number is 5 itself, then it's prime. Otherwise, if it's a multiple of 5 greater than 5, then it's composite. 

Therefore, in order for four of the five numbers to be prime, the number divisible by 5 must be 5 itself. Because if it's 15, 25, etc., then it's composite. Therefore, in order to have four primes, the five consecutive odd numbers must include 5 as one of them, and the other numbers must be primes. 

Wait, but in the first set, {3,5,7,9,11}, 5 is included. In the second set {5,7,9,11,13}, 5 is included. In the third set {11,13,15,17,19}, 15 is divisible by 5, which is composite. But here, only three primes. So that's why that set has three primes. Therefore, if the five consecutive numbers include 5, then the number divisible by 5 is 5, which is prime, so that's good. However, if the five consecutive numbers include a multiple of 5 greater than 5, then that number is composite, so we can only have four primes if the other four numbers are primes. 

But in that case, how can we have five consecutive odd numbers where one of them is a multiple of 5 (and hence composite), but the other four are primes? Let me think. For example, if the five numbers are 5,7,9,11,13. Here, 5 is prime, 7, 11, 13 are primes, and 9 is composite. So that's four primes. 

Alternatively, if the five numbers are 15,17,19,21,23. Here, 15 is composite, 17,19,23 are primes, and 21 is composite. So only three primes. 

So the key seems to be that if the multiple of 5 is 5 itself, then that's prime, so we can have four primes. However, if the multiple of 5 is higher, then it's composite, and we need the other four numbers to be primes, but that seems harder. 

Therefore, perhaps the sets where 5 is included are the ones that work. So maybe the first few sets are the ones where 5 is in the set. Let me check. 

So starting at 3: includes 5. Starting at 5: includes 5. Starting at 7: includes 5? No, 7,9,11,13,15. The numbers are 7,9,11,13,15. The multiple of 5 is 15. So 15 is composite, so only three primes. 

Similarly, starting at 11: 11,13,15,17,19. Again, 15 is composite. So three primes. 

So maybe the only sets where the multiple of 5 is 5 itself are the ones where the five numbers include 5. So starting at 3, 5, or maybe starting at something else?

Wait, if I start at 5, the numbers are 5,7,9,11,13. So 5 is included. Starting at 3: 3,5,7,9,11. Also includes 5. Starting at 1: 1,3,5,7,9. But 1 is not prime. So 3,5,7 are primes, 9 is composite. So three primes. 

So maybe there are only two sets where the multiple of 5 is 5 itself? But earlier, I thought starting at 11 gives a set with four primes, but that set includes 15, which is composite. Wait, no. Wait, starting at 11: 11,13,15,17,19. Here, 15 is composite, but the other numbers are primes. So that's three primes. Wait, but 11,13,17,19 are primes. So four primes? Wait, 11,13,17,19 are primes. 15 is composite. So that's four primes. Wait, but 15 is the third number. So that's four primes. So that's a set. 

Wait, so why is that? Because even though 15 is composite, the other four numbers are primes. So that's another set. So how does that fit into the previous reasoning? 

Because in this case, the multiple of 5 is 15, which is composite, but the other numbers are primes. So in that case, even though the multiple of 5 is composite, the other four numbers are primes. Therefore, that's a valid set. 

Therefore, maybe there are more sets where the multiple of 5 is composite, but the other four numbers are primes. So how can we find such sets? 

So, in order to find five consecutive odd numbers with four primes, we can have two cases: 

Case 1: The multiple of 5 is 5 itself (so it's prime), and the other four numbers are primes. 

Case 2: The multiple of 5 is a composite number (i.e., 15, 25, etc.), and the other four numbers are primes. 

So, for case 1, we need five consecutive odd numbers where one of them is 5, and the rest are primes. 

For case 2, we need five consecutive odd numbers where one of them is a multiple of 5 (composite), and the other four are primes. 

So, for case 1, starting at 3: {3,5,7,9,11} (4 primes). Starting at 5: {5,7,9,11,13} (4 primes). Starting at 7: {7,9,11,13,15} (three primes). Starting at 1: {1,3,5,7,9} (three primes). 

So maybe only two sets in case 1. 

For case 2, starting at 11: {11,13,15,17,19} (four primes). Starting at 13: {13,15,17,19,21} (three primes). Starting at 17: {17,19,21,23,25} (three primes). Starting at 19: {19,21,23,25,27} (two primes). Starting at 21: {21,23,25,27,29} (two primes). Starting at 23: {23,25,27,29,31} (three primes). Starting at 25: {25,27,29,31,33} (two primes). Starting at 27: {27,29,31,33,35} (two primes). Starting at 29: {29,31,33,35,37} (three primes). Starting at 31: {31,33,35,37,39} (two primes). 

So, only one set in case 2 so far: {11,13,15,17,19}. 

But the question asks for five such sets. So far, I have three sets: {3,5,7,9,11}, {5,7,9,11,13}, {11,13,15,17,19}. 

So I need two more. Let me think. Maybe there are more sets where the multiple of 5 is composite, but the other four numbers are primes. 

Let me check starting at 31: {31,33,35,37,39}. 31,37 are primes. 33,35,39 are composite. So two primes. 

Starting at 33: {33,35,37,39,41}. 37 and 41 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 35: {35,37,39,41,43}. 37,41,43 are primes. 35 and 39 are composite. Three primes.

Starting at 65: {65,67,69,71,73}. 67,71,73 are primes. 65,69 composite. Three primes. 

Starting at 67: {67,69,71,73,75}. 67,71,73 are primes. 69,75 composite. Three primes. 

Starting at 69: {69,71,73,75,77}. 71,73 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 71: {71,73,75,77,79}. 71,73,79 are primes. 75,77 composite. Three primes. 

Starting at 73: {73,75,77,79,81}. 73,79 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 75: {75,77,79,81,83}. 79,83 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 77: {77,79,81,83,85}. 79,83 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 79: {79,81,83,85,87}. 79,83 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 81: {81,83,85,87,89}. 83,89 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 83: {83,85,87,89,91}. 83,89 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 85: {85,87,89,91,93}. 89 is prime. Others composite. One prime. 

Starting at 87: {87,89,91,93,95}. 89 is prime. Others composite. One prime. 

Starting at 89: {89,91,93,95,97}. 89,97 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 91: {91,93,95,97,99}. 97 is prime. Others composite. One prime. 

Starting at 93: {93,95,97,99,101}. 97,101 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 95: {95,97,99,101,103}. 97,101,103 are primes. 95,99 composite. Three primes. 

Starting at 97: {97,99,101,103,105}. 97,101,103 are primes. 99,105 composite. Three primes. 

Starting at 99: {99,101,103,105,107}. 101,103,107 are primes. 99,105 composite. Three primes. 

Starting at 101: {101,103,105,107,109}. 101,103,107,109 are primes. 105 is composite. So that's four primes! So that's another set: {101,103,105,107,109}. 

Ah! There we go. So that's a fourth set. 

So here, the numbers are 101, 103, 105, 107, 109. 105 is divisible by 5 (105 = 5*21), which is composite. The other numbers: 101, 103, 107, 109 are all primes. So that's four primes. 

So that's a fourth set. 

Let me check starting at 103: {103,105,107,109,111}. 103,107,109 are primes. 105 and 111 are composite. Three primes. 

Starting at 105: {105,107,109,111,113}. 107,109,113 are primes. 105, 111 composite. Three primes. 

Starting at 107: {107,109,111,113,115}. 107,109,113 are primes. 111,115 composite. Three primes. 

Starting at 109: {109,111,113,115,117}. 109,113 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 111: {111,113,115,117,119}. 113 is prime. Others composite. One prime. 

Starting at 113: {113,115,117,119,121}. 113 is prime. Others composite. One prime. 

Starting at 115: {115,117,119,121,123}. 119 is 7*17, 121 is 11², so composite. Others composite. 

So that's not helpful. 

But earlier, starting at 101 gives a set. So that's a fourth set. 

Now, let's check starting at 199? Maybe there are more sets. But maybe I can find another one. 

Let me check starting at 199: {199, 201, 203, 205, 207}. 199 is prime. 201 is 3*67, composite. 203 is 7*29, composite. 205 is 5*41, composite. 207 is 3*69, composite. So only one prime. Not helpful. 

How about starting at 149? Let's check {149, 151, 153, 155, 157}. 149 is prime, 151 is prime, 153 is composite, 155 is composite, 157 is prime. So three primes. 

Starting at 151: {151,153,155,157,159}. 151,157 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 153: {153,155,157,159,161}. 157 is prime. Others composite. One prime. 

Starting at 155: {155,157,159,161,163}. 157,163 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 157: {157,159,161,163,165}. 157,163 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 159: {159,161,163,165,167}. 163,167 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 161: {161,163,165,167,169}. 163,167 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 163: {163,165,167,169,171}. 163,167 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 165: {165,167,169,171,173}. 167,173 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 167: {167,169,171,173,175}. 167,173 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 169: {169,171,173,175,177}. 173 is prime. Others composite. One prime. 

Starting at 171: {171,173,175,177,179}. 173,179 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 173: {173,175,177,179,181}. 173,179,181 are primes. 175,177 composite. Three primes. 

Starting at 175: {175,177,179,181,183}. 179,181 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 177: {177,179,181,183,185}. 179,181 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 179: {179,181,183,185,187}. 179,181 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 181: {181,183,185,187,189}. 181 is prime. Others composite. One prime. 

Starting at 183: {183,185,187,189,191}. 191 is prime. Others composite. One prime. 

Starting at 185: {185,187,189,191,193}. 191,193 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 187: {187,189,191,193,195}. 191,193 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 189: {189,191,193,195,197}. 191,193,197 are primes. 189,195 composite. Three primes. 

Starting at 191: {191,193,195,197,199}. 191,193,197,199 are primes. 195 is composite. So that's four primes! So that's another set: {191,193,195,197,199}. 

So that's a fifth set. 

So now, I have five sets:

1. {3,5,7,9,11}
2. {5,7,9,11,13}
3. {11,13,15,17,19}
4. {101,103,105,107,109}
5. {191,193,195,197,199}

Let me verify each of them:

1. 3,5,7,9,11: 3,5,7,11 are primes. 9 is composite. Four primes. Correct.

2. 5,7,9,11,13: 5,7,11,13 are primes. 9 is composite. Four primes. Correct.

3. 11,13,15,17,19: 11,13,17,19 are primes. 15 is composite. Four primes. Correct.

4. 101,103,105,107,109: 101,103,107,109 are primes. 105 is composite. Four primes. Correct.

5. 191,193,195,197,199: 191,193,197,199 are primes. 195 is composite. Four primes. Correct.

So that's five sets. 

But wait, let me check if there are any other sets between 11 and 101. For example, starting at 101 is the fourth set. What about starting at 17? No, earlier we saw that starting at 17 gives three primes. Starting at 19: two primes. Starting at 23: three primes. Starting at 29: three primes. Starting at 31: two primes. Starting at 37: three primes. Starting at 41: three primes. Starting at 43: two primes. Starting at 47: two primes. Starting at 53: three primes. Starting at 59: three primes. Starting at 61: two primes. Starting at 67: three primes. Starting at 71: three primes. Starting at 73: two primes. Starting at 79: two primes. Starting at 83: two primes. Starting at 89: two primes. Starting at 97: three primes. Starting at 101: four primes. Then starting at 103: three primes. Starting at 107: three primes. Starting at 109: two primes. Starting at 113: one prime. Starting at 127: let me check. 

Wait, maybe there are more sets. Let me check starting at 149? Earlier, I saw that {149, 151, 153, 155, 157} has three primes. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another set between 101 and 191? Let me check starting at 149. 

Wait, maybe starting at 199? No, as checked earlier. How about starting at 199? No. 

Alternatively, starting at 199: {199, 201, 203, 205, 207} only one prime. 

Alternatively, starting at 193: {193, 195, 197, 199, 201}. 193,197,199 are primes. 195 and 201 composite. Three primes. 

Starting at 197: {197,199,201,203,205}. 197,199 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

So no. So maybe the fifth set is the one starting at 191. 

Therefore, the five sets are as above. 

But let me check if there's another one between 101 and 191. For example, starting at 115? {115,117,119,121,123} – all composite except maybe 119? 119 is 7*17, composite. 

Starting at 121: {121,123,125,127,129}. 127 is prime. Others composite. One prime. 

Starting at 123: {123,125,127,129,131}. 127,131 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 125: {125,127,129,131,133}. 127,131 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 127: {127,129,131,133,135}. 127,131 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 129: {129,131,133,135,137}. 131,137 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 131: {131,133,135,137,139}. 131,137,139 are primes. 133,135 composite. Three primes. 

Starting at 133: {133,135,137,139,141}. 137,139 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 135: {135,137,139,141,143}. 137,139 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 137: {137,139,141,143,145}. 137,139 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 139: {139,141,143,145,147}. 139 is prime. Others composite. One prime. 

Starting at 141: {141,143,145,147,149}. 149 is prime. Others composite. One prime. 

Starting at 143: {143,145,147,149,151}. 149,151 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 145: {145,147,149,151,153}. 149,151 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 147: {147,149,151,153,155}. 149,151 are primes. Others composite. Two primes. 

Starting at 149: {149,151,153,155,157}. 149,151,157 are primes. 153,155 composite. Three primes. 

So, no, between 101 and 191, only the set starting at 191 gives four primes. 

Therefore, the five sets I found are:

1. {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}
2. {5, 7, 9, 11, 13}
3. {11, 13, 15, 17, 19}
4. {101, 103, 105, 107, 109}
5. {191, 193, 195, 197, 199}

Therefore, these five sets satisfy the condition of having four primes among five consecutive odd integers.

**Final Answer**
The five sets are \boxed{\{3, 5, 7, 9, 11\}}, \boxed{\{5, 7, 9, 11, 13\}}, \boxed{\{11, 13, 15, 17, 19\}}, \boxed{\{101, 103, 105, 107, 109\}}, and \boxed{\{191, 193, 195, 197, 199\}}.

To solve the problem, we are asked to find **five sets of five consecutive odd integers** where **four of them are prime numbers**.

### Understanding the Structure

A set of five consecutive odd integers can be written in the form:

$$
\{n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8\}
$$

Each of these numbers is odd. Among these five numbers, **four must be prime**, and the fifth must be **composite** (i.e., not prime).

---

### Strategy

1. **Check small odd numbers** to find sets where four of the five numbers are prime.
2. **Identify the composite number** in each such set, which must be a multiple of 5 (since in any five consecutive odd numbers, one is divisible by 5).
3. **Verify that the other four are prime**.
4. **Continue checking higher values** to find more such sets.

   - Primes: 3, 5, 7, 11  
   - Composite: 9  
   - ✅ Four primes

2. **{5, 7, 9, 11, 13}**  
   - Primes: 5, 7, 11, 13  
   - Composite: 9  
   - ✅ Four primes

3. **{11, 13, 15, 17, 19}**  
   - Primes: 11, 13, 17, 19  
   - Composite: 15  
   - ✅ Four primes

4. **{101, 103, 105, 107, 109}**  
   - Primes: 101, 103, 107, 109  
   - Composite: 105  
   - ✅ Four primes

5. **{191, 193, 195, 197, 199}**
