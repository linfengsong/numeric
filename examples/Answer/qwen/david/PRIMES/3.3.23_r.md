Okay, so I need to figure out these two problems about twin primes and their means. Let me start with part (a). 

First, let me recall what twin primes are. Twin primes are pairs of primes that are two apart. So, like (3,5), (5,7), (11,13), etc. The arithmetic mean of a pair of numbers is just their average. For example, the mean of 5 and 7 is (5+7)/2 = 6, which is a triangular number. A triangular number is a number that can be represented as n(n+1)/2 for some integer n. So 6 is the third triangular number because 3*4/2 = 6. 

The question is asking if there are any other twin primes where their arithmetic mean is also a triangular number. So I need to check if there are other twin prime pairs where (p + (p+2))/2 is a triangular number. Let me write that down.

Let me denote the twin primes as p and p+2. Their mean is (p + (p + 2))/2 = (2p + 2)/2 = p + 1. So the mean is p + 1. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding twin primes p and p+2 such that p + 1 is a triangular number. 

So, for example, in the case of 5 and 7, p is 5, so p + 1 = 6, which is triangular. So we need to find other primes p where p + 1 is triangular. 

So maybe I can approach this by first generating triangular numbers and then checking if p = triangular number - 1 is a prime, and then checking if p + 2 is also a prime. 

Alternatively, since triangular numbers are given by T_n = n(n+1)/2, so p + 1 = T_n. Therefore, p = T_n - 1. Then p must be prime, and p + 2 must also be prime. 

So let me try to generate some triangular numbers and check.

First, let's list some triangular numbers:

T_1 = 1(2)/2 = 1

T_2 = 2(3)/2 = 3

T_3 = 3(4)/2 = 6

T_4 = 4(5)/2 = 10

T_5 = 5(6)/2 = 15

T_6 = 6(7)/2 = 21

T_7 = 7(8)/2 = 28

T_8 = 8(9)/2 = 36

T_9 = 9(10)/2 = 45

T_10 = 10(11)/2 = 55

T_11 = 11(12)/2 = 66

T_12 = 12(13)/2 = 78

T_13 = 13(14)/2 = 91

T_14 = 14(15)/2 = 105

T_15 = 15(16)/2 = 120

T_16 = 16(17)/2 = 136

T_17 = 17(18)/2 = 153

T_18 = 18(19)/2 = 171

T_19 = 19(20)/2 = 190

T_20 = 20(21)/2 = 210

Okay, so now for each of these triangular numbers T_n, let's compute p = T_n - 1 and check if p is prime, and p + 2 is also prime.

Starting with T_1 = 1: p = 0, not prime.

T_2 = 3: p = 2, which is prime. Then p + 2 = 4, which is not prime. So (2,4) isn't a twin prime pair because 4 isn't prime.

T_3 = 6: p = 5, which is prime. p + 2 = 7, which is prime. So that's the case given in the problem, (5,7). 

T_4 = 10: p = 9, which is not prime.

T_5 = 15: p = 14, not prime.

T_6 = 21: p = 20, not prime.

T_7 = 28: p = 27, not prime.

T_8 = 36: p = 35, not prime.

T_9 = 45: p = 44, not prime.

T_10 = 55: p = 54, not prime.

T_11 = 66: p = 65, not prime.

T_12 = 78: p = 77, not prime.

T_13 = 91: p = 90, not prime.

T_14 = 105: p = 104, not prime.

T_15 = 120: p = 119, which is 17*7, not prime.

T_16 = 136: p = 135, not prime.

T_17 = 153: p = 152, not prime.

T_18 = 171: p = 170, not prime.

T_19 = 190: p = 189, not prime.

T_20 = 210: p = 209, which is 11*19, not prime.

So up to T_20, only T_3 gives us a valid twin prime pair (5,7). Let me check if there are any more beyond that. But maybe there's a way to prove that there are no more?

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think.

We have that p + 1 = T_n = n(n + 1)/2. Therefore, p = n(n + 1)/2 - 1. So p must be prime, and p + 2 = n(n + 1)/2 + 1 must also be prime.

So let me write that:

p = [n(n + 1)/2] - 1

p + 2 = [n(n + 1)/2] + 1

So, for p and p + 2 to be primes, both [n(n + 1)/2 - 1] and [n(n + 1)/2 + 1] must be primes.

So, let me denote m = n(n + 1)/2. Then, m - 1 and m + 1 must be primes. So, m - 1 and m + 1 are twin primes. Wait, but m is a triangular number. So, m is a triangular number, and m - 1 and m + 1 are twin primes? Wait, but in our case, p = m - 1 and p + 2 = m + 1. So, m - 1 and m + 1 are twin primes? Wait, twin primes are two primes differing by 2. So, m - 1 and m + 1 differ by 2. Therefore, if m - 1 and m + 1 are primes, then they are twin primes. Therefore, the question becomes: are there any triangular numbers m such that m - 1 and m + 1 are twin primes?

But in our case, m is T_n, so the triangular numbers. So we need to find triangular numbers m where m - 1 and m + 1 are twin primes. 

But in our earlier check, we saw that only for m = 6 (T_3) we have m - 1 = 5 and m + 1 = 7, which are twin primes. 

So maybe there are no others? Let me check for higher n.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical way to show that only m = 6 satisfies this.

Let me think about the equation:

Let me write that m - 1 and m + 1 are twin primes. So, m - 1 and m + 1 are primes. Therefore, m must be even, because if m - 1 and m + 1 are both primes, then m must be even. Because if m is odd, then m - 1 and m + 1 are even numbers, which can only be prime if they are 2. But m - 1 and m + 1 differ by 2. So, if m is odd, then m - 1 and m + 1 are both even. The only even prime is 2. Therefore, m - 1 = 2 and m + 1 = 4, but 4 is not prime. Therefore, m cannot be odd. Therefore, m must be even. Therefore, m is even. 

But m is a triangular number. So, T_n = n(n + 1)/2. So, T_n is even if and only if n ≡ 0 or 3 mod 4. Wait, let me think. 

The triangular numbers are T_n = n(n + 1)/2. So, n and n + 1 are consecutive integers, so one of them is even. Therefore, T_n is always an integer. Now, whether it is even or odd depends on n. 

If n is even: Let n = 2k. Then T_n = 2k*(2k + 1)/2 = k*(2k + 1). So, if k is even, then T_n is even. If k is odd, then T_n is odd. 

If n is odd: Let n = 2k + 1. Then T_n = (2k + 1)(2k + 2)/2 = (2k + 1)(k + 1). So, if k + 1 is even, then T_n is even. If k + 1 is odd, then T_n is odd. 

So, T_n is even when either n is even and k is even (so n = 2k, k even => n divisible by 4), or when n is odd and k + 1 is even (so n = 2k + 1, k + 1 even => k is odd => n = 2*(2m - 1) + 1 = 4m - 2 + 1 = 4m - 1). Therefore, T_n is even when n ≡ 0 or 3 mod 4. 

But since we need m = T_n to be even, so n ≡ 0 or 3 mod 4. 

But in our case, m is even, so m - 1 and m + 1 are odd numbers. Therefore, they can be primes (except for 2). 

But in our case, m - 1 and m + 1 are twin primes. So, for example, m = 6 (T_3) gives 5 and 7. Let's check for higher n. 

But maybe we can find some constraints. Let me think. 

Since m - 1 and m + 1 are twin primes, then m must be between two primes. Also, since m is a triangular number, maybe we can find some equations. 

Alternatively, since m = T_n, and m - 1 and m + 1 are primes. Let me think about the equation:

Let me denote m = T_n = n(n + 1)/2. So, m - 1 = n(n + 1)/2 - 1, and m + 1 = n(n + 1)/2 + 1. 

We need both of these to be primes. Let me check for n = 3: 3*4/2 = 6, so m - 1 = 5, m + 1 = 7, primes. 

For n = 4: T_4 = 10. m - 1 = 9 (not prime), m + 1 = 11 (prime). Not both primes. 

n = 5: T_5 = 15. m - 1 = 14 (not prime), m + 1 = 16 (not prime). 

n = 6: T_6 = 21. m - 1 = 20 (not prime), m + 1 = 22 (not prime). 

n = 7: T_7 = 28. m - 1 = 27 (not prime), m + 1 = 29 (prime). 

n = 8: T_8 = 36. m - 1 = 35 (not prime), m + 1 = 37 (prime). 

n = 9: T_9 = 45. m - 1 = 44 (not prime), m + 1 = 46 (not prime). 

n = 10: T_10 = 55. m - 1 = 54 (not prime), m + 1 = 56 (not prime). 

n = 11: T_11 = 66. m - 1 = 65 (not prime), m + 1 = 67 (prime). 

n = 12: T_12 = 78. m - 1 = 77 (not prime), m + 1 = 79 (prime). 

n = 13: T_13 = 91. m - 1 = 90 (not prime), m + 1 = 92 (not prime). 

n = 14: T_14 = 105. m - 1 = 104 (not prime), m + 1 = 106 (not prime). 

n = 15: T_15 = 120. m - 1 = 119 (not prime), m + 1 = 121 (not prime). 

n = 16: T_16 = 136. m - 1 = 135 (not prime), m + 1 = 137 (prime). 

n = 17: T_17 = 153. m - 1 = 152 (not prime), m + 1 = 154 (not prime). 

n = 18: T_18 = 171. m - 1 = 170 (not prime), m + 1 = 172 (not prime). 

n = 19: T_19 = 190. m - 1 = 189 (not prime), m + 1 = 191 (prime). 

n = 20: T_20 = 210. m - 1 = 209 (not prime), m + 1 = 211 (prime). 

So, looking at these, only n = 3 gives both m - 1 and m + 1 as primes. For other n, only one of them is prime. 

But maybe there's a higher n where both m - 1 and m + 1 are primes? How can I check?

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical reason why this can't happen. Let me think.

Suppose that m - 1 and m + 1 are primes. Then, m must be even, as we saw. Also, m - 1 and m + 1 are two apart, so they are twin primes. Therefore, m is between two twin primes. 

But m is a triangular number. So, maybe we can find some constraints on m. 

Alternatively, since m = T_n = n(n + 1)/2, and m - 1 and m + 1 are primes, then:

Let me consider m - 1 = p and m + 1 = p + 2, which are twin primes. Therefore, p = T_n - 1 and p + 2 = T_n + 1. 

But p and p + 2 are primes. So, for p to be prime, T_n - 1 must be prime. Also, T_n + 1 must be prime. 

But maybe we can think about the properties of T_n. 

Alternatively, maybe we can look for solutions to the equation:

T_n - 1 and T_n + 1 are both primes. 

But since T_n is a triangular number, which is n(n + 1)/2. 

Alternatively, since T_n is even, as we saw, then n ≡ 0 or 3 mod 4. 

But even so, how can we find if there are other solutions? 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to show that for n ≥ 4, T_n - 1 or T_n + 1 is divisible by some small prime, making them non-prime. 

For example, let's check for n ≥ 4. 

Let me take n = 4: T_4 = 10. 10 - 1 = 9, which is 3^2. Not prime. 

n = 5: T_5 = 15. 15 - 1 = 14, which is 2*7. Not prime. 

n = 6: 21 - 1 = 20, 2*2*5. Not prime. 

n = 7: 28 - 1 = 27 = 3^3. Not prime. 

n = 8: 36 - 1 = 35 = 5*7. Not prime. 

n = 9: 45 - 1 = 44 = 4*11. Not prime. 

n = 10: 55 - 1 = 54 = 6*9. Not prime. 

n = 11: 66 - 1 = 65 = 5*13. Not prime. 

n = 12: 78 - 1 = 77 = 7*11. Not prime. 

n = 13: 91 - 1 = 90 = 9*10. Not prime. 

n = 14: 105 - 1 = 104 = 8*13. Not prime. 

n = 15: 120 - 1 = 119 = 7*17. Not prime. 

n = 16: 136 - 1 = 135 = 5*27. Not prime. 

n = 17: 153 - 1 = 152 = 8*19. Not prime. 

n = 18: 171 - 1 = 170 = 10*17. Not prime. 

n = 19: 190 - 1 = 189 = 9*21. Not prime. 

n = 20: 210 - 1 = 209 = 11*19. Not prime. 

So, for n ≥ 4, T_n - 1 is composite. Similarly, T_n + 1 is sometimes prime, but not both. 

But maybe for larger n? Let's check n = 21: T_21 = 21*22/2 = 231. T_21 - 1 = 230, which is even, not prime. T_21 + 1 = 232, even, not prime. 

n = 22: T_22 = 22*23/2 = 253. T_22 - 1 = 252, even. T_22 + 1 = 254, even. 

n = 23: T_23 = 23*24/2 = 276. T_23 - 1 = 275 = 5*55. Not prime. T_23 + 1 = 277. Let me check if 277 is prime. 277 divided by 2? No. Divided by 3? 2+7+7=16, not divisible by 3. Divided by 5? Ends with 7. 7? 277/7 ≈ 39.57. 7*39 = 273, 277-273=4. Not divisible by 7. 11? 2 - 7 + 7 = 2, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*21 = 273, 277-273=4. Not divisible by 13. 17? 17*16 = 272, 277-272=5. Not divisible by 17. 19? 19*14=266, 277-266=11. Not divisible by 19. 23? 23*12=276, 277-276=1. Not divisible by 23. So 277 is prime. But T_23 - 1 = 275 is not prime. So only one of them is prime. 

n = 24: T_24 = 24*25/2 = 300. T_24 - 1 = 299. Let's check 299. 299 divided by 13 is 23, because 13*23 = 299. So not prime. T_24 + 1 = 301. 301 divided by 7 is 43, 7*43=301. Not prime. 

n = 25: T_25 = 25*26/2 = 325. T_25 - 1 = 324, even. T_25 + 1 = 326, even. 

n = 26: T_26 = 26*27/2 = 351. T_26 - 1 = 350, even. T_26 + 1 = 352, even. 

n = 27: T_27 = 27*28/2 = 378. T_27 - 1 = 377. Let me check 377. Divided by 13: 13*29 = 377. Not prime. T_27 + 1 = 379. Let me check 379. Divided by 2? No. 3? 3+7+9=19, not divisible by 3. 5? No. 7? 7*54=378, 379-378=1. Not divisible by 7. 11? 3 - 7 + 9 = 5, not divisible by 11. 13? 13*29 = 377, 13*29 + 2 = 379. Not divisible by 13. 17? 17*22 = 374, 379 - 374 = 5. Not divisible. 19? 19*19 = 361, 19*20=380. So no. So 379 is prime. But T_27 - 1 = 377 is not prime. 

n = 28: T_28 = 28*29/2 = 406. T_28 - 1 = 405, which is divisible by 5. T_28 + 1 = 407. Let me check 407. Divided by 11: 11*37 = 407. So not prime. 

n = 29: T_29 = 29*30/2 = 435. T_29 - 1 = 434, even. T_29 + 1 = 436, even. 

n = 30: T_30 = 30*31/2 = 465. T_30 - 1 = 464, even. T_30 + 1 = 466, even. 

So, even as n increases, it seems that T_n - 1 is often composite, and T_n + 1 is sometimes prime, but not both. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical reason why this can't happen. Let me think about the properties of triangular numbers. 

Since T_n = n(n + 1)/2. If n is even, say n = 2k, then T_n = k(2k + 1). If n is odd, say n = 2k + 1, then T_n = (2k + 1)(k + 1). 

So, if n is even, then T_n is k*(2k + 1). If n is odd, T_n is (2k + 1)*(k + 1). 

In either case, T_n is a product of two numbers. 

But when we look at T_n - 1 and T_n + 1, they are primes. 

But for T_n - 1 to be prime, since T_n is either k*(2k + 1) or (2k + 1)*(k + 1), then T_n - 1 is either k*(2k + 1) - 1 or (2k + 1)*(k + 1) - 1. 

But maybe we can analyze these expressions. 

Let me take n even first. Let n = 2k. Then T_n = k*(2k + 1). Then T_n - 1 = k*(2k + 1) - 1. 

Similarly, T_n + 1 = k*(2k + 1) + 1. 

Similarly, for n odd, n = 2k + 1. Then T_n = (2k + 1)*(k + 1). Then T_n - 1 = (2k + 1)*(k + 1) - 1, and T_n + 1 = (2k + 1)*(k + 1) + 1. 

But I don't see an immediate way to factor these expressions. However, maybe we can check for divisibility by small primes. 

For example, for T_n - 1, when n is even: Let's take n = 2k. Then T_n - 1 = 2k^2 + k - 1. 

Let me factor this quadratic: 2k² + k - 1. Let me check if it factors. 

Looking for factors of (2k² + k - 1). Let me try to factor it. 

Looking for two numbers a and b such that a * b = 2*(-1) = -2 and a + b = 1 (the coefficient of k). 

So, possible pairs: 2 and -1. 2 + (-1) = 1. 

Therefore, 2k² + 2k - k - 1 = 2k(k + 1) - 1(k + 1) = (2k - 1)(k + 1). 

Wait, let me check:

(2k - 1)(k + 1) = 2k(k) + 2k(1) - 1(k) -1(1) = 2k² + 2k - k - 1 = 2k² + k - 1. Yes! 

Therefore, T_n - 1 = (2k - 1)(k + 1) when n is even (n = 2k). 

So, for n even, T_n - 1 factors into (2k - 1)(k + 1). Therefore, unless one of these factors is 1, T_n - 1 is composite. 

So, for T_n - 1 to be prime, one of the factors must be 1. 

Case 1: 2k - 1 = 1 => 2k = 2 => k = 1. Then n = 2k = 2. Then T_n - 1 = 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Which is prime. 

Case 2: k + 1 = 1 => k = 0. Then n = 0, which is not a valid case since n must be positive integer. 

Therefore, the only case when T_n - 1 is prime when n is even is when n = 2. 

But n = 2: T_2 = 3. Then T_2 - 1 = 2, which is prime. Then T_2 + 1 = 4, which is not prime. Therefore, only one of them is prime. 

Therefore, for even n ≥ 4, T_n - 1 is composite. 

Now, for n odd, let me consider n = 2k + 1. Then T_n = (2k + 1)(k + 1). Therefore, T_n - 1 = (2k + 1)(k + 1) - 1. Let me expand that:

(2k + 1)(k + 1) - 1 = 2k(k + 1) + 1*(k + 1) - 1 = 2k² + 2k + k + 1 - 1 = 2k² + 3k. 

So, T_n - 1 = 2k² + 3k = k(2k + 3). 

Similarly, T_n + 1 = (2k + 1)(k + 1) + 1 = 2k² + 3k + 1. 

Let me check if this can be factored. 

Looking at 2k² + 3k + 1. Let me try to factor it. 

Looking for factors of 2*1 = 2 that add up to 3. 2 and 1. 

So, 2k² + 2k + k + 1 = 2k(k + 1) + 1(k + 1) = (2k + 1)(k + 1). 

Therefore, T_n + 1 = (2k + 1)(k + 1). 

So, for n odd, T_n - 1 = k(2k + 3) and T_n + 1 = (2k + 1)(k + 1). 

Therefore, for T_n - 1 to be prime, since it's k*(2k + 3), then again, one of the factors must be 1. 

Case 1: k = 1. Then T_n - 1 = 1*(2*1 + 3) = 5. Which is prime. 

Case 2: 2k + 3 = 1 => 2k = -2 => k = -1. Not valid. 

Therefore, only when k = 1, which corresponds to n = 2k + 1 = 3. Therefore, n = 3. 

So, for n odd, the only case when T_n - 1 is prime is when n = 3. 

Therefore, combining both cases, the only n where T_n - 1 is prime is n = 2 and n = 3. 

For n = 2, T_n - 1 = 2, which is prime, but T_n + 1 = 4, not prime. 

For n = 3, T_n - 1 = 5, which is prime, and T_n + 1 = 7, which is prime. 

Therefore, only for n = 3, we have both T_n - 1 and T_n + 1 as primes. Therefore, the only twin primes with triangular mean are (5,7). 

Therefore, the answer to part (a) is no, there are no other twin primes with a triangular mean. 

Now, moving on to part (b). 

The question is: The arithmetic mean of the twin primes 3 and 5 is the perfect square 4. Are there any other twin primes with a square mean?

So, similar to part (a), but now the mean should be a perfect square. 

Again, twin primes p and p + 2. Their mean is (p + (p + 2))/2 = p + 1. So, similar to part (a), the mean is p + 1. Therefore, we need p + 1 to be a perfect square. 

So, p + 1 = k² for some integer k. Therefore, p = k² - 1. Then p + 2 = k² + 1. 

So, we need both p = k² - 1 and p + 2 = k² + 1 to be primes. 

So, let me check for k such that k² - 1 and k² + 1 are primes. 

First, note that k² - 1 factors as (k - 1)(k + 1). Therefore, unless one of the factors is 1, this product is composite. 

So, for k² - 1 to be prime, one of (k - 1) or (k + 1) must be 1. 

Case 1: k - 1 = 1 => k = 2. Then k² - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3, which is prime. Then k² + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5, which is prime. Therefore, p = 3 and p + 2 = 5, which are twin primes. 

Case 2: k + 1 = 1 => k = 0. Then k² - 1 = -1, which is not prime. 

Therefore, the only case when k² - 1 is prime is when k = 2. 

But wait, what if k is larger? For example, suppose k is such that k² - 1 is prime. But since k² - 1 = (k - 1)(k + 1), unless one of the factors is 1, it's composite. Therefore, for k ≥ 3, (k - 1) ≥ 2 and (k + 1) ≥ 4, so their product is composite. Therefore, k² - 1 is composite for k ≥ 3. 

Therefore, the only possible k is 2, giving p = 3 and p + 2 = 5. 

But wait, let me check for k = 1. Then p = 1² - 1 = 0, not prime. 

k = 0: p = -1, not prime. 

k = 2: p = 3, which is prime. 

k = 3: p = 9 - 1 = 8, not prime. 

k = 4: 16 - 1 = 15, not prime. 

k = 5: 25 - 1 = 24, not prime. 

k = 6: 36 - 1 = 35, not prime. 

So, indeed, only k = 2 gives p = 3. 

But wait, let me check for k = 1. If k = 1, p = 0, not prime. 

But what about k = something else? For example, if k is negative? Well, k² is same as positive, so k = -2 would give same result. 

Therefore, the only solution is k = 2. 

Therefore, the only twin primes with square mean are (3,5). 

But wait, let me check if there are any other twin primes where p + 1 is a square. 

For example, take p = 5, then p + 1 = 6, not square. 

p = 7, p + 1 = 8, not square. 

p = 11, p + 1 = 12, not square. 

p = 13, 14, not square. 

p = 17, 18, nope. 

p = 19, 20. 

p = 29, 30. 

p = 31, 32. 

p = 41, 42. 

p = 43, 44. 

p = 59, 60. 

p = 61, 62. 

So none of these are squares. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a case where p + 1 is square, but p is not of the form k² - 1? Wait, no. Because p + 1 is square, so p = square - 1. Therefore, the only possible case is when p = k² - 1. 

Therefore, only k = 2 gives p = 3, which is prime. Therefore, only (3,5). 

But wait, let me think again. Suppose that p + 1 is a square, but p is not k² - 1. Wait, no, p + 1 is a square, so p = square - 1. Therefore, p must be of that form. 

Therefore, the only possible case is when k = 2. 

Therefore, the answer to part (b) is no, there are no other twin primes with a square mean. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k = 2: p = 3, p + 2 = 5. 

What about k = something else? For example, if k = 2, then p + 1 = 4. 

But suppose someone says, for example, p = 2, p + 2 = 4. But 4 is not prime. 

Or p = 5, p + 1 = 6, not square. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way? Let me think. 

Suppose that p + 1 is a square, say m². Then p = m² - 1. Then p + 2 = m² + 1. 

So, we need both m² - 1 and m² + 1 to be primes. 

But m² - 1 = (m - 1)(m + 1). For this to be prime, one of the factors must be 1. 

So, as before, m - 1 = 1 => m = 2. Then m² - 1 = 3, prime. m² + 1 = 5, prime. 

Or m + 1 = 1 => m = 0, which gives m² - 1 = -1, not prime. 

Therefore, only m = 2. 

Therefore, no other solutions. 

Therefore, the answer is no, there are no other twin primes with a square mean. 

But wait, let me check if there are any other cases where m² - 1 is prime, even if m - 1 or m + 1 is not 1. For example, if m is 2, then m² - 1 is 3. If m is 3, m² - 1 = 8, not prime. m = 4: 15, not prime. m = 5: 24, not prime. So no. 

Therefore, the only solution is m = 2. 

Therefore, the answer to part (b) is no. 

But wait, hold on. What about m = 1? Then m² - 1 = 0, not prime. 

So, indeed, only m = 2. 

Therefore, the answer is no, there are no other twin primes with a square mean. 

But wait, the question says "the arithmetic mean of the twin primes 3 and 5 is the perfect square 4." So they are saying that (3 + 5)/2 = 4, which is a square. So the question is whether there are any other twin primes where their mean is a square. 

So according to our analysis, no. 

But let me check for larger numbers. For example, suppose there exists a twin prime pair where p + 1 is a square. Let me suppose that p + 1 = m². Then p = m² - 1. Then p + 2 = m² + 1. 

So, for example, if m² + 1 is prime. For example, m = 2: 5 is prime. m = 4: 17 is prime. Wait, m = 4: p = 16 - 1 = 15, which is not prime. So even though m² + 1 is prime, p is not. 

Similarly, m = 6: m² + 1 = 37, prime. p = 36 - 1 = 35, not prime. 

m = 8: m² + 1 = 65, not prime. 

m = 10: m² + 1 = 101, prime. p = 100 - 1 = 99, not prime. 

m = 12: m² + 1 = 145, not prime. 

m = 14: 197, prime. p = 196 - 1 = 195, not prime. 

So, even though m² + 1 is prime, p is not. Therefore, even if m² + 1 is prime, unless m² - 1 is also prime, which only occurs when m = 2. 

Therefore, the only case is m = 2. 

Therefore, the answer is no. 

So, both parts (a) and (b) have no other solutions. 

But let me check once again for part (a). The question says that the mean of 5 and 7 is 6, which is triangular. Are there others? 

We saw that only n = 3 gives T_n = 6, which leads to p = 5 and p + 2 = 7. 

But what about twin primes where the mean is a triangular number, but not necessarily p + 1? Wait, no, the mean is (p + (p + 2))/2 = p + 1. So the mean is p + 1. Therefore, if p + 1 is triangular, then we have the case. 

Therefore, only for p + 1 = 6, which is T_3. 

So, no others. 

Therefore, the answers are:

(a) No, there are no other twin primes with a triangular mean.

(b) No, there are no other twin primes with a square mean.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{No} (There are no other twin primes with a triangular mean.)

(b) \boxed{No} (There are no other twin primes with a square mean.)

### Part (a): Twin Primes with a Triangular Mean

We are given that the arithmetic mean of the twin primes 5 and 7 is 6, which is a triangular number. A **triangular number** is defined as:

$$
T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

The arithmetic mean of twin primes $ p $ and $ p+2 $ is:

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{p + (p+2)}{2} = p + 1
$$

Thus, for the mean to be a triangular number, $ p + 1 $ must be a triangular number. That is:

$$
p + 1 = T_n \Rightarrow p = T_n - 1
$$

We now look for values of $ n $ such that $ T_n - 1 $ is a prime number, and $ T_n + 1 = p + 2 $ is also a prime number (to ensure that $ p $ and $ p+2 $ are twin primes).

Let’s generate triangular numbers and test this condition:

- $ T_1 = 1 $, $ T_1 - 1 = 0 $ (not prime)
- $ T_2 = 3 $, $ T_2 - 1 = 2 $ (prime), $ T_2 + 1 = 4 $ (not prime)
- $ T_3 = 6 $, $ T_3 - 1 = 5 $ (prime), $ T_3 + 1 = 7 $ (prime) → Valid twin primes (5, 7)
- $ T_4 = 10 $, $ T_4 - 1 = 9 $ (not prime)
- $ T_5 = 15 $, $ T_5 - 1 = 14 $ (not prime)
- $ T_6 = 21 $, $ T_6 - 1 = 20 $ (not prime)
- $ T_7 = 28 $, $ T_7 - 1 = 27 $ (not prime)
- $ T_8 = 36 $, $ T_8 - 1 = 35 $ (not prime)
- $ T_9 = 45 $, $ T_9 -
