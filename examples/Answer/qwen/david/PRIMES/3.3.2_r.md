Okay, so I need to solve these two problems about twin primes. Let me start with part (a). The question says: If 1 is added to a product of twin primes, prove that a perfect square is always obtained. Hmm. Twin primes are primes that are two apart, like 3 and 5, 5 and 7, 11 and 13, etc. So if I take two twin primes, multiply them together, and then add 1, the result should be a perfect square. Let me try with some examples first to get a feel for it.

Take the first twin primes: 3 and 5. Their product is 3*5 = 15. Adding 1 gives 16, which is 4 squared. Okay, that works. Next pair: 5 and 7. 5*7 = 35. 35 + 1 = 36, which is 6 squared. Nice. Next pair: 11 and 13. 11*13 = 143. 143 + 1 = 144, which is 12 squared. Hmm, that's also a perfect square. Let me check another one. 17 and 19. 17*19 = 323. 323 + 1 = 324. 324 is 18 squared. Yep, that works too. So it seems like this is always true. Now I need to prove it in general.

Let me think. Let’s denote the twin primes as p and p+2. So their product is p(p+2). Adding 1 gives p(p+2) + 1. I need to show that this is a perfect square. Let me compute p(p+2) + 1. Expanding that, it's p² + 2p + 1. Wait, that's (p + 1)². Oh! So p(p+2) + 1 = (p + 1)². Therefore, it's a perfect square. Wait, is that right? Let me check with the first example. p = 3. Then (3 + 1)² = 16, which is 3*5 + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16. Correct. Similarly, p = 5: (5 + 1)² = 36, which is 5*7 + 1 = 35 + 1 = 36. Yep. So that seems to hold. Therefore, the product of twin primes p and p+2, plus 1, is (p + 1) squared, which is a perfect square. Therefore, the statement is proven.

Wait, but is there a case where this might not hold? Let me think. Suppose p is 2. But 2 and 3 are twin primes. Let me check. 2*3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7, which is not a perfect square. But the problem says "twin primes", and if p > 3? Wait, the problem says "provided that p > 3" in part (b). But part (a) doesn't have that condition. However, 2 and 3 are twin primes, but adding 1 gives 7, which is not a square. So maybe the problem assumes that the twin primes are greater than 3? Or is there something wrong here?

Wait, but 2 and 3 are twin primes. However, if we take p = 2, then p + 2 = 4, which is not prime. Wait, hold on. Wait, twin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 2. So the pair (2, 3) is twin primes, but 3 and 5 are twin primes. However, if we take p = 2, then p + 2 = 4, which is not prime. Therefore, the twin primes must be such that both p and p + 2 are primes. Therefore, in the case of p = 2, p + 2 is 4, which is not prime, so (2, 3) is actually a twin prime pair, but here p is 3? Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, if we have twin primes, they can be written as (p, p + 2). So if p = 3, then p + 2 = 5, which is prime. If p = 2, then p + 2 = 4, which is not prime. Therefore, the twin prime pair (2, 3) is actually p = 2 and p + 2 = 3, but since 3 is prime. However, in this case, p = 2, and p + 2 = 3. Then the product is 2*3 = 6. Adding 1 gives 7, which is not a square. Therefore, this seems like a counterexample. But the problem says "twin primes", so maybe the problem is considering twin primes where both are greater than 2? Or maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning?

Wait, but according to the problem statement, part (a) says "a product of twin primes". If the twin primes are (2, 3), then their product is 6, adding 1 gives 7, which is not a square. So why does the problem say "prove that a perfect square is always obtained"? That seems contradictory. Therefore, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the problem is referring to twin primes where both primes are greater than 2? But twin primes can be (3,5), (5,7), etc. But (2,3) is a twin prime pair. However, in that case, the product plus 1 is not a square. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that the twin primes are both odd primes, which would mean that p is an odd prime, so p ≥ 3. Therefore, the problem might implicitly assume that p is an odd prime. However, the problem statement doesn't specify that. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in my previous reasoning?

Wait, but in the case of twin primes (p, p + 2), if p is 3, then p + 2 is 5, which is prime. Then p(p + 2) + 1 = 3*5 + 1 = 16 = 4². Similarly, if p is 5, then 5*7 + 1 = 36 = 6². So if p is an odd prime, then p is odd, so p + 2 is also odd. Therefore, their product is odd*odd = odd. Adding 1 gives even. But (p + 1)² is (odd + 1)² = even², which is even. So that works. However, if p is 2, then p + 2 is 4, which is not prime. Therefore, the twin primes must be such that p is an odd prime, so that p + 2 is also an odd prime. Therefore, the problem might be assuming that the twin primes are greater than 2, so that p is odd. Therefore, in that case, the formula p(p + 2) + 1 = (p + 1)^2 holds. Therefore, the answer is correct. Therefore, maybe the problem is considering twin primes where both are greater than 2, so that p is odd, so that p + 2 is also odd. Therefore, the problem is correct. Therefore, the answer is that p(p + 2) + 1 = (p + 1)^2, which is a perfect square. Therefore, part (a) is proven.

But just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other cases. For example, take p = 3, which is odd. Then p + 2 = 5, which is prime. Then the product is 15, plus 1 is 16. For p = 5, 5*7 + 1 = 36. For p = 11, 11*13 + 1 = 143 + 1 = 144 = 12². So that works. Therefore, the formula holds. Therefore, the answer is correct.

Therefore, part (a) is proven by showing that p(p + 2) + 1 equals (p + 1)^2, which is a perfect square.

Now moving on to part (b): Show that the sum of twin primes p and p + 2 is divisible by 12, provided that p > 3.

So, given twin primes p and p + 2, where p > 3, show that p + (p + 2) is divisible by 12. So, the sum is 2p + 2. Therefore, 2(p + 1). Therefore, we need to show that 2(p + 1) is divisible by 12, which implies that p + 1 is divisible by 6. Therefore, p + 1 must be a multiple of 6. Therefore, p must be congruent to 5 mod 6, since p + 1 ≡ 0 mod 6 => p ≡ -1 mod 6 => p ≡ 5 mod 6.

But why is p ≡ 5 mod 6? Let's think. Since p is a prime greater than 3, it must be odd. Also, primes greater than 3 are either 1 or 5 mod 6. Because primes cannot be divisible by 2 or 3. So, if p is a prime greater than 3, then p is odd, so p is 1 or 5 mod 6. Let me check. If p is 1 mod 6, then p + 1 is 2 mod 6. If p is 5 mod 6, then p + 1 is 0 mod 6. Therefore, if p is 5 mod 6, then p + 1 is divisible by 6, so 2(p + 1) is divisible by 12. Therefore, if p is 5 mod 6, then 2(p + 1) is divisible by 12. Therefore, we need to show that for twin primes p and p + 2, p is 5 mod 6.

But why is p 5 mod 6? Let's think about twin primes. If p is a prime greater than 3, then p is odd, so p is either 1 or 5 mod 6. Let's consider the twin primes p and p + 2. If p is 1 mod 6, then p + 2 is 3 mod 6. But 3 mod 6 is 3, which is not prime (unless p + 2 is 3, but p would be 1, which is not prime). Wait, but if p is 1 mod 6, then p + 2 is 3 mod 6. However, 3 mod 6 is 3, which is prime only if p + 2 = 3. But if p is a prime greater than 3, then p + 2 is at least 5 + 2 = 7. Therefore, p + 2 cannot be 3. Therefore, if p is 1 mod 6, then p + 2 is 3 mod 6, which is 3, but since p + 2 is greater than 3, it would be divisible by 3, hence not prime. Therefore, p cannot be 1 mod 6. Therefore, p must be 5 mod 6. Therefore, p + 2 is 5 + 2 = 7 mod 6, which is 1 mod 6. Therefore, p is 5 mod 6, p + 2 is 1 mod 6. Therefore, p + (p + 2) = 2p + 2 = 2(p + 1). Since p is 5 mod 6, p + 1 is 0 mod 6, so 2(p + 1) is 0 mod 12. Therefore, divisible by 12.

Therefore, this shows that the sum is divisible by 12. Therefore, the answer is proven.

But let me check with examples. Take p = 5. Then p + 2 = 7. Sum is 5 + 7 = 12, which is divisible by 12. Next, p = 11. Then p + 2 = 13. Sum is 24, which is divisible by 12. Next, p = 17. p + 2 = 19. Sum is 36, which is divisible by 12. p = 19. p + 2 = 21. Wait, 21 is not prime. Wait, but 19 and 21 are not twin primes. Wait, 19 is a prime, but 21 is not. So the next twin primes after 11 and 13 are 17 and 19. Then 17 + 19 = 36, which is 12*3. Then next twin primes: 29 and 31. Sum is 60, which is 12*5. So that works. Let me check p = 5, sum 12. Yes. So that seems to hold.

But why can't p be 1 mod 6? Let me take p = 7. Then p is 1 mod 6 (7 mod 6 is 1). Then p + 2 is 9, which is not prime. Therefore, 7 and 9 are not twin primes. Therefore, if p is 1 mod 6, then p + 2 is 3 mod 6, which is 3, but if p is 7, p + 2 is 9, which is 3*3. Therefore, not prime. Therefore, twin primes cannot have p ≡ 1 mod 6. Therefore, p must be 5 mod 6. Therefore, p + 1 is 0 mod 6, so 2(p + 1) is 0 mod 12. Therefore, the sum is divisible by 12.

Therefore, part (b) is proven.

But let me think again. Let me try to formalize this. Suppose p is a prime greater than 3. Then p is odd, so p is either 1 or 5 mod 6. If p ≡ 1 mod 6, then p + 2 ≡ 3 mod 6. Since p + 2 is 3 mod 6, then p + 2 is divisible by 3. Therefore, if p + 2 is greater than 3, it cannot be prime. Therefore, p cannot be 1 mod 6. Therefore, p must be 5 mod 6. Therefore, p + 1 is 0 mod 6. Therefore, p + 1 is divisible by 6, so 2(p + 1) is divisible by 12. Therefore, the sum p + (p + 2) = 2p + 2 = 2(p + 1) is divisible by 12. Therefore, this proves part (b).

Alternatively, we can think about the twin primes. Since p and p + 2 are both primes greater than 3, they must be congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. But since they are twin primes, they are two apart. If p ≡ 1 mod 6, then p + 2 ≡ 3 mod 6, which is not prime (as discussed). Therefore, p must be 5 mod 6, so p + 2 ≡ 1 mod 6. Therefore, p is 5 mod 6, and p + 2 is 1 mod 6. Therefore, their sum is 5 + 1 = 6 mod 6? Wait, no. Wait, the sum is p + (p + 2) = 2p + 2. If p ≡ 5 mod 6, then 2p + 2 ≡ 2*5 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12 ≡ 0 mod 6. Wait, but we need divisibility by 12. Wait, but 2p + 2 = 2(p + 1). Since p ≡ 5 mod 6, p + 1 ≡ 0 mod 6, so p + 1 is divisible by 6. Therefore, 2*(multiple of 6) is divisible by 12. Therefore, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the sum is divisible by 12.

Alternatively, maybe we can approach this using modular arithmetic. Let me try that. Since p is a prime greater than 3, it is odd, so p is odd. Therefore, p is either 1 or 5 mod 6. Let me check both cases.

Case 1: p ≡ 1 mod 6. Then p + 2 ≡ 3 mod 6. But 3 mod 6 is 3, which is not prime unless p + 2 = 3. But p is greater than 3, so p + 2 is at least 5 + 2 = 7, which is not 3. Therefore, this case is impossible. Therefore, p cannot be 1 mod 6.

Case 2: p ≡ 5 mod 6. Then p + 2 ≡ 5 + 2 = 7 ≡ 1 mod 6. Therefore, p + 2 is 1 mod 6, which is allowed. Therefore, p is 5 mod 6, p + 2 is 1 mod 6. Therefore, their sum is p + (p + 2) = 2p + 2. Since p ≡ 5 mod 6, then 2p + 2 ≡ 2*5 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12 ≡ 0 mod 12. Therefore, the sum is divisible by 12. Therefore, this proves part (b).

Alternatively, maybe we can think about divisibility by 3 and 4. Since 12 is 3*4. Let me check if the sum is divisible by 3 and 4.

First, divisibility by 3. Since p is a prime greater than 3, it is not divisible by 3. Therefore, p ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3. If p ≡ 1 mod 3, then p + 2 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, p + 2 is divisible by 3. Since p + 2 is a prime greater than 3, it must be 3 itself. But p + 2 = 3 implies p = 1, which is not prime. Therefore, p cannot be 1 mod 3. Therefore, p must be 2 mod 3. Therefore, p + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, the sum p + (p + 2) = 2p + 2 ≡ 2*2 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, the sum is divisible by 3.

Now, check divisibility by 4. Since p is an odd prime, p is odd. Therefore, p + 2 is also odd. Therefore, the sum p + (p + 2) = 2p + 2 = 2(p + 1). Since p is odd, p + 1 is even. Therefore, 2(p + 1) is divisible by 4. Therefore, the sum is divisible by 4. Therefore, since the sum is divisible by both 3 and 4, it is divisible by 12. Therefore, this is another way to see it.

Therefore, combining both divisibility by 3 and 4, the sum is divisible by 12.

Therefore, part (b) is proven.

So, to recap:

For part (a), the product of twin primes p and p + 2 is p(p + 2). Adding 1 gives p² + 2p + 1 = (p + 1)², which is a perfect square.

For part (b), the sum of twin primes p and p + 2 is 2p + 2 = 2(p + 1). Since p is a prime greater than 3, p is 5 mod 6, so p + 1 is divisible by 6, hence 2(p + 1) is divisible by 12.

Alternatively, by checking divisibility by 3 and 4, we can show that the sum is divisible by 12.

Therefore, both parts are proven.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{(p + 1)^2} is a perfect square.

(b) The sum is divisible by 12, so \boxed{12} is the divisor.

### (a) Proving that adding 1 to the product of twin primes results in a perfect square

Let $ p $ and $ p + 2 $ be twin primes. By definition, both $ p $ and $ p + 2 $ are prime numbers and differ by 2.

The product of the twin primes is:
$$
p(p + 2)
$$

Adding 1 to this product:
$$
p(p + 2) + 1 = p^2 + 2p + 1
$$

This expression is a perfect square:
$$
p^2 + 2p + 1 = (p + 1)^2
$$

Thus, the result is always a perfect square.

$$
\boxed{(p + 1)^2}
$$

### (b) Showing that the sum of twin primes $ p $ and $ p + 2 $ is divisible by 12, for $ p > 3 $

Let $ p $ and $ p + 2 $ be twin primes such that $ p > 3 $.

The sum of the twin primes is:
$$
p + (p + 2) = 2p + 2 = 2(p + 1)
$$

Now, consider the properties of primes greater than 3. All such primes are odd, and hence cannot be divisible by 2 or 3. Therefore, $ p \equiv 1 $ or $ 5 \mod 6 $.

- If $ p \equiv 1 \mod 6 $, then $ p + 2 \equiv 3 \mod 6 $, which is not prime unless $ p + 2 = 3 $, which would imply $ p = 1 $, not a prime.
- Therefore, $ p \equiv 5 \mod 6 $, which implies $ p + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 6 $.

Thus, $ p + 1 $ is divisible by 6, and so:
$$
2(p + 1)
$$
is divisible by $ 2 \times 6 = 12 $.

Hence, the sum of twin primes $ p $ and $ p + 2 $ is divisible by 12.

$$
\boxed{12}
$$
