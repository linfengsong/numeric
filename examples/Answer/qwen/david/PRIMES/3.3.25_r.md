Okay, so I need to show that for n > 3, the nth prime number, Pn, is less than the sum of the primes from p1 up to p_{n-1}. Wait, let me check the original problem again. It says "p_n < p_l + p_2 + ... + p_{n-l}". Hmm, maybe there's a typo in the problem statement? Because the way it's written, the indices don't make sense. Let me read it again: "For n > 3, show that p_n < p_l + p_2 + ... + p_{n-l}". Wait, maybe that's supposed to be p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_{n-1}? Because otherwise, the index l is undefined. Maybe it's a typo, and the problem is supposed to be p_n < p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_{n-1}? That would make more sense. Let me assume that's the case. Otherwise, the problem is not well-defined. So, I think the problem is to show that for n > 3, the nth prime is less than the sum of the first n-1 primes. Let me check with small n. Let's take n=4. The 4th prime is 7. The sum of the first 3 primes is 2 + 3 + 5 = 10. 7 < 10, which is true. For n=5, the 5th prime is 11. The sum of first 4 primes is 2+3+5+7=17. 11 < 17. For n=6, 13 vs 2+3+5+7+11=28. 13 < 28. So that seems to hold. But maybe the problem is different? Wait, the original problem says "p_l + p_2 + ... + p_{n-l}". Maybe that's supposed to be p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_{n-1}? Maybe the original problem had a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be p_{n-1} + ...? Wait, but the way it's written, the indices are l, 2, ..., n-l. That seems confusing. Maybe there's a different interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in Chinese or another language, and the translation has an error. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that p_n is less than the sum of primes from p_{n-1} down to p_1? But that would be the same as the sum of the first n-1 primes. So, maybe that's the intended problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that p_n is less than the sum of primes from p_{l} to p_{n-l} for some l? But without knowing what l is, it's unclear. Wait, maybe the original problem was supposed to be p_n < p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_{n-1}? That seems plausible. Let me check the original problem again: "For n > 3, show that p_n < p_l + p_2 + ... + p_{n-l}". Maybe there's a missing subscript? Like maybe p_{n - l} is supposed to be p_{n - 1}? Or maybe there's a typo in the indices. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that p_n is less than the sum of primes from p_{n - k} to p_{n - 1} for some k? But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given that for n=4, the sum of first n-1 primes is 10, which is greater than 7, and for n=5, 17 > 11, etc., maybe that's the intended problem. So, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the correct statement is p_n < p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_{n-1} for n > 3. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a specific source, and the indices are correct. Wait, maybe the problem is written as p_n < p_l + p_2 + ... + p_{n - l}, where l is some fixed number? But without knowing l, it's impossible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is supposed to be p_n < p_{n - 1} + p_{n - 2} + ... + p_2? But that would be the sum of primes from p_2 up to p_{n-1}. But for n=4, that would be 3 + 5 = 8, which is greater than 7. For n=5, 5 + 7 + 11? Wait, no. Wait, if it's p_{n - 1} + ... + p_2, then for n=4, it's p_3 + p_2 = 5 + 3 = 8, which is greater than 7. For n=5, p_4 + p_3 + p_2 = 7 + 5 + 3 = 15, which is greater than 11. For n=6, p_5 + p_4 + p_3 + p_2 = 11 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 26, which is greater than 13. So that also seems to hold. However, the problem statement is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that p_n is less than the sum of primes from p_{n - k} to p_{n - 1} for some k? But again, without knowing k, it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written with a different notation. Wait, maybe the original problem was in Chinese, and the translation is off. Alternatively, maybe the problem is supposed to be p_n < p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_{n - 1}? Let me check some references. Wait, I can't actually check references, but maybe I can think of known results. There is a known result that the sum of the first n primes is greater than the nth prime for sufficiently large n. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that p_n is less than the sum of the previous primes. Let me try to think about how to approach this. If I can show that the sum of the first n-1 primes is greater than p_n for n > 3. Let's try to find a general proof. First, let's recall that primes are infinite and grow roughly like n log n (by the prime number theorem). However, the sum of the first n primes is roughly (1/2) n^2 log n. So, comparing the sum of the first n-1 primes to the nth prime. Since the sum grows faster than the nth prime, this inequality should hold for sufficiently large n. However, the problem says n > 3, so maybe it's true for all n > 3. Let me check for n=4, 5, 6, etc. For n=4: sum of first 3 primes is 2+3+5=10 > 7. For n=5: 2+3+5+7=17 > 11. For n=6: 2+3+5+7+11=28 > 13. For n=7: 2+3+5+7+11+13=41 > 17. For n=8: sum is 41 + 17 = 58 > 19. For n=9: 58 + 23 = 81 > 23? Wait, no, p_9 is 23? Wait, p_1=2, p_2=3, p_3=5, p_4=7, p_5=11, p_6=13, p_7=17, p_8=19, p_9=23. So sum up to p_8 is 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19= 77. 77 > 23. So yes. So seems like it's true. But how to prove it in general? Maybe using induction? Let's try. For n=4, it's true. Assume that for some n ≥ 4, the sum of the first n-1 primes is greater than p_n. Then, need to show that the sum of the first n primes is greater than p_{n+1}. Wait, but the induction step would need to relate the sum up to n primes to p_{n+1}. However, the problem is about p_n < sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k. So maybe induction on n. Let me try. Base case n=4: sum of first 3 primes is 10 > 7. Assume that for some n ≥ 4, sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k > p_n. Need to show that sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k > p_{n+1}. Well, sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k + p_n > p_n + p_n = 2p_n. So need to show that 2p_n > p_{n+1}. Is this true? Well, if we can show that p_{n+1} < 2p_n, then this would hold. However, is p_{n+1} < 2p_n for all n ≥ 4? Let's check. For n=4: p_5=11, 2p_4=14. 11 < 14. For n=5: p_6=13, 2p_5=22. 13 < 22. For n=6: p_7=17, 2p_6=26. 17 < 26. For n=7: p_8=19, 2p_7=34. 19 < 34. So seems true. But is this always true? Well, primes are not too dense. The next prime after p_n is at most 2p_n? Wait, actually, there is a result called Bertrand's postulate which states that for any integer n > 1, there is always a prime p such that n < p < 2n. However, Bertrand's postulate is about primes between n and 2n. But here, we are talking about p_{n+1} < 2p_n. Wait, but if we have that between p_n and 2p_n there is at least one prime, but p_{n+1} is the next prime after p_n. However, if p_{n+1} is the next prime after p_n, then it's possible that p_{n+1} is less than 2p_n. However, is this always true? For example, take p_n = 2, then p_{n+1} = 3 < 4. For p_n=3, p_{n+1}=5 < 6. For p_n=5, p_{n+1}=7 < 10. For p_n=7, p_{n+1}=11 < 14. For p_n=11, p_{n+1}=13 < 22. So yes, seems like p_{n+1} < 2p_n. However, is this always true? Wait, actually, Bertrand's postulate says that there is a prime between n and 2n. But here, if p_n is the nth prime, then p_{n+1} is the next prime after p_n. However, the question is whether p_{n+1} < 2p_n. But according to Bertrand's postulate, if we take n = p_n, then there is a prime between p_n and 2p_n. Therefore, p_{n+1} is less than 2p_n. Wait, but p_{n+1} is the next prime after p_n, so if there is a prime between p_n and 2p_n, then p_{n+1} is less than 2p_n. Therefore, p_{n+1} < 2p_n. Hence, if we can show that p_{n+1} < 2p_n, then the induction step would hold. Therefore, if we can show that p_{n+1} < 2p_n for all n ≥ 4, then the induction step holds. But is this true? Wait, let's check for larger primes. For example, take p_n = 17 (the 7th prime). Then 2p_n = 34. The next prime after 17 is 19 < 34. For p_n = 19 (the 8th prime), next prime is 23 < 38. For p_n = 23 (the 9th prime), next prime is 29 < 46. For p_n = 29 (the 10th prime), next prime is 31 < 58. So yes, seems like p_{n+1} < 2p_n. However, is there a case where p_{n+1} ≥ 2p_n? For example, if p_n is very large, but according to Bertrand's postulate, there is always a prime between p_n and 2p_n. Therefore, p_{n+1} must be less than 2p_n. Wait, but Bertrand's postulate is for any integer n > 1, there is a prime between n and 2n. However, in our case, p_n is the nth prime. So, for example, if we take n=1, then between 1 and 2 there is 2. For n=2, between 2 and 4 there is 3. For n=3, between 3 and 6 there is 5. For n=4, between 4 and 8 there is 5,7. So, in general, for any n, there is a prime between n and 2n. However, p_n is the nth prime. So, if we take n as the integer, then p_n is the nth prime, which is approximately n log n. But Bertrand's postulate says that for any integer n > 1, there is a prime between n and 2n. Therefore, if we consider the prime p_n, then the next prime p_{n+1} is less than 2p_n? Wait, not necessarily. Because p_n is the nth prime, which is larger than n. So, if we take the interval between p_n and 2p_n, there is at least one prime. However, p_{n+1} is the next prime after p_n, so it must be less than 2p_n. Therefore, p_{n+1} < 2p_n. Therefore, the induction step holds. Therefore, if we can show that p_{n+1} < 2p_n, then the induction step holds. Therefore, the induction hypothesis is that sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k > p_n. Then, sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k + p_n > p_n + p_n = 2p_n > p_{n+1}. Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k > p_{n+1}. Therefore, by induction, for all n ≥ 4, sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k > p_n. Therefore, the statement is proven. Wait, but the induction starts at n=4. Let me check the base case again. For n=4: sum_{k=1}^{3} p_k = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 > 7 = p_4. Then, assuming that for n, sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k > p_n. Then, for n+1, sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k > p_{n+1}. Therefore, the induction holds. Therefore, the conclusion is that for all n ≥ 4, p_n < sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k. Therefore, the original problem must have been to show that p_n < sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k for n > 3. Therefore, the answer is that by induction and using Bertrand's postulate, we can show that the sum of the first n-1 primes is greater than the nth prime for n > 3. However, I need to make sure that Bertrand's postulate is applicable here. Wait, Bertrand's postulate says that for any integer n > 1, there is a prime between n and 2n. But in our case, we have that p_{n+1} < 2p_n. Let me think. Since p_n is the nth prime, and according to Bertrand's postulate, there is a prime between p_n and 2p_n. Therefore, since p_{n+1} is the next prime after p_n, it must be less than 2p_n. Therefore, p_{n+1} < 2p_n. Therefore, the induction step is valid. Therefore, the conclusion is correct. Therefore, the original problem must have a typo, and the correct statement is p_n < sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k for n > 3. Therefore, the answer is that this inequality holds by induction, using the fact that p_{n+1} < 2p_n, which follows from Bertrand's postulate. Therefore, the problem is solved. However, let me check for n=4, the induction step. For n=4, we have sum_{k=1}^{3} p_k = 10 > 7. Then, for n=5, sum_{k=1}^{4} p_k = 17 > 11. Then, for n=5, we need to show that sum_{k=1}^{4} p_k > p_5. Which is 17 > 11. Then, for the induction step, assuming that sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k > p_n, then sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} p_k + p_n > p_n + p_n = 2p_n > p_{n+1}. Therefore, the induction holds. Therefore, the conclusion is correct. Therefore, the answer is that for n > 3, p_n is less than the sum of the first n-1 primes. Therefore, the problem statement likely had a typo, and the correct inequality is as such. Therefore, the final answer is that the inequality holds, and the proof is by induction using Bertrand's postulate. However, since the original problem mentions p_l + p_2 + ... + p_{n-l}, which is unclear, but assuming that it was a typo and the intended statement is the sum of the first n-1 primes, then the proof is as above. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{p_n < p_1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_{n-1}} for n > 3. But the problem says to show that p_n < p_l + p_2 + ... + p_{n-l}, which is unclear. However, given the context, I think the intended problem is as I have solved, so I will proceed with that.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{p_n < p_1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_{n-1}}
</think>

To prove that for all $ n > 3 $, the $ n $-th prime number $ p_n $ is less than the sum of the first $ n-1 $ primes, we proceed with a proof by **mathematical induction**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Inequality**

We are to show:

$$
p_n < p_1 + p_2 + \cdots + p_{n-1}
$$

This is a well-known result in number theory, and it holds for all $ n > 3 $, based on the growth rate of the prime numbers and their cumulative sums.

---

### **Step 2: Base Case**

For $ n = 4 $:

- $ p_4 = 7 $
- $ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 $
- Clearly, $ 7 < 10 $

So, the base case holds.

---

### **Step 3: Inductive Hypothesis**

Assume the inequality holds for some $ n \geq 4 $, i.e.,

$$
p_n < p_1 + p_2 + \cdots + p_{n-1}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Inductive Step**

We need to show that:

$$
p_{n+1} < p_1 + p_2 + \cdots + p_n
$$

From the inductive hypothesis, we know:

$$
p_1 + p_2 + \cdots + p_{n-1} > p_n
$$

Adding $ p_n $ to both sides:

$$
p_1 + p_2 + \cdots + p_n > p_n + p_n = 2p_n
$$

Now, we must show that:

$$
2p_n > p_{n+1}
$$

This is where **Bertrand's Postulate** becomes crucial. It states that for any integer $ n > 1 $, there is at least one prime between $ n $ and $ 2n $.

In our case, since $ p_n $ is the $ n $-th prime, the next prime $ p_{n+1} $ is the smallest prime greater than $ p_n $. By Bertrand's Postulate, there is a prime between $ p_n $ and $ 2p_n $, so:

$$
p_{n+1} < 2p_n
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
p_1 + p_2 + \cdots + p_n > 2p_n > p_{n+1}
$$

Therefore, the inequality holds for $ n+1 $, completing the inductive step.

---

### **Conclusion**

By induction, the inequality

$$
p_n < p_1 + p_2 + \cdots + p_{n-1}
$$

holds for all $ n > 3 $.

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{p_n < p_1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_{n-1}}
$$
