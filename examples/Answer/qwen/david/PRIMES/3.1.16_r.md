Okay, so I need to prove two things about square-free integers. Let me start with part (a). The problem says that an integer n > 1 is square-free if and only if it can be factored into a product of distinct primes. Hmm. Let me recall what square-free means. A square-free integer isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1. So, that means if you take any prime number p, p² shouldn't divide n. So, for example, 12 is not square-free because it's divisible by 4 (which is 2²), but 6 is square-free because its prime factors are 2 and 3, and neither squared divides it.

So, the first part is an if and only if statement. That means I need to prove both directions: if n is square-free, then it factors into distinct primes, and vice versa, if it factors into distinct primes, then it's square-free.

Let me start with the first direction: if n is square-free, then it can be factored into distinct primes. Well, if n is square-free, then in its prime factorization, no prime appears more than once. Because if there was a prime p with exponent at least 2, then p² would divide n, which would contradict the square-free condition. Therefore, the prime factorization would have exponents all equal to 1, so it's just a product of distinct primes. So that seems straightforward.

Now the other direction: if n can be factored into a product of distinct primes, then it's square-free. Suppose n is a product of distinct primes, say n = p₁p₂...p_k, where each p_i is prime and all different. Then, in the prime factorization of n, each prime appears exactly once. Therefore, there's no prime squared dividing n, so n is square-free. That seems to check out.

Wait, but maybe I need to be more careful here. Let me think. If n is a product of distinct primes, then when you factor it into primes, each prime is only present once. Therefore, there's no square factor. So, for example, if n is 2*3*5, then n is 30, and 30 isn't divisible by 4, 9, 25, etc. So that works. So that seems okay. So part (a) is done?

But maybe I need to formalize it more. Let me try again.

First direction: Suppose n is square-free. Then, by definition, for any prime p, p² does not divide n. Therefore, in the prime factorization of n, each prime can only appear once. Because if a prime p appeared twice, then p² would divide n. Therefore, the prime factorization of n is a product of distinct primes. Therefore, n can be factored into distinct primes.

Second direction: Suppose n can be factored into a product of distinct primes. Then, in the prime factorization of n, each prime appears exactly once. Therefore, there is no prime p such that p² divides n. Hence, n is square-free.

So that seems to work. Therefore, part (a) is proven.

Now moving on to part (b): Every integer n > 1 is the product of a square-free integer and a perfect square. Hmm. So, for any n > 1, there exist square-free integer s and perfect square k² such that n = s * k². How do I approach this?

I think the way to do this is to take the prime factorization of n. Let me recall that any integer can be written as a product of primes, possibly with exponents. So, suppose n = p₁^a₁ * p₂^a₂ * ... * p_k^a_k. Then, for each prime, we can write the exponent as a sum of a multiple of 2 and a remainder. For example, if a_i is even, then we can write it as 2*b_i, so that p_i^{2*b_i} is a square. If a_i is odd, then we can write it as 2*b_i + 1, so that p_i^{2*b_i + 1} = p_i^{2*b_i} * p_i. Therefore, if we take the square part as the product of p_i^{2*b_i} for all primes, and the square-free part as the product of p_i for primes where the exponent was odd. Then, the square-free part would be the product of primes with odd exponents, and the square part would be the product of primes raised to even exponents.

But wait, in that case, the square-free part would be square-free, since each prime is only present once. And the square part is a perfect square. Therefore, n = square-free * square. So that seems to work.

Let me try to formalize this. Let me take the prime factorization of n: n = ∏_{p|n} p^{a_p}, where a_p is the exponent of prime p in n. For each prime p, write a_p as 2*b_p + c_p, where c_p is 0 or 1. Wait, actually, more precisely, for each exponent a_p, we can write it as a_p = 2*b_p + r_p, where r_p is 0 or 1. Wait, no, if a_p is even, then r_p is 0, and if a_p is odd, then r_p is 1. Then, we can write:

n = ∏_{p|n} p^{2*b_p + r_p} = ∏_{p|n} (p^{2*b_p} * p^{r_p}) = [∏_{p|n} p^{2*b_p}] * [∏_{p|n} p^{r_p}].

Now, the first product is a square, since each exponent is even. The second product is square-free, because each prime is raised to the first power (since r_p is 0 or 1). However, note that if r_p is 0, then that prime is not included in the second product. Therefore, the second product is the product of primes p where r_p is 1, i.e., primes with odd exponents in the original factorization. Therefore, n is the product of a square and a square-free integer.

Therefore, this shows that any integer n > 1 can be written as the product of a square-free integer and a perfect square. Hence, part (b) is proven.

But let me check with an example. Let's take n = 12. Its prime factorization is 2² * 3¹. Then, the square part is 2², and the square-free part is 3. Therefore, 12 = 3 * 2². Which is correct.

Another example: n = 18 = 2¹ * 3². Then, square part is 3², square-free part is 2. 2 * 9 = 18. Correct.

Another example: n = 100 = 2² * 5². Then square-free part is 1, and square part is 100. But 1 is square-free. So 100 = 1 * 10². That works.

Another example: n = 7. It's prime, so square-free part is 7, square part is 1. 7 = 7 * 1². Correct.

Another example: n = 12. As before. So seems to work.

But wait, in the case where n is square-free, then the square part is 1, and the square-free part is n. So that's okay.

But let me check if the square-free part is indeed square-free. In the above decomposition, the square-free part is the product of primes with odd exponents. Since each of those primes is only included once, the square-free part is square-free. So that's correct.

Therefore, part (b) is proven.

But let me think again if there's a possible mistake here. Suppose n is 1. But the problem says n > 1, so that's okay. For n = 2, square-free part is 2, square part is 1. For n = 4, square-free part is 1, square part is 4. So that works.

Wait, but is there a case where the square-free part might not be square-free? Suppose we have n = p^3. Then, the exponents are 3. So, 3 = 2*1 + 1. So square part is p^{2*1} = p², square-free part is p. Which is square-free. So that's okay.

Another example: n = p^5. Then, exponents 5 = 2*2 + 1. Square part is p^{4}, square-free part is p. So  p^5 = p * p^4. Correct.

Therefore, this seems to work. Therefore, the decomposition is valid.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that any integer can be written as s * k² where s is square-free. Because if you take the square-free part as the product of primes with odd exponents, and then the square part as the product of primes with even exponents. Therefore, this is a standard result in number theory. So I think this is correct.

Therefore, both parts (a) and (b) are proven.

Wait, but for part (a), is there a case where a number can be factored into distinct primes but is not square-free? No, because if it's factored into distinct primes, then there are no repeated primes, so no square factors. Therefore, square-free. Conversely, if it's square-free, then in the prime factorization, there are no repeated primes, so it's a product of distinct primes.

Therefore, the proof is correct.

So, I think that's all. The key idea for part (a) is that square-free numbers have prime factors with exponents 1, and part (b) is decomposing the number into square and square-free parts by separating the exponents into even and odd.

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{\text{Proven}}  
(b) \boxed{\text{Proven}}

To solve the problem, we need to analyze and prove two key properties of square-free integers:

---

### **(a) An integer $ n > 1 $ is square-free if and only if $ n $ can be factored into a product of distinct primes.**

#### **Understanding the Definition of Square-Free:**

An integer is **square-free** if it is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1. That is, for any prime $ p > 1 $, $ p^2 \nmid n $.

#### **Proof of the "If and Only If" Statement:**

**1. If $ n $ is square-free, then $ n $ can be factored into distinct primes.**

- Suppose $ n $ is square-free. Then, in its prime factorization, no prime appears more than once. That is, for every prime $ p $ dividing $ n $, the exponent of $ p $ in the factorization is exactly 1.
- Therefore, $ n $ is the product of distinct primes.

**2. If $ n $ can be factored into distinct primes, then $ n $ is square-free.**

- Suppose $ n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k $, where $ p_i $ are distinct primes.
- Then, the prime factorization of $ n $ has no repeated primes, so no prime squared divides $ n $.
- Therefore, $ n $ is square-free.

Thus, the two directions of the "if and only if" are both established.

---

### **(b) Every integer $ n > 1 $ is the product of a square-free integer and a perfect square.**

#### **Understanding the Decomposition:**

We are to show that for any integer $ n > 1 $, there exist integers $ s $ and $ k $ such that:
$$
n = s \cdot k^2
$$
where:
- $ s $ is **square-free** (i.e., no prime divides $ s $ more than once),
- $ k^2 $ is a **perfect square**.

#### **Proof:**

Let $ n $ have the prime factorization:
$$
n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}
$$
For each exponent $ a_i $, we can write:
$$
a_i = 2b_i + r_i
$$
where $ r_i \in \{0, 1\} $.

Then, we can write:
$$
n = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{2b_i + r_i} = \left( \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{2b_i} \right) \cdot \left( \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{r_i} \right)
$$

- The first product $ \prod p_i^{2b_i} $ is a perfect square (since all exponents are even).
- The second product $ \prod p_i^{r_i} $ is square-free because each prime appears at most once (since $ r_i = 0 $ or $ 1 $).

Thus, we have:
$$
n = s \cdot k^2
$$
where $ s $ is square-free and $ k^2 $ is a perfect square.

This completes the proof.

---

### **Conclusion:**

- **(a)** An integer $ n > 1 $ is square-free if and only if it is a product of distinct primes.
- **(b)** Every integer $ n > 1 $ can be uniquely expressed as the product of a square-free integer and a perfect square.
