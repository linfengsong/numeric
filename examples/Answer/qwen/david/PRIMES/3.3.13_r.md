Okay, so I need to show that there are infinitely many primes of the form 6n + 5 using the same method as in Theorem 3.6. Hmm, I remember that Theorem 3.6 is probably about primes of the form 6n + 1 or 6n - 1, right? Maybe it's using a similar approach to Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes. Let me recall how Euclid's proof works. He assumes there are only finitely many primes, multiplies them all together, adds 1, and shows that the result is not divisible by any of the primes, leading to a contradiction. 

So maybe the idea here is similar. Let me try to think. If I want to show there are infinitely many primes congruent to 5 mod 6, I need to assume there are only finitely many, say p₁, p₂, ..., pₖ, all primes of the form 6n + 5. Then, maybe I can construct a number that's not divisible by any of them, leading to a contradiction. But how exactly?

Wait, primes of the form 6n + 5 are congruent to -1 mod 6. So maybe I need to consider numbers that are products of these primes and then add something? Let me try to think of a similar construction.

In the standard proof for primes congruent to 1 mod 4 or something, you take the product of all such primes and add 1. But maybe here, since we are dealing with 6n + 5, I need to adjust accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the same approach as in the proof for primes of the form 6n + 1. Let me check. Suppose we have primes p₁, p₂, ..., pₖ which are all primes congruent to 5 mod 6. Let me consider the number N = (p₁p₂...pₖ) - 1. Wait, but if I take N = (product of primes) - 1, then N is congruent to -1 mod 6, since each prime is congruent to 5 mod 6, so their product is congruent to 5^k mod 6. Then subtracting 1 would make it 5^k - 1 mod 6. But 5 is congruent to -1 mod 6, so 5^k is (-1)^k mod 6. Therefore, N is (-1)^k - 1 mod 6. If k is even, that would be 1 - 1 = 0 mod 6. If k is odd, it would be -1 -1 = -2 mod 6, which is 4 mod 6. So depending on k, N is either 0 or 4 mod 6. Hmm, but that might not be helpful. Maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider N = (product of primes) + 1? Let me check. If N is product of primes + 1, then mod 6, it would be 5^k + 1 mod 6. Again, 5 is -1, so (-1)^k + 1. If k is even, that is 1 + 1 = 2 mod 6. If k is odd, that is -1 + 1 = 0 mod 6. So again, depending on k, N is either 0 or 2 mod 6. If k is odd, then N is 0 mod 6, so divisible by 6. But 6 is not prime, so maybe that's not helpful. But if N is divisible by 6, then it's composite, but maybe that's not useful. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to take a different approach. Let me think. In the standard proof for primes congruent to 1 mod something, sometimes you take the product and then add 1, but maybe here, since we have primes congruent to 5 mod 6, which is equivalent to -1 mod 6, maybe I need to consider something else. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that primes are either 1 or 5 mod 6. So if I assume there are only finitely many primes congruent to 5 mod 6, then consider the product of all such primes, and then consider some number that is not divisible by any of them. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the same method as in the proof for primes congruent to 1 mod 6. Wait, but I need to think of a way to construct a number that is not divisible by any of the primes in the list, and then show that it must have a prime factor not in the list. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of the primality of numbers in arithmetic progressions. But I need to stick to the method used in Theorem 3.6, which I don't have the exact details of. But since the user says "apply the same method of proof as in Theorem 3.6", maybe it's similar to Euclid's proof. 

Wait, maybe I should think of primes congruent to 5 mod 6 as primes not dividing 6. So, if I take the product of all primes congruent to 5 mod 6, say P = p₁p₂...pₖ, then consider N = P - 1. Then N is congruent to -1 mod 6, which is 5 mod 6. So N is congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, N could be prime or composite. If N is prime, then it's a prime congruent to 5 mod 6, which is not in the original list, so we have a contradiction. If N is composite, then it must have a prime factor. But since N is congruent to 5 mod 6, any prime factor of N must be congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. However, if all prime factors are in the original list, then they are congruent to 5 mod 6. But if N is divisible by such a prime, then that prime divides N = P - 1, so it divides P. But P is the product of all primes in the list, so that prime divides P, which is impossible because N = P - 1. Therefore, N cannot have any prime factors in the original list, so it must have a prime factor not in the list. Therefore, there is a prime congruent to 5 mod 6 not in the original list, hence there are infinitely many.

Wait, but this seems similar to the standard proof for primes congruent to 1 mod something. But let me check the details again. Suppose we have primes p₁, p₂, ..., pₖ all congruent to 5 mod 6. Let P be their product. Then N = P - 1. Then N is congruent to -1 mod 6, which is 5 mod 6. Therefore, N is congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, if N is prime, then it's a prime of the form 6n + 5, which is not in the original list. If N is composite, then it must have a prime factor. But since N is congruent to 5 mod 6, any prime factor q of N must be congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. If q is congruent to 1 mod 6, then q is not in the original list. If q is congruent to 5 mod 6, then q divides P, which is the product of all primes in the original list. But since N = P - 1, then q divides N and q divides P, so q divides N - P = -1, which is impossible. Therefore, q cannot divide P, so q cannot be in the original list. Therefore, N must have a prime factor not in the original list. Therefore, there is a prime congruent to 5 mod 6 not in the original list, hence there are infinitely many primes of that form.

Wait, that seems to work. But let me check if there's a problem with this approach. For example, if N is 1, but N is P - 1. If P is the product of primes, then P is at least 5 (if k=1, P=5, N=4). But 4 is not prime, but 4 is 2^2. However, 2 is not congruent to 5 mod 6. So in this case, the prime factors of N would be 2 and maybe others. But since N is congruent to 5 mod 6, which is 5 mod 6, so 5 mod 6 is 5, 11, 17, etc. But if N is 4, which is 2^2, then the prime factors are 2, which is not congruent to 5 mod 6. But then, how does that fit into the argument?

Wait, so if N is 4, then it's not congruent to 5 mod 6. Wait, but earlier I said that N = P - 1 is congruent to 5 mod 6. Wait, no. Wait, if P is the product of primes congruent to 5 mod 6, then P is congruent to 5^k mod 6. Since each prime is 5 mod 6, their product is 5^k mod 6. Then N = P - 1 is 5^k - 1 mod 6. So if k is 1, N is 5 - 1 = 4 mod 6. If k is 2, N is 25 - 1 = 24 mod 6, which is 0. If k is 3, 125 - 1 = 124 mod 6, which is 124 / 6 is 20*6=120, 124-120=4, so 4 mod 6. So depending on k, N is either 0 or 4 mod 6. 

So in the case when k is even, N is 0 mod 6, which is divisible by 6. Therefore, N is divisible by 2 and 3. But 2 and 3 are not congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, in this case, the prime factors of N would include 2 and 3, which are not in the original list. Therefore, even if N is composite, it has prime factors not in the original list. Therefore, regardless of k, N has a prime factor not in the original list. Therefore, the argument holds. 

But in the case when k is even, N is divisible by 6, which is 2*3. Therefore, N has prime factors 2 and 3, which are not in the original list. Therefore, even if N is composite, we have that there is a prime factor not in the original list. Therefore, regardless of whether N is prime or composite, there is a prime not in the original list. Therefore, the proof holds.

But wait, in the case when k is odd, N is 4 mod 6. Therefore, N is congruent to 4 mod 6, so it is even, but not divisible by 3. Therefore, N is even, so 2 divides N. Therefore, 2 is a prime factor of N. But 2 is not congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, again, there is a prime factor not in the original list. Therefore, regardless of k, N has a prime factor not in the original list. Therefore, the proof works.

Therefore, the argument is that if you assume there are finitely many primes of the form 6n + 5, then taking their product and subtracting 1 gives a number N that is either divisible by 2 or 3 or has a prime factor congruent to 5 mod 6 not in the original list. But in any case, since N is not divisible by any of the primes in the original list, then there must be another prime factor not in the original list, which is congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes of that form.

But wait, but in the case where N is 4, which is 2^2, then the prime factor is 2, which is not congruent to 5 mod 6. However, in that case, the argument is that there is a prime factor not in the original list, which is 2. But 2 is not congruent to 5 mod 6. However, the original assumption was that the list contains primes congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, 2 is not in the list, so that's okay. Therefore, even though 2 is not congruent to 5 mod 6, the existence of a prime factor not in the list is sufficient. However, the problem is to show that there are infinitely many primes of the form 6n + 5. Therefore, even if N has a prime factor that is not in the list, but that prime is not of the form 6n + 5, then how does that help?

Wait, no. Wait, the key is that N is congruent to 5 mod 6 when k is odd, or 0 mod 6 when k is even. However, in the case when N is 0 mod 6, then N is divisible by 2 and 3. But if N is 0 mod 6, then N is divisible by 2 and 3. However, 2 and 3 are not congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, the prime factors of N would be 2, 3, and maybe others. However, if N is divisible by 2, then 2 is a prime factor not in the original list. Similarly for 3. However, the original list is primes of the form 6n + 5, which are 5, 11, 17, etc. So 2 and 3 are not in the list. Therefore, the existence of 2 or 3 as a prime factor is not helpful for the conclusion that there is a prime of the form 6n + 5 not in the list. Therefore, perhaps my previous reasoning is flawed.

Wait, this is a problem. Because if N is divisible by 2 or 3, then that doesn't necessarily give us a prime factor of the form 6n + 5. Therefore, maybe my initial approach is wrong. 

So, perhaps I need to adjust the construction. Let me think again. Maybe instead of N = P - 1, I need to construct a number that is congruent to 5 mod 6 and not divisible by any of the primes in the list. Then, if that number is composite, it must have a prime factor not in the list, which would be congruent to 5 mod 6.

So how can I construct such a number?

Alternatively, maybe I can take the product of all primes congruent to 5 mod 6, and then add 1? Let me check. Let me take P = product of primes p₁, p₂,...,pₖ ≡5 mod 6. Then N = P + 1. Then N ≡ 5^k + 1 mod 6. Since 5 ≡ -1 mod 6, so N ≡ (-1)^k + 1 mod 6. If k is even, then N ≡ 1 + 1 = 2 mod 6. If k is odd, then N ≡ -1 + 1 = 0 mod 6. So again, similar issues.

If k is even, N ≡ 2 mod 6, which is not divisible by 2 or 3. Therefore, N is congruent to 2 mod 6. Therefore, if N is prime, it's 2 mod 6, which is 2 or something else. But 2 is not congruent to 5 mod 6. If N is composite, then its prime factors are either 2, 3, or primes congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. But since N ≡ 2 mod 6, then it's not divisible by 3. If N is divisible by 2, then it's 2 times something. But if N is not divisible by 2, then it must have prime factors congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. However, if N is congruent to 2 mod 6, then it's 2 mod 6, so if it's composite, then it must have a prime factor congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. However, if all prime factors are congruent to 5 mod 6, then their product would be 5^m mod 6. But N is 2 mod 6. However, 5^m mod 6 is either 1 or 5. Therefore, 5^m ≡ 2 mod 6 is impossible. Therefore, N cannot be divisible by primes congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, if N is composite, then it must have a prime factor congruent to 1 mod 6. Therefore, that prime is not in the original list (since the original list is primes congruent to 5 mod 6). Therefore, that's a prime not in the list, but it's congruent to 1 mod 6. Therefore, that doesn't help us with primes congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, this approach may not work.

Alternatively, if k is odd, then N = P + 1 ≡ 0 mod 6, so N is divisible by 6, so 2 and 3. Again, similar problem as before.

Hmm, so maybe the problem is that N = P ± 1 is not congruent to 5 mod 6 unless k is odd. But when k is odd, N is 0 mod 6. So maybe I need to find a different N.

Alternatively, maybe instead of taking the product of primes congruent to 5 mod 6, I can take the product of primes congruent to 1 mod 6 and primes congruent to 5 mod 6, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use a different construction. Let me think. Let me consider the primes congruent to 5 mod 6. Suppose there are only finitely many, say p₁, p₂,...,pₖ. Let me consider the number N = (p₁p₂...pₖ) + 5. Then N is congruent to 5 mod 6, since each p_i is 5 mod 6, so their product is 5^k mod 6, and adding 5 gives 5^k + 5 mod 6. Let me compute that. Since 5 ≡ -1 mod 6, so 5^k + 5 ≡ (-1)^k + (-1) mod 6. If k is even, then (-1)^k = 1, so 1 -1 = 0 mod 6. If k is odd, then (-1)^k = -1, so -1 -1 = -2 ≡ 4 mod 6. So again, depending on k, N is 0 or 4 mod 6. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe take N = (p₁p₂...pₖ) - 5. Then N ≡ 5^k - 5 mod 6. Which is (-1)^k - (-1) mod 6. If k is even, (-1)^k - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2 mod 6. If k is odd, -1 + 1 = 0 mod 6. Again, same issues.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider a different approach. Maybe consider the fact that primes congruent to 5 mod 6 are the same as primes congruent to -1 mod 6. So maybe I can use the concept of the Dirichlet's theorem, but since the user wants the same method as Theorem 3.6, which I don't have, but assuming it's similar to Euclid's proof.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if there are only finitely many primes of the form 6n + 5, then consider the product of all such primes, say P, and then consider P + 1. Wait, but earlier that didn't work. However, maybe if I take P + 1, and then consider its prime factors. But if P is the product of primes congruent to 5 mod 6, then P + 1 is congruent to 5^k + 1 mod 6. Which as before, if k is even, it's 2 mod 6, and if k is odd, 0 mod 6. 

But if k is even, then P + 1 is 2 mod 6. Therefore, it's not divisible by 2 or 3. Therefore, any prime factor of P + 1 must be congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. If all prime factors are congruent to 5 mod 6, then their product would be 5^m mod 6, but P + 1 is 2 mod 6, which is not possible. Therefore, there must be at least one prime factor congruent to 1 mod 6. Therefore, that prime is not in the original list (since the original list is primes congruent to 5 mod 6). Therefore, that's a prime not in the list, but it's congruent to 1 mod 6. Therefore, this doesn't help us with primes congruent to 5 mod 6. However, if P + 1 is prime, then it's congruent to 2 mod 6, which is 2. But 2 is not congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, that doesn't help either.

Alternatively, if k is odd, then P + 1 is 0 mod 6, so divisible by 2 and 3. Therefore, again, prime factors are 2, 3, or others. But again, not helpful.

Hmm, so maybe this approach is not working. Let me think again. Maybe I need to construct a number that is congruent to 5 mod 6 and not divisible by any of the primes in the list. How can I do that?

Let me think. Suppose I take the product of all primes congruent to 5 mod 6, say P. Then consider N = P + 1. If N is congruent to 5 mod 6, then it's not divisible by any of the primes in the list. But earlier calculations showed that N is congruent to 2 mod 6 if k is even, and 0 mod 6 if k is odd. Therefore, not helpful. Alternatively, maybe take N = P - 1. If k is odd, then N is 4 mod 6. If k is even, N is 0 mod 6. So again, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe take N = (product of primes congruent to 5 mod 6) * something + something. Maybe I need to use a different construction. Let me think about the original proof for primes congruent to 1 mod 4. In that case, you take the product of all primes congruent to 1 mod 4, add 1, and show that the result is not divisible by any of them, hence has a prime factor congruent to 1 mod 4. 

So maybe here, if I take the product of primes congruent to 5 mod 6, then multiply by something and add something to get a number that is congruent to 5 mod 6 and not divisible by any of them. 

Wait, but if I take the product of primes congruent to 5 mod 6, say P, then P is congruent to 5^k mod 6. If I take P + 1, then as before, it's 5^k + 1 mod 6. If I take P + 5, then it's 5^k + 5 mod 6. Which is 5(5^{k-1} + 1) mod 6. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I need to take a number that is congruent to 5 mod 6 and not divisible by any of the primes in the list. How can I construct that?

For example, if I take the product of all primes congruent to 5 mod 6, then multiply by 2 and add 1. Let me see. Let me define N = 2 * P + 1. Then N is congruent to 2 * 5^k + 1 mod 6. Since 5 ≡ -1 mod 6, this is 2*(-1)^k + 1 mod 6. If k is even, then N ≡ 2*1 + 1 = 3 mod 6. If k is odd, N ≡ 2*(-1) + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1 ≡ 5 mod 6. Therefore, if k is odd, N ≡ 5 mod 6. If k is even, N ≡ 3 mod 6. 

So if k is odd, then N is congruent to 5 mod 6, and if it's not divisible by any of the primes in the list, then it must have a prime factor congruent to 5 mod 6. But since N = 2P + 1, and P is the product of primes congruent to 5 mod 6, then any prime factor q of N must satisfy q divides 2P + 1. Therefore, q divides 2P + 1 and q divides P. Therefore, q divides (2P + 1) - 2P = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, q cannot divide P, so q is not in the original list. Therefore, N has a prime factor not in the list. Therefore, since N ≡ 5 mod 6, that prime factor must be congruent to 5 mod 6. Hence, there is a prime congruent to 5 mod 6 not in the original list. Therefore, contradiction. 

However, if k is even, then N ≡ 3 mod 6. Therefore, N is divisible by 3. Therefore, 3 is a prime factor. But 3 is not congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, in that case, the prime factors of N are 3 and others. However, since N = 2P + 1, and P is the product of primes congruent to 5 mod 6, then if N is divisible by 3, then 3 divides 2P + 1. Therefore, 2P ≡ -1 mod 3. Since P is the product of primes congruent to 5 mod 6, which are primes congruent to 5 mod 6. But 5 mod 6 is 5 mod 3, which is 2 mod 3. Therefore, each prime in the list is congruent to 2 mod 3. Therefore, P is the product of numbers congruent to 2 mod 3. Therefore, P ≡ 2^k mod 3. Therefore, 2P ≡ 2^{k+1} mod 3. So 2P ≡ -1 mod 3 ⇒ 2^{k+1} ≡ -1 mod 3. Let's see, 2^1 = 2 ≡ -1 mod 3, 2^2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3, 2^3 = 8 ≡ 2 mod 3, etc. Therefore, 2^{k+1} ≡ -1 mod 3 when k+1 is odd, i.e., when k is even. Therefore, if k is even, then 2^{k+1} ≡ -1 mod 3, which is exactly what we have. Therefore, this is consistent. Therefore, N = 2P + 1 is divisible by 3. Therefore, 3 divides N. Therefore, 3 is a prime factor. But 3 is not in the original list (since the original list is primes congruent to 5 mod 6). Therefore, again, N has a prime factor not in the list. However, since N ≡ 3 mod 6, which is 3, and 3 is not congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, this doesn't help us directly. But wait, if N is divisible by 3, then N is not prime, but if N is composite, then it has prime factors. However, if N is composite, then it has a prime factor not in the original list. However, that prime factor could be 3 or something else. But since we are trying to show that there is a prime congruent to 5 mod 6 not in the list, then this approach may not work in the case when k is even. 

But wait, if N is divisible by 3, then N = 3 * m, where m is an integer. Now, m could be 1, or it could be composite. If m is 1, then N = 3, which is prime. But 3 is not congruent to 5 mod 6. If m is composite, then m has prime factors. However, if m is not divisible by any of the primes in the original list, then it must have a prime factor not in the list. But m is N / 3, which is (2P + 1)/3. However, since N = 2P + 1, and P is the product of primes congruent to 5 mod 6, then m is (2P + 1)/3. If m is not divisible by any of the primes in the original list, then it must have a prime factor not in the list. However, m could be congruent to something else. But since N is congruent to 3 mod 6, m is (N)/3, which is congruent to 1 mod 2 (since N is 3 mod 6, which is odd, so m is odd). Therefore, m is an odd integer. However, m could be 1, which is not prime, or it could be composite. But if m is composite, then it has a prime factor not in the original list. However, that prime factor could be 3 or something else. But since we already have 3 as a factor, but 3 is not in the original list. Therefore, even if m is composite, it has a prime factor not in the original list. However, that prime factor could be 3 or something else. But if m is not divisible by 3, then it has a prime factor not in the original list. However, if m is divisible by 3, then N is divisible by 9, and so on. 

But this seems complicated. However, the key point is that regardless of whether k is even or odd, N = 2P + 1 has a prime factor not in the original list. If k is odd, then N is congruent to 5 mod 6, and any prime factor of N must be congruent to 5 mod 6 or 1 mod 6. But since N is not divisible by any of the primes in the original list, then any prime factor congruent to 5 mod 6 is not in the list. Therefore, there is such a prime. If k is even, then N is divisible by 3, which is not in the original list, so again, there is a prime factor not in the list. However, in this case, the prime factor could be 3 or another prime. But if N is divisible by 3, then 3 is a prime factor not in the list, so that's sufficient. Therefore, regardless of k, N has a prime factor not in the original list. Therefore, the proof works. 

Wait, but if N has a prime factor not in the original list, that prime could be 3 or something else. But since we are trying to show that there are infinitely many primes congruent to 5 mod 6, we need that there is a prime congruent to 5 mod 6 not in the original list. However, in the case when k is even, N is divisible by 3, which is not congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, that doesn't help. However, if N is divisible by another prime not in the list, which is congruent to 5 mod 6, then that would be good. But how do we know that?

Wait, if N = 2P + 1, and k is even, then N is divisible by 3. But suppose N is divisible by 3 and another prime q. Then q is a prime factor of N. If q is not in the original list, then it could be 3 or another prime. However, if q is not 3, then q divides N and q divides 2P + 1. Therefore, q divides 2P + 1 and q divides P? No, because if q divides P, then q divides 2P + 1 - 2P = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, q does not divide P. Therefore, q is not in the original list. Therefore, q is a prime not in the original list. However, q could be 3 or something else. But if q is not 3, then q is a prime not in the original list, which could be congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. However, if q is congruent to 1 mod 6, then that's not helpful. However, if q is congruent to 5 mod 6, then that's helpful. But how do we know that?

Wait, N = 2P + 1. If k is even, then N is divisible by 3, but N is also congruent to 3 mod 6. Therefore, N is 3 mod 6. Therefore, if N is divisible by 3, then N = 3 * m, where m is an integer. If m is 1, then N = 3, which is not congruent to 5 mod 6. If m is greater than 1, then m is an integer. Now, m could be 1, but if m is greater than 1, then m could be composite or prime. If m is prime, then it's a prime not in the original list. However, m is N / 3, which is (2P + 1)/3. Now, since N = 2P + 1, and P is the product of primes congruent to 5 mod 6, then m is an integer. Now, if m is prime, then m is not in the original list. However, m could be congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. If m is congruent to 5 mod 6, then that's good. If it's congruent to 1 mod 6, then it's not helpful. However, how do we know that m is congruent to 5 mod 6?

Alternatively, maybe m is congruent to something. Since N = 2P + 1 ≡ 3 mod 6, so m = N / 3 ≡ 1 mod 2 (since N is odd). Therefore, m is odd. So m is an odd integer. But m could be congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. However, how do we know?

Alternatively, maybe m is congruent to 1 mod 6 or 5 mod 6. But if m is not in the original list, then it's either 3 or something else. However, since we are assuming that the original list contains all primes congruent to 5 mod 6, then if m is a prime not in the list, it must be congruent to 1 mod 6 or 2 mod 3 (but since m is odd, it's 1 or 5 mod 6). 

But this seems too vague. However, the key point is that regardless of the value of m, if m is not in the original list, then there must be at least one prime factor not in the original list. However, the problem is that if m is 3, then it's not in the original list, but it's not congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, this approach might not directly give us a prime congruent to 5 mod 6. 

But wait, in the case when k is odd, N is congruent to 5 mod 6, and any prime factor of N is either congruent to 5 mod 6 or 1 mod 6. Since N is not divisible by any of the primes in the original list, then any prime factor congruent to 5 mod 6 is not in the list. Therefore, in this case, there must be such a prime. Therefore, in this case, we have a prime congruent to 5 mod 6 not in the list. 

However, when k is even, N is divisible by 3, but then m = N / 3. If m is composite, then it has a prime factor not in the original list. However, that prime factor could be 3 or something else. But if m is composite, then it must have a prime factor not in the original list. However, if that prime factor is congruent to 5 mod 6, then we are done. If it's congruent to 1 mod 6, then that's not helpful. However, since N = 2P + 1 is congruent to 3 mod 6, and m = N / 3 is congruent to 1 mod 2. So m is an odd integer. If m is prime, then it's either 3 or a prime congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. If m is 3, then it's not in the original list. If m is a prime congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6, then if it's 5 mod 6, then we are done. If it's 1 mod 6, then we need to consider that. 

But how can we ensure that there is a prime congruent to 5 mod 6 not in the list? 

Alternatively, maybe the construction of N = 2P + 1 is not sufficient, but if we consider both cases, when k is odd and even, then in the case when k is odd, we have a prime congruent to 5 mod 6 not in the list, and in the case when k is even, we have that N is divisible by 3, and m = N / 3 is either 1 or a composite number. If m is composite, then it has a prime factor not in the original list. However, that prime factor could be 3 or something else. But if it's something else, then it's either congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. However, since N = 2P + 1 is congruent to 3 mod 6, and m = N / 3 is congruent to 1 mod 2. If m is congruent to 1 mod 6, then it's a prime not in the list. However, if m is congruent to 5 mod 6, then it's a prime congruent to 5 mod 6 not in the list. Therefore, in either case, there is a prime not in the list. However, the problem is that if m is 1, then N = 3, which is not congruent to 5 mod 6. But if m is 1, then N = 3, which is a prime not in the list, but it's not congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, this doesn't help us with primes congruent to 5 mod 6. 

Therefore, this approach might not work. Maybe I need to think differently. 

Let me go back to the original idea of N = P - 1, where P is the product of primes congruent to 5 mod 6. If k is odd, then N ≡ 4 mod 6. Therefore, N is congruent to 4 mod 6, which is 2^2. Therefore, N is even, so divisible by 2. Therefore, 2 is a prime factor not in the original list. If k is even, then N ≡ 0 mod 6, so divisible by 2 and 3. Therefore, again, 2 and 3 are not in the original list. However, this doesn't give us a prime congruent to 5 mod 6. 

But wait, if I take N = P - 1, and if N is composite, then it has prime factors. If N is divisible by 2 or 3, then those are not in the original list. But if N is divisible by some other prime, say q, then q is not in the original list. However, q could be congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. If q is congruent to 5 mod 6, then we are done. If not, then we need to consider other primes. 

But how do we know that there is such a q? 

Wait, suppose that N = P - 1 is divisible by a prime q not in the original list. Then q is either 2, 3, or a prime congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. If q is 2 or 3, then it's not in the original list. If q is congruent to 1 mod 6, then it's not in the original list. If q is congruent to 5 mod 6, then it's not in the original list. Therefore, in any case, there is a prime not in the original list. However, the problem is that we need to show that there is a prime congruent to 5 mod 6 not in the list. Therefore, this approach might not work unless we can show that such a prime exists. 

But how? 

Maybe the key is that if N is divisible by a prime not in the original list, then that prime must be congruent to 5 mod 6 or not. But if N is congruent to 4 mod 6 (when k is odd), then N is 4 mod 6. Therefore, any prime factor q of N must be congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. Because if q is 2, then it's 2 mod 6, but N is 4 mod 6, so 2 divides N, but 2 is not congruent to 5 mod 6. If q is 3, then 3 divides N, but 3 is not congruent to 5 mod 6. If q is a prime congruent to 1 mod 6, then it's not in the original list. If q is a prime congruent to 5 mod 6, then it's not in the original list. Therefore, in either case, there is a prime not in the original list. But how do we know that there is a prime congruent to 5 mod 6 not in the original list?

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to use a different approach. Let me think. 

Maybe the original theorem (Theorem 3.6) is about primes of the form 6n + 1, and the method used is similar to Euclid's proof. So perhaps the user is referring to that. Let me try to recall. For primes of the form 6n + 1, the standard proof is to take the product of all such primes, add 1, and show that the result is not divisible by any of them, hence has a prime factor of the form 6n + 1. 

So perhaps for primes of the form 6n + 5, we can do something similar. Let me try. Suppose there are only finitely many primes of the form 6n + 5, say p₁, p₂, ..., pₖ. Let me consider the number N = (p₁p₂...pₖ) + 1. Now, N is congruent to 1 mod 6, since each p_i is 5 mod 6, so their product is 5^k mod 6, and adding 1 gives 5^k + 1 mod 6. If k is even, 5^k is 1 mod 6, so N is 2 mod 6. If k is odd, 5^k is 5 mod 6, so N is 6 mod 6, which is 0 mod 6. So N is either 0 or 2 mod 6. 

If k is odd, then N is 0 mod 6, so divisible by 2 and 3. If k is even, N is 2 mod 6, so divisible by 2 but not by 3. In either case, N is not divisible by any of the primes p_i, since if a prime p divides N, then p divides (p₁p₂...pₖ) + 1, so p divides 1, which is impossible. Therefore, N is not divisible by any of the p_i. Therefore, N must have a prime factor not in the list. However, this prime factor could be 2, 3, or other primes. If it's 2 or 3, then it's not in the list. If it's another prime, it must be congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. But since N is congruent to 0 or 2 mod 6, if it's congruent to 0 mod 6, then it's divisible by 2 and 3. If it's congruent to 2 mod 6, then it's divisible by 2. So in either case, the prime factors are 2, 3, or primes congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6. 

But this doesn't directly give us a prime congruent to 5 mod 6. However, if N is divisible by a prime congruent to 5 mod 6, then that's a prime not in the original list. If N is divisible by a prime congruent to 1 mod 6, then that's also not in the original list. But how do we know that there is a prime congruent to 5 mod 6?

This seems to be a problem. Maybe I need to adjust the construction. Let me think. What if I take N = (p₁p₂...pₖ) - 1? Then N is congr
