Okay, so I need to figure out the missing details in this proof about the infinitude of primes. Let me start by recalling the standard proof of the infinitude of primes. The usual approach is to assume there are finitely many primes, say p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ, then consider the number N = p₁p₂...pₙ + 1. This number N must have a prime factor not in the list, leading to a contradiction. But the given sketch is different. Let me parse the given proof step by step.

First, the assumption is that there are only finitely many primes, p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ. Then, let A be the product of any r of these primes. Then B is defined as p₁p₂...pₙ divided by A. So B would be the product of the remaining (n - r) primes. Wait, but the problem says "put B = p_l p₂ ··· pₙ / A". Wait, maybe there's a typo here? Let me check again.

The original says: "Let A be the product of any r of these primes and put B = p_l p₂ ··· pₙ / A". Hmm, maybe the subscript l is a typo? Maybe it's supposed to be p₁? Or maybe it's supposed to be p_{n - r + 1} or something? Wait, maybe it's supposed to be the product of the remaining primes after taking A? Let me think.

If A is the product of any r primes, then B would be the product of the remaining (n - r) primes. So if we take A as p₁p₂...p_r, then B would be p_{r+1}...pₙ. But the problem says "put B = p_l p₂ ··· pₙ / A". Maybe there's a typo here, and it should be B = (p₁p₂...pₙ)/A. That would make sense. So maybe the original problem had a typo, and B is the product of all primes divided by A. So assuming that, then B is the product of the primes not in A.

But then the next part says: "each p_k divides either A or B, but not both." Let me check that. If A is the product of some r primes, and B is the product of the rest, then any prime p_k is in either A or B, but not both. So if p_k is in A, then it divides A, and since it's not in B, it doesn't divide B. Similarly, if p_k is in B, then it divides B and not A. So that seems correct.

Then the next part says: "Because A + B > 1, A + B has a prime divisor different from any of the p_k which is a contradiction." Wait, let me think. If A and B are products of primes, then A + B is some integer. If A + B has a prime divisor, that prime must divide A + B. But since each prime divides either A or B, but not both, then if a prime divides A + B, it can't divide both A and B. But if it divides A, then it can't divide B, and vice versa. Therefore, if a prime divides A + B, it must divide A or B, but not both. But since A and B are products of primes, then any prime divisor of A + B must be a prime not in the original list? Wait, why?

Wait, let me think again. Suppose that there is a prime divisor of A + B. Let's call it q. Then q divides A + B, so q divides A + B. If q divides A, then since q divides A, then q divides A, but since q divides A + B, then q divides B as well? Wait, no. If q divides A and q divides A + B, then q divides (A + B) - A = B. Therefore, q divides B. But earlier, we said that each prime divides either A or B, but not both. Therefore, if q divides both A and B, that would contradict the previous statement. Therefore, q cannot divide both A and B. Therefore, if q divides A + B, it cannot divide both A and B, so it must divide neither? Wait, no. Wait, if q divides A + B, then it's possible that q divides A or q divides B, but not both. But if q divides A, then q divides A + B implies q divides B, which is a contradiction. Therefore, q cannot divide A or B? That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe I need to think again.

Let me take an example. Suppose A is 2*3 = 6, and B is 5*7 = 35. Then A + B is 6 + 35 = 41, which is prime. So 41 is a prime not in the original list {2, 3, 5, 7}. So in this case, the prime divisor of A + B is not in the original list. But how does that follow from the previous statements?

Wait, in the problem statement, they say that each p_k divides either A or B, but not both. So if we have a prime q that divides A + B, then q cannot divide both A and B. But if q divides A, then q divides A + B, so q divides B. But that contradicts the fact that q divides A but not B. Therefore, q cannot divide A. Similarly, if q divides B, then q divides A + B, so q divides A. Which contradicts that q divides B but not A. Therefore, q cannot divide A or B. But that would mean that q is a prime not in the original list. Because if q divides A + B, and q is not in the original list, then it's a new prime. Therefore, that's the contradiction.

But how do we know that q is not in the original list? Because if q were in the original list, then it divides A or B, but not both. But if q divides A + B, then it divides A or B, but not both. However, if q divides A, then q divides A + B implies q divides B, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no prime in the original list that divides A + B. Therefore, A + B must have a prime factor not in the original list. Therefore, contradiction. Hence, the assumption that there are finitely many primes is wrong.

But in the given sketch, the problem says "Because A + B > 1, A + B has a prime divisor different from any of the p_k which is a contradiction." So the key steps are:

1. A and B are products of primes, with A being r primes and B being the rest.

2. Each prime divides either A or B, but not both.

3. Therefore, A + B cannot be divisible by any of the primes p_k, hence must have a prime divisor not in the list.

But why is A + B > 1? Well, since A and B are products of primes, they are at least 2 and 2, so A + B is at least 4, which is greater than 1. But maybe they mean that A + B is greater than 1, so it must have a prime divisor. But if A + B is greater than 1, then it's at least 2, so it must have a prime divisor. But since none of the primes in the original list divide A + B, then that prime divisor is new, hence contradiction.

But wait, in the problem statement, the original proof is missing some details. Let me check again.

The problem says:

"Assume that there are only finitely many primes, say p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ. Let A be the product of any r of these primes and put B = p_l p₂ ··· pₙ / A. Then each p_k divides either A or B, but not both. Because A + B > 1, A + B has a prime divisor different from any of the p_k which is a contradiction."

So the problem is that in the definition of B, there's a typo. The original says "p_l p₂ ··· pₙ / A". Maybe it's supposed to be "p₁ p₂ ··· pₙ / A"? Because otherwise, if l is a specific index, it's unclear. For example, if l is the last prime, then B would be p_n / A, but that doesn't make sense unless A is a single prime. But since A is the product of any r primes, then B would be the product of the remaining primes. Therefore, it's likely that the original problem had a typo, and B is supposed to be the product of all primes divided by A. Therefore, assuming that, then the rest follows.

But the problem is that in the given proof, they didn't specify what r is. For example, r could be any number between 1 and n-1. But maybe they need to specify that r is chosen such that A and B are both products of primes. However, since A is the product of any r primes, and B is the product of the remaining primes, then regardless of r, as long as A and B are non-empty, which they would be if r is between 1 and n-1.

But maybe the problem is that the original proof is missing the step where A + B is constructed. Wait, in the standard proof, you take N = product + 1, but here they take A + B. However, in this case, A and B are products of primes. Let me check with an example. Suppose n = 3, primes 2, 3, 5. Let me choose r = 1, so A is 2, then B is (2*3*5)/2 = 15. Then A + B = 2 + 15 = 17, which is prime. So that works. Alternatively, if r = 2, A is 2*3 = 6, B is 5, then A + B = 11, which is prime. So in both cases, A + B is prime. So that seems to work. But why is A + B chosen? Because if you take A and B as products of different primes, then A + B is a number that can't be divided by any of the primes in the original list. Because if you suppose that a prime divides A + B, then it divides A or B, but not both, which would lead to a contradiction. Therefore, the prime must be new.

But why does A + B have to be greater than 1? Well, since A and B are both at least 2 (if n ≥ 2), then A + B is at least 4, which is greater than 1. So that's why they say A + B > 1. So that's a given.

But the problem is that the original sketch is missing some details. Let me check again.

The original sketch says:

"Assume that there are only finitely many primes, say p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ. Let A be the product of any r of these primes and put B = p_l p₂ ··· pₙ / A. Then each p_k divides either A or B, but not both. Because A + B > 1, A + B has a prime divisor different from any of the p_k which is a contradiction."

So the missing details are probably:

1. The definition of B is supposed to be the product of all primes divided by A. So that B is the product of the primes not in A.

2. The step where they explain that A + B cannot be divisible by any of the primes p_k. Because if a prime p_k divides A + B, then it divides A or B, but not both. However, if p_k divides A, then since p_k divides A + B, it must divide B, which contradicts the fact that p_k divides A but not B. Therefore, no prime p_k can divide A + B, so A + B must have a prime divisor not in the list, hence contradiction.

But the original sketch skips some of these steps. So the missing details are probably explaining why A + B cannot be divisible by any of the p_k. Also, the definition of B needs to be clarified. Also, maybe the choice of r? For example, why is r arbitrary? But in the proof, r is just any number between 1 and n-1, so that A and B are both non-empty. But maybe the original proof is using a specific value of r? However, the problem says "any r", so it's general.

Alternatively, maybe the original proof is using a different approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the original proof is not using the standard proof, but a different approach. For example, in the standard proof, you take the product of all primes and add 1. Here, they take A and B as products of different subsets. But why is that?

Alternatively, maybe the original proof is trying to show that A + B is coprime to all the primes, hence must have a new prime factor. Therefore, the missing details are the explanation of why A + B is coprime to all the primes.

Therefore, the missing details are:

- Clarifying that B is the product of the primes not in A.

- Explaining that if a prime divides A + B, then it cannot divide A or B, hence must be a new prime.

But the original sketch says "each p_k divides either A or B, but not both." So that's given. Then, since A + B is greater than 1, it must have a prime divisor. But since none of the p_k divide A + B, that prime divisor is not in the original list, hence contradiction.

Therefore, the missing details are probably the explanation of why A + B cannot be divisible by any p_k. So in the original sketch, they need to explain that if a prime p_k divides A + B, then it divides A or B, but not both, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, such a prime cannot exist, so A + B must have a prime factor not in the list.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the original proof is not using the standard method, but another method. Let me check again.

Wait, in the standard proof, you take N = p₁p₂...pₙ + 1. Then N is not divisible by any of the primes, so it must have a prime factor not in the list. Here, they are taking A + B, where A and B are products of different subsets of primes. But why is A + B not divisible by any of the primes? Because if a prime divides A + B, then it divides A or B, but not both. Therefore, if it divides A, then it divides A + B, so it divides B, which is a contradiction. Therefore, no such prime exists. Therefore, A + B must have a prime factor not in the list.

But how do we know that A + B is not 1? Well, since A and B are products of primes, they are at least 2 (assuming n ≥ 2). Therefore, A + B is at least 2 + 2 = 4, which is greater than 1. Therefore, A + B must have a prime factor.

Therefore, the missing details are:

- The definition of B as the product of the remaining primes after choosing A.

- The explanation that if a prime divides A + B, then it cannot divide A or B, hence must be a new prime.

But in the original sketch, the problem says "each p_k divides either A or B, but not both." So that is given. Then, since A + B is greater than 1, it must have a prime divisor. But since none of the p_k divide A + B, that prime divisor is new.

But why can't a prime divide both A and B? Because if a prime divides both A and B, then it divides their difference, which is A - B. But since A and B are products of different primes, their difference is not necessarily zero. Wait, but in this case, A and B are products of different primes, so they are coprime? Wait, if A is the product of some primes and B is the product of the rest, then A and B are coprime. Therefore, gcd(A, B) = 1. Therefore, any prime dividing A cannot divide B, and vice versa. Therefore, A and B are coprime. Therefore, A + B is a number that is coprime to both A and B. Wait, but if A and B are coprime, then any prime divisor of A + B cannot divide A or B. Because if a prime divides A + B and divides A, then it divides B, which is impossible. Therefore, A + B is coprime to both A and B. Therefore, A + B must have a prime factor not in the original list. Therefore, contradiction.

Therefore, the missing details are the explanation that A and B are coprime, hence A + B is coprime to both, so its prime factors are new.

But the original sketch says "each p_k divides either A or B, but not both." Which is true because A and B are coprime. Therefore, that's the key step.

Therefore, the missing details are:

1. The definition of B as the product of the remaining primes after choosing A.

2. The fact that A and B are coprime, hence any prime divisor of A + B cannot divide A or B, hence must be new.

But in the original sketch, maybe the problem is that they didn't specify that A and B are coprime. Therefore, the missing details are explaining that A and B are coprime, hence A + B is coprime to both, leading to the conclusion.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the original proof didn't specify that r is chosen such that A and B are non-empty. But since the problem says "any r", probably r is between 1 and n-1.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the original proof didn't mention that A and B are coprime. Therefore, the missing details are explaining that A and B are coprime, hence A + B cannot be divisible by any of the primes in the original list.

Therefore, in conclusion, the missing details are:

- B is the product of the primes not in A, hence A and B are coprime.

- Therefore, any prime divisor of A + B cannot divide A or B, hence must be a new prime.

Therefore, the original proof is missing the explanation that A and B are coprime, and hence A + B cannot be divisible by any of the primes in the original list.

So, in the given sketch, the missing details are:

1. Clarifying that B is the product of the primes not in A, making A and B coprime.

2. Explaining that since A and B are coprime, any prime divisor of A + B cannot divide A or B, hence must be a new prime.

Therefore, the final answer is that the missing details are the explanation that A and B are coprime, leading to A + B having a prime factor not in the original list.

But the problem says "Fill in any missing details in this sketch of a proof...", so maybe the user is supposed to write the missing parts. However, the user hasn't provided the exact text to fill in, but the original sketch is as given. Therefore, the user might have provided the sketch and wants the missing details filled in.

But since the user is asking me to think through the process, I need to make sure that I have identified the missing parts.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the original sketch says "put B = p_l p₂ ··· pₙ / A", which is likely a typo. So the missing detail is that B is defined as the product of all primes divided by A, i.e., B = (p₁p₂...pₙ)/A. Therefore, that is a missing detail.

Therefore, the missing details are:

1. B is defined as the product of all primes divided by A, i.e., B = (p₁p₂...pₙ)/A.

2. A and B are coprime, so any prime divisor of A + B cannot divide A or B, hence must be a new prime.

Therefore, the answer is that the missing details are the definition of B and the explanation that A and B are coprime, leading to the conclusion.

But the problem says "Fill in any missing details in this sketch of a proof...", so maybe the user is supposed to write the missing parts. However, since the user hasn't provided the exact text to fill in, but the original sketch is as given, I need to infer what is missing.

Alternatively, maybe the original sketch is missing the step where they choose A and B such that they are coprime, and then show that A + B is not divisible by any p_k.

But in any case, the key missing details are:

- The definition of B as the product of the remaining primes.

- The explanation that A and B are coprime.

- The reasoning that A + B must have a prime factor not in the list.

Therefore, the answer is that the missing details are explaining that B is the product of the remaining primes, hence A and B are coprime, so A + B cannot be divisible by any of the original primes, leading to a contradiction.

But since the user wants the final answer boxed, maybe the answer is just stating that the missing details are the definition of B and the coprimality, but since the question is to fill in the missing details in the sketch, maybe the answer is the explanation that A and B are coprime, hence A + B has a prime factor not in the list.

But given that the user hasn't provided the exact text to fill in, but the original sketch is as given, I think the missing details are the definition of B and the explanation of why A + B has a new prime factor.

However, since the user is asking for the missing details in the sketch, which is presented as:

"Assume that there are only finitely many primes, say p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ. Let A be the product of any r of these primes and put B = p_l p₂ ··· pₙ / A. Then each p_k divides either A or B, but not both. Because A + B > 1, A + B has a prime divisor different from any of the p_k which is a contradiction."

So the missing details are:

1. The definition of B is supposed to be the product of all primes divided by A, i.e., B = (p₁p₂...pₙ)/A. Hence, the typo in the original is corrected.

2. The explanation that since A and B are products of different primes, they are coprime, so any prime divisor of A + B cannot divide A or B, hence must be a new prime.

Therefore, the answer is that the missing details are the definition of B as the product of the remaining primes and the explanation that A and B are coprime, leading to the conclusion.

But since the user wants the final answer in boxed notation, maybe the answer is simply stating the missing parts. However, given that the user is likely expecting the answer to be the explanation that A and B are coprime, so that A + B has a prime factor not in the list. But since the problem says "fill in any missing details", and the original sketch is given, the answer is likely the explanation of why A + B has a prime divisor not in the list.

But since the user hasn't specified exactly what is missing, but given the original sketch, the missing details are:

- The definition of B as the product of the remaining primes (i.e., B = (p₁p₂...pₙ)/A).

- The explanation that since A and B are coprime, any prime divisor of A + B cannot divide A or B, hence must be a new prime.

Therefore, the missing details are these two points. However, since the user wants the final answer boxed, maybe the answer is simply that the missing details are the explanation that A and B are coprime, leading to the conclusion. But since the problem is in the style of a proof sketch, the answer is likely the explanation that A + B cannot be divisible by any of the primes, hence must have a new prime factor.

But since the user is asking for the missing details in the sketch, which is given, and the answer is to fill in those details, the answer is that the missing details are the definition of B and the explanation of why A + B has a new prime.

However, since the user is likely expecting a specific answer, and given that the original sketch is missing the definition of B and the explanation of coprimality, I think the answer is that the missing details are the definition of B as the product of the remaining primes and the explanation that A and B are coprime, hence A + B has a new prime factor.

But since the user wants the answer in boxed notation, maybe the answer is simply the statement that the missing details are the explanation that A and B are coprime, so that A + B has a prime factor not in the list. However, since the user might expect a more specific answer, but given that the original sketch is missing the definition of B, which is a critical part, and the explanation of coprimality.

But since the user is asking for the missing details in the sketch, and given that the original sketch says "put B = p_l p₂ ··· pₙ / A", which is likely a typo for B = (p₁p₂...pₙ)/A, then the missing detail is the definition of B.

Therefore, the answer is that the missing detail is the definition of B as the product of the remaining primes, making A and B coprime, hence A + B has a new prime factor.

But since the user wants the answer in boxed notation, perhaps the answer is the statement that the missing details are the definition of B and the coprimality.

But I think the answer expected is that the missing details are the explanation that A and B are coprime, hence A + B has a prime factor not in the list.

But given that the original sketch says "each p_k divides either A or B, but not both", which is true because A and B are coprime, then the missing detail is the explanation that A and B are coprime, hence A + B cannot be divisible by any p_k.

Therefore, the answer is that the missing details are the explanation that A and B are coprime, so that A + B cannot be divisible by any of the primes, leading to a new prime.

But since the user wants the final answer boxed, maybe the answer is simply stating that the missing details are the explanation that A and B are coprime, but since the user might want a more precise answer, I think the answer is that the missing details are the definition of B and the explanation that A and B are coprime.

But since the original sketch already says "each p_k divides either A or B, but not both", which is the coprimality, then the missing detail is the definition of B.

Therefore, the answer is that B is defined as the product of the remaining primes, making A and B coprime, hence A + B has a new prime factor.

But since the user is asking for the missing details in the sketch, and the sketch is missing the definition of B, the answer is that B is the product of the primes not in A, hence A and B are coprime.

But given the original sketch has a typo, the answer is that B is defined as the product of all primes divided by A, and that A and B are coprime.

But since the user might be expecting the answer to be the statement that the missing details are the explanation that A and B are coprime, leading to the conclusion, I think the answer is:

The missing details are that B is the product of the remaining primes after choosing A, making A and B coprime. Therefore, A + B has a prime divisor not in the original list, leading to a contradiction.

But since the user wants the final answer boxed, maybe the answer is simply stating that the missing details are the explanation that A and B are coprime, so that A + B has a new prime factor. However, since the user might expect a specific answer, and given that the original sketch is missing the definition of B, the answer is:

The missing detail is the definition of B as the product of the remaining primes, making A and B coprime. Hence, A + B has a prime factor not in the original list.

But since the user hasn't specified the exact answer format, but the original problem is in the style of a proof sketch, and the user is to fill in the missing details, the answer is that the missing details are the definition of B and the explanation that A and B are coprime.

However, since the user is likely expecting the answer to be the explanation that A + B has a prime divisor not in the list, the answer is that the missing details are the explanation that since A and B are coprime, any prime divisor of A + B cannot divide A or B, hence must be a new prime.

But since I need to put the final answer in a box, I think the answer is that the missing details are the explanation that A and B are coprime, so A + B has a prime factor not in the list. Therefore, the contradiction follows.

But since the user might want the answer to be the specific step, I think the answer is:

The missing details are that B is the product of the remaining primes after choosing A, making A and B coprime. Hence, A + B cannot be divisible by any of the original primes, leading to a contradiction.

But since the user wants the answer boxed, and the question is about filling in the missing details in the proof sketch, the answer is likely the explanation that A and B are coprime. However, since the problem is in the style of a proof, the answer is that the missing details are the explanation that A and B are coprime, hence A + B has a new prime factor.

But given that, I think the answer is:

The missing details are that B is defined as the product of the remaining primes, making A and B coprime, so that A + B has a prime divisor not in the original list.

But since I need to put the final answer in a box, and the question is about the infinitude of primes, the answer is likely the statement that the missing details are the explanation that A and B are coprime, leading to the conclusion.

However, since the user might expect a specific answer, and given that the original sketch is missing the definition of B and the explanation of coprimality, the answer is:

The missing details are that B is the product of the remaining primes, hence A and B are coprime, so that A + B has a prime divisor not in the list.

But since I need to put this in a box, I'll write the key missing step, which is the explanation that A and B are coprime, hence A + B has a new prime.

But since the user might have intended the answer to be the statement that the missing details are the definition of B and the coprimality, but since I have to choose, I'll go with the explanation that A and B are coprime, leading to the contradiction.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{\text{The missing details are that B is the product of the remaining primes, making A and B coprime, hence A + B has a prime divisor not in the original list.}}

But since the user might expect a more concise answer, maybe just stating that A and B are coprime, but since the instructions say to put the final answer within \boxed{}, and the answer is a statement, I think the answer is the explanation that A and B are coprime, leading to the contradiction.

But since the original problem is in Chinese or another language, and the user is translating, maybe the answer is simply that the missing details are the explanation that A + B has a prime factor not in the list.

But since I have to choose, I think the correct answer is the explanation that A and B are coprime, hence A + B has a new prime.

But given that the user is likely expecting the answer to be the statement that the missing details are the explanation that A and B are coprime, I'll write that in the box.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\text{The missing details are that B is the product of the remaining primes, making A and B coprime, hence A + B has a prime divisor not in the original list.}}
</think>

To complete the sketch of the proof of the infinitude of primes, we need to **fill in the missing logical steps** and clarify the definitions that lead to the contradiction.

---

### **1. Definition of B**

The sketch says:  
> "Let A be the product of any r of these primes and put B = p_l p₂ ··· pₙ / A."

This is **incomplete** and likely contains a **typo**. The correct definition of B should be:

> **B = (p₁p₂...pₙ) / A**, where A is the product of **r** of the primes, and B is the product of the **remaining (n - r)** primes.

This ensures that A and B are **coprime**—since they are products of disjoint sets of primes.

---

### **2. Coprimality of A and B**

Because A and B are products of different primes, they are **coprime**. That is, **gcd(A, B) = 1**.

This is a crucial step: any prime that divides **both A and B** would be a common prime factor, which is not possible because A and B are products of disjoint sets of primes.

---

### **3. Implication of A + B > 1**

Since A and B are products of primes, they are both at least 2 (assuming n ≥ 2). Therefore:

> **A + B > 1**, which means that **A + B is at least 4**, and hence has a prime divisor.

---

### **4. Why A + B Cannot Be Divisible by Any of the Original Primes**

Suppose a prime $ p_k $ divides **A + B**. Then $ p_k $ divides **either A or B**, but **not both**, as A and B are coprime.

- If $ p_k $ divides A, then it must also divide A + B, so it must divide B.
- But that would contradict the fact that $ p_k $ divides A and not B.

Similarly, if $ p_k $ divides B, it must also divide A.

Thus, **no prime $ p_k $ from the original list can divide A + B**.

---

### **5. Conclusion**

Since **A + B > 1**, it has a prime divisor. But **none of the original primes divide A + B**, so this prime divisor must be **a new prime not in the original list**.

This is a **contradiction**, because we assumed that there were **only finitely many primes**.

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\text{The missing details are that B is the product of the remaining primes, making A and B coprime, hence A + B has a prime divisor not in the original list.}}
$$
