Okay, so I need to confirm that the numbers 60, 78, and 84 can each be written as the sum of two primes in six, seven, and eight different ways respectively. The problem mentions that there's an even integer a that can be represented as the sum of two odd primes in n different ways, and for these specific numbers, n is 6, 7, and 8. 

First, I should recall that according to the Goldbach conjecture, every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Although this conjecture hasn't been proven for all even integers, it has been verified up to very large numbers. Since 60, 78, and 84 are all even numbers and not too large, I can assume that they can be expressed as the sum of two primes. But the task is to find how many different ways each can be written as such a sum.

Let me start with the first number, 60. I need to find all pairs of primes that add up to 60. Let me list primes less than 60 first. The primes less than 60 are:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59.

Now, since 60 is even, and the sum of two primes. Now, note that except for 2, all primes are odd. The sum of two odd numbers is even, so if both primes are odd, their sum is even. However, if one of them is 2 (the only even prime), then the other would have to be 60 - 2 = 58. Is 58 a prime? Let me check. 58 is even, so no, it's not prime. Therefore, all representations of 60 as the sum of two primes must be two odd primes. Therefore, I don't need to consider the case where one of the primes is 2. 

So, I need to find pairs of primes (p, q) such that p + q = 60, where p and q are odd primes. Since addition is commutative, (p, q) and (q, p) are the same pair, so I need to avoid counting duplicates. Therefore, I can assume p ≤ q and find all such pairs.

Let me start checking primes from the smallest:

Starting with p = 3: then q = 60 - 3 = 57. Is 57 prime? 57 divided by 3 is 19, so 3*19 = 57, so no, not prime.

Next p = 5: q = 60 - 5 = 55. 55 is 5*11, not prime.

p = 7: q = 60 - 7 = 53. 53 is a prime. So that's one pair: (7, 53).

p = 11: q = 60 - 11 = 49. 49 is 7², not prime.

p = 13: q = 60 - 13 = 47. 47 is prime. So (13, 47).

p = 17: q = 60 - 17 = 43. 43 is prime. (17, 43).

p = 19: q = 60 - 19 = 41. 41 is prime. (19, 41).

p = 23: q = 60 - 23 = 37. 37 is prime. (23, 37).

p = 29: q = 60 - 29 = 31. 31 is prime. (29, 31).

p = 31: q = 60 - 31 = 29. But 29 is less than 31, so this would be the same pair as (29, 31), which we already counted. So we can stop here since p is increasing and q is decreasing.

So that's 6 pairs: (7,53), (13,47), (17,43), (19,41), (23,37), (29,31). Wait, that's six pairs. So that's six ways. Therefore, 60 can be written as the sum of two primes in six ways. So that confirms the first part.

Okay, moving on to 78. Let me do the same process. First, list primes less than 78. The primes less than 78 are similar to before, but up to 73, 71, 79 is over, so up to 73. Let me list them:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73.

Again, since 78 is even, and we need two primes adding up to it. Again, since 2 is the only even prime, if we take 2, then the other number is 78 - 2 = 76, which is even, not prime. Therefore, all pairs must be two odd primes. So again, p ≤ q, and p is odd prime, q = 78 - p.

Let me start checking:

p = 3: q = 78 - 3 = 75. 75 is divisible by 5 (5*15), not prime.

p = 5: 78 - 5 = 73. 73 is prime. So (5,73).

p = 7: 78 - 7 = 71. 71 is prime. (7,71).

p = 11: 78 - 11 = 67. 67 is prime. (11,67).

p = 13: 78 -13 = 65. 65 is 5*13, not prime.

p = 17: 78 -17 = 61. 61 is prime. (17,61).

p = 19: 78 -19 = 59. 59 is prime. (19,59).

p = 23: 78 -23 = 55. 55 is 5*11, not prime.

p = 29: 78 -29 = 49. 49 is 7², not prime.

p = 31: 78 -31 = 47. 47 is prime. (31,47).

p = 37: 78 -37 = 41. 41 is prime. (37,41).

p = 41: 78 -41 = 37. Which is the same as (37,41), already counted.

So let's count the pairs:

(5,73), (7,71), (11,67), (17,61), (19,59), (31,47), (37,41). That's 7 pairs. Wait, that's seven. Therefore, 78 can be written as the sum of two primes in seven ways. So that's correct. Therefore, the second part is confirmed.

Now, moving on to 84. Let me do the same process. First, primes less than 84. The primes up to 83. Let me list them:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83.

Again, since 84 is even, and we need two primes adding up to it. Again, 2 is the only even prime, so 84 - 2 = 82, which is even, not prime. Therefore, all pairs are two odd primes. So again, p ≤ q, p is odd prime, q = 84 - p.

Let me start checking:

p = 3: 84 - 3 = 81. 81 is 9², not prime.

p = 5: 84 - 5 = 79. 79 is prime. (5,79).

p = 7: 84 - 7 = 77. 77 is 7*11, not prime.

p = 11: 84 - 11 = 73. 73 is prime. (11,73).

p = 13: 84 -13 = 71. 71 is prime. (13,71).

p = 17: 84 -17 = 67. 67 is prime. (17,67).

p = 19: 84 -19 = 65. 65 is 5*13, not prime.

p = 23: 84 -23 = 61. 61 is prime. (23,61).

p = 29: 84 -29 = 55. 55 is 5*11, not prime.

p = 31: 84 -31 = 53. 53 is prime. (31,53).

p = 37: 84 -37 = 47. 47 is prime. (37,47).

p = 41: 84 -41 = 43. 43 is prime. (41,43).

p = 43: 84 -43 = 41. Which is same as (41,43), already counted.

So let me count the pairs:

(5,79), (11,73), (13,71), (17,67), (23,61), (31,53), (37,47), (41,43). That's 8 pairs. Therefore, 84 can be written as the sum of two primes in eight ways. So that confirms the third part.

Therefore, all three numbers 60, 78, and 84 can be written as the sum of two primes in six, seven, and eight ways respectively. 

But just to make sure I didn't miss any pairs, let me double-check each number.

Starting with 60:

(7,53), (13,47), (17,43), (19,41), (23,37), (29,31). That's 6 pairs. Correct.

For 78:

(5,73), (7,71), (11,67), (17,61), (19,59), (31,47), (37,41). That's 7 pairs. Correct.

For 84:

(5,79), (11,73), (13,71), (17,67), (23,61), (31,53), (37,47), (41,43). That's 8 pairs. Correct.

Therefore, all three numbers are confirmed. 

Wait, but just to make sure, maybe there are other pairs that I missed? For example, for 84, when p=7, q=77, which is not prime. p=19, q=65, not prime. p=29, q=55, not prime. p=37, q=47, which is prime. p=41, q=43, prime. So that's correct. 

Similarly for 78: p=13, q=65, which is not prime. p=19, q=59, prime. p=23, q=61, prime. p=29, q=55, not prime. p=31, q=53, prime. p=37, q=41, prime. So that's correct. 

For 60: p=3, q=57, not prime. p=5, q=55, not prime. p=7, q=53, prime. p=11, q=49, not prime. p=13, q=47, prime. p=17, q=43, prime. p=19, q=41, prime. p=23, q=37, prime. p=29, q=31, prime. So that's 6 pairs. Correct.

Therefore, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the answer is confirmed.

**Final Answer**
The integers 60, 78, and 84 can be written as the sum of two primes in \boxed{6}, \boxed{7}, and \boxed{8} ways respectively.
</think>

To confirm that the integers 60, 78, and 84 can be written as the sum of two primes in 6, 7, and 8 different ways respectively, we proceed by systematically identifying all pairs of **odd primes** that sum to each number. Since all primes except 2 are odd, and the sum of two odd numbers is even, we only need to consider odd primes for these even numbers.

### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

We are given that:

- 60 can be written as the sum of two **odd primes** in **6** ways.
- 78 can be written as the sum of two **odd primes** in **7** ways.
- 84 can be written as the sum of two **odd primes** in **8** ways.

We will verify this by listing all such pairs of primes that sum to each number.

### **Step 2: Verifying 60**

List of primes less than 60:
$$
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59
$$

We consider only **odd primes** (excluding 2), and find pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p + q = 60$, with $p \leq q$ to avoid duplicates.

- $7 + 53 = 60$
- $13 + 47 = 60$
- $17 + 43 = 60$
- $19 + 41 = 60$
- $23 + 37 = 60$
- $29 + 31 = 60$

**Total: 6 pairs**

✅ **60 can be written as the sum of two primes in 6 ways.**

---

### **Step 3: Verifying 78**

List of primes less than 78:
$$
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73
$$

Again, we consider only **odd primes** and find pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p + q = 78$, with $p \leq q$.

- $5 + 73 = 78$
- $7 + 71 = 78$
- $11 + 67 = 78$
- $17 + 61 = 78$
- $19 + 59 = 78$
- $31 + 47 = 78$
- $37 + 41 = 78$

**Total: 7 pairs**

✅ **78 can be written as the sum of two primes in 7 ways.**

---

### **Step 4: Verifying 84**

List of primes less than 84:
$$
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83
$$

We again consider only **odd primes** and find pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p + q = 84$, with $p \leq q$.

- $5 + 79 = 84$
- $11 + 73 = 84$
- $13 + 71 = 84$
- $17 + 67 = 84$
- $23 + 61 = 84$
- $31 + 53 = 84$
- $37 + 47 = 84$
- $41 + 43 = 84$

**Total: 8 pairs**

✅ **84 can be written as the sum of two primes in 8 ways.**

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{6}, \boxed{7}, \boxed{8}
$$
