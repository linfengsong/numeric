Okay, so I need to prove that if n is an integer greater than 1 and not of the form 6k + 3, then n² + 2ⁿ is composite. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better. 

First, the problem says n > 1, so n is at least 2. Also, n is not of the form 6k + 3. That means n can be congruent to 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5 modulo 6, right? Because 6k + 3 would be 3 mod 6. So n can't be 3, 9, 15, etc. 

The goal is to show that for such n, n² + 2ⁿ is composite. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. So, I need to show that n² + 2ⁿ isn't prime for these n. 

Maybe I can consider different cases based on the residue of n modulo 6. Since n is not congruent to 3 mod 6, let's break it down into cases where n ≡ 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5 mod 6. Then, for each case, try to factor n² + 2ⁿ or show that it's divisible by some small number, hence composite.

Alternatively, maybe there's a general approach. Let me think. 

First, note that 2ⁿ is even for n ≥ 1, and n² is even if n is even, odd if n is odd. So n² + 2ⁿ is even + even = even, or odd + even = odd. Wait, so if n is even, then n² is even, and 2ⁿ is even, so their sum is even. If n is odd, then n² is odd, 2ⁿ is even, so their sum is odd. 

But if n is even, then n² + 2ⁿ is even. So if n is even and greater than 1, then n² + 2ⁿ is even and greater than 2, hence composite. Wait, but n is even. But n can be 2, 4, 6, etc. However, n cannot be 6k + 3, which is odd. So n is even or congruent to 1, 2, 4, 5 mod 6. Wait, but if n is even, then n is 0 mod 2. So if n is even, then n² + 2ⁿ is even. So if n is even and greater than 1, then n² + 2ⁿ is even and greater than 2, hence composite. Therefore, for even n, the expression is composite. 

But what about odd n? If n is odd, then n² + 2ⁿ is odd + even = odd. So it's an odd number. So we need to show that for odd n (which is not of the form 6k + 3), n² + 2ⁿ is composite. 

But n is odd and not of the form 6k + 3. Since n is odd, it can be 1, 5 mod 6. Because 6k + 1 and 6k + 5 are odd. So n ≡ 1 or 5 mod 6. 

So for n odd, n ≡ 1 or 5 mod 6. Let me check for these cases. 

First, let me check small values to see if there's a pattern. Let's take n = 2: even, n² + 2² = 4 + 4 = 8, which is composite. n = 3 is excluded. n = 4: even, 16 + 16 = 32, composite. n = 5: odd, 25 + 32 = 57, which is 3*19, composite. n = 6: excluded? Wait, n=6 is 6*1 + 0, so it's allowed. 6 is even, so n² + 2^6 = 36 + 64 = 100, composite. n=7: odd, 49 + 128 = 177. 177 divided by 3 is 59, so 3*59, composite. n=8: even, 64 + 256 = 320, composite. n=9: excluded (6*1 + 3). n=10: even, 100 + 1024 = 1124, which is even, composite. n=11: odd, 121 + 2048 = 2169. Let me check if that's composite. 2169 divided by 3: 2+1+6+9=18, which is divisible by 3, so 2169 / 3 = 723. So composite. 

So far, for n not of the form 6k + 3, n² + 2ⁿ is composite. But how to prove it in general?

So, for even n, we already have that n² + 2ⁿ is even and greater than 2, so composite. For odd n, which is either 1 or 5 mod 6, we need to show that n² + 2ⁿ is composite. 

So let's consider n odd. Let me think about modulo 3 or something. 

Alternatively, maybe factor n² + 2ⁿ. But factoring might be difficult. Alternatively, check if it's divisible by some small prime. 

Let me try to check modulo 3. Let's see. 

If n is odd, then n is either 1 or 5 mod 6, which is 1 or 5 mod 3. Wait, 1 mod 3 and 5 mod 3 is 2 mod 3. So n is either 1 or 2 mod 3. 

But 2ⁿ mod 3: 2^1=2 mod 3, 2^2=1 mod 3, 2^3=2 mod 3, 2^4=1 mod 3, etc. So 2ⁿ mod 3 is 2 if n is odd, 1 if n is even. 

Since n is odd, 2ⁿ ≡ 2 mod 3. 

Now, n² mod 3: if n ≡ 1 mod 3, then n² ≡ 1 mod 3. If n ≡ 2 mod 3, then n² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Wait, so regardless of n mod 3, n² ≡ 1 mod 3? Wait, no. Wait, if n is 0 mod 3, then n² is 0 mod 3. But n is odd and not 6k + 3. So if n is 1 or 5 mod 6, then n is 1 or 2 mod 3. So n² is 1 mod 3. Therefore, n² + 2ⁿ ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. 

Therefore, if n is odd and not 6k + 3, then n² + 2ⁿ is divisible by 3. Therefore, it's composite unless n² + 2ⁿ = 3. But n > 1, so n² + 2ⁿ is at least 2² + 2² = 8, which is greater than 3. Therefore, n² + 2ⁿ is divisible by 3 and greater than 3, hence composite. 

Wait, that seems like a solid argument. Let me check with the examples above. For n=5: 5² + 2^5 = 25 + 32 = 57, which is 3*19. For n=7: 49 + 128 = 177 = 3*59. For n=11: 121 + 2048 = 2169 = 3*723. So yes, divisible by 3. 

So for odd n, which is not 6k + 3, n² + 2ⁿ is divisible by 3, hence composite. 

Therefore, combining both cases:

If n is even, then n² + 2ⁿ is even and greater than 2, so composite.

If n is odd, then n² + 2ⁿ is divisible by 3 and greater than 3, so composite.

Therefore, for all n > 1 not of the form 6k + 3, n² + 2ⁿ is composite.

Wait, but let me check if n is 1. But n > 1, so n starts at 2. So that's okay.

But let me check n=1, even though it's excluded. n=1: 1 + 2 = 3, which is prime. But n=1 is not considered here. 

Another check: n=5, which is 5 mod 6, and we saw 57 is composite. n=7, 177 composite. n=11, 2169 composite. 

What about n=13? 13² + 2^13 = 169 + 8192 = 8361. Divided by 3: 8+3+6+1=18, which is divisible by 3. 8361 / 3 = 2787. So composite. 

So seems like the argument holds. 

But let me think again. Why is n² + 2ⁿ divisible by 3 when n is odd and not 6k + 3? Because n is odd, so n is 1 or 5 mod 6, which is 1 or 2 mod 3. Then n² ≡ 1 mod 3, and 2ⁿ ≡ 2 mod 3. So 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, yes, divisible by 3. 

So this works for all odd n not divisible by 3? Wait, but n can be 1 mod 3 or 2 mod 3. But in any case, n² is 1 mod 3. So regardless of n mod 3, as long as n is not 0 mod 3, n² is 1 mod 3. But n can be 0 mod 3? Wait, if n is 0 mod 3, then n is 3 mod 6, which is excluded. Since n is not of the form 6k + 3, so n cannot be 0 mod 3? Wait, no. Wait, 6k + 3 is 3 mod 6, which is 0 mod 3. So if n is not of the form 6k + 3, then n is not divisible by 3? Wait, no. For example, n=6k + 0, which is 0 mod 3. But n is allowed to be 0 mod 3 as long as it's not 6k + 3. For example, n=6 is allowed, which is 0 mod 3. So in that case, n is even, so we already handled that case. 

But for odd n, if n is not of the form 6k + 3, then n is either 1 or 5 mod 6, which is 1 or 2 mod 3. Therefore, n is not divisible by 3. Therefore, n² is 1 mod 3. Therefore, n² + 2ⁿ is 1 + 2 = 3 mod 3. 

So that's why for odd n not of the form 6k + 3, n² + 2ⁿ is divisible by 3. 

Therefore, combining both cases, even n gives even number, odd n gives multiple of 3, so composite. 

Therefore, the proof is done. 

But let me check if there's any possible case where n² + 2ⁿ could be 3, but since n > 1, n² + 2ⁿ is at least 2² + 2² = 8, so no. Therefore, the only way for n² + 2ⁿ to be prime is if it is 3, which is not possible here. 

Hence, the conclusion is that for n > 1 not of the form 6k + 3, n² + 2ⁿ is composite.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{composite}
</think>

To prove that for any integer $ n > 1 $ not of the form $ 6k + 3 $, the expression $ n^2 + 2^n $ is **composite**, we analyze the expression in two key cases: when $ n $ is **even** and when $ n $ is **odd**.

---

### **Case 1: $ n $ is even**

If $ n $ is even, then both $ n^2 $ and $ 2^n $ are even. Therefore, their sum $ n^2 + 2^n $ is also even.

- Since $ n > 1 $, $ n^2 + 2^n > 2 $, so the sum is an even number greater than 2.
- Hence, it is **not prime**, and therefore **composite**.

---

### **Case 2: $ n $ is odd**

If $ n $ is odd, then $ n \not\equiv 3 \pmod{6} $, so $ n \equiv 1 $ or $ 5 \pmod{6} $, which implies $ n \equiv 1 $ or $ 2 \pmod{3} $.

Let’s analyze $ n^2 + 2^n \mod 3 $:

- Since $ n $ is **odd**, $ 2^n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} $ (as powers of 2 cycle modulo 3: $ 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 1, 2^3 = 2, \dots $).
- Also, $ n^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $, because the square of any number not divisible by 3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.
- Therefore, $ n^2 + 2^n \equiv 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $.

This means that $ n^2 + 2^n $ is divisible by 3.

- Since $ n > 1 $, $ n^2 + 2^n > 3 $, so the number is divisible by 3 and greater than 3.
- Thus, it is **not prime**, and therefore **composite**.

---

### **Conclusion**

- If $ n $ is even, $ n^2 + 2^n $ is even and greater than 2, hence composite.
- If $ n $ is odd and not of the form $ 6k + 3 $, $ n^2 + 2^n $ is divisible by 3 and greater than 3, hence composite.

Therefore, for all integers $ n > 1 $ not of the form $ 6k + 3 $, the expression $ n^2 + 2^n $ is **composite**.
