Okay, so I need to prove that if p and q are primes with p ≥ q ≥ 5, then 24 divides p² - q². Hmm, let's start by recalling what 24 factors into. 24 is 8 times 3, so maybe I need to show that p² - q² is divisible by both 8 and 3. If that's true, then since 8 and 3 are coprime, their product 24 will divide p² - q². That seems like a good approach. Let me check if that's correct.

First, let me remember that p and q are primes greater than or equal to 5. So, they can't be 2 or 3, right? Because 2 and 3 are primes less than 5. Wait, but the problem says q ≥ 5, so both p and q are primes at least 5. Therefore, they are odd primes. Since all primes except 2 are odd, and since 2 is less than 5, p and q can't be 2. So both p and q are odd numbers. Therefore, p² and q² are both odd squares. Then, p² - q² would be odd minus odd, which is even. So that's at least divisible by 2. But we need to show it's divisible by 24, which is 8*3. So maybe I need to check divisibility by 8 and 3 separately.

Let me start with divisibility by 3. For that, I need to consider p² - q² modulo 3. Since p and q are primes ≥5, they can't be multiples of 3. Wait, except if they are 3 itself. But since q ≥5, q can't be 3. So p and q are primes ≥5, so they can't be divisible by 3. Therefore, p and q are congruent to 1 or 2 modulo 3. Let me recall that for any integer a not divisible by 3, a² ≡ 1 mod 3. Because:

If a ≡ 1 mod 3, then a² ≡ 1² ≡ 1 mod 3.

If a ≡ 2 mod 3, then a² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3.

So, regardless of whether p or q is congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3, their squares are congruent to 1 mod 3. Therefore, p² - q² ≡ 1 - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, p² - q² is divisible by 3. That takes care of the 3 part. Good.

Now, moving on to divisibility by 8. Let me think. Since p and q are both odd primes, they are both odd numbers. So, odd numbers can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. Let me consider p and q as odd numbers. Then, p² - q² can be factored as (p - q)(p + q). Since both p and q are odd, p - q and p + q are both even numbers. Let me check that. If p and q are both odd, then p - q is even because odd minus odd is even. Similarly, p + q is even because odd plus odd is even. Therefore, (p - q)(p + q) is the product of two even numbers, so it's divisible by 4. But we need to show divisibility by 8. So maybe we need to check whether (p - q)(p + q) is divisible by 8.

Let me think. Since both p and q are odd, let's consider their parity. Let me write p = 2k + 1 and q = 2m + 1, where k and m are integers. Then, p - q = 2(k - m) and p + q = 2(k + m + 1). Therefore, the product (p - q)(p + q) = 4(k - m)(k + m + 1). Therefore, the product is divisible by 4. Now, to check divisibility by 8, we need to check whether (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even. Because 4 times an even number is 8 times something.

So, (k - m)(k + m + 1). Let me think about whether this product is even. Let me note that k - m and k + m + 1 are two integers. Let me check if at least one of them is even. Let me think about parity. Let me consider the parity of k and m. Since p and q are primes ≥5, they are odd, so k and m can be any integers such that p and q are odd. However, the specific values of k and m might not be important. Let me think about the parity of (k - m) and (k + m + 1). Let me note that:

If k and m are both even or both odd, then k - m is even. If one is even and the other is odd, then k - m is odd. Similarly, let's check k + m + 1. If k and m are both even, then k + m is even, so k + m + 1 is odd. If k and m are both odd, then k + m is even, so k + m + 1 is odd. If one is even and the other is odd, then k + m is odd, so k + m + 1 is even. Therefore, in the case where k and m have the same parity (both even or both odd), then k - m is even and k + m + 1 is odd. Therefore, the product (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even * odd = even. In the case where k and m have different parities, then k - m is odd and k + m + 1 is even, so again the product is odd * even = even. Therefore, in either case, (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even. Therefore, the entire product (p - q)(p + q) is 4 times an even number, which is 8 times something. Therefore, divisible by 8. Therefore, p² - q² is divisible by 8. Therefore, since it is divisible by both 8 and 3, it is divisible by 24. Therefore, 24 divides p² - q². Therefore, the statement is proven.

Wait, but let me check with some examples to make sure. Let me take p = 7 and q = 5. Then p² - q² = 49 - 25 = 24. 24 divides 24, yes. Another example: p = 7, q = 7. Then p² - q² = 0, which is divisible by 24. p = 11, q = 7. 121 - 49 = 72. 72 divided by 24 is 3, so yes. p = 11, q = 5. 121 - 25 = 96. 96 /24 = 4. Also yes. How about p = 5, q = 5? 25 - 25 = 0, which is divisible by 24. What if p = 7, q = 3? Wait, but q must be ≥5. So q can't be 3. So all examples are okay.

Another example: p = 13, q = 11. 169 - 121 = 48. 48 /24 = 2. Yes. p = 13, q = 7. 169 - 49 = 120. 120 /24 = 5. Yes. So seems like all examples work. Therefore, the reasoning seems correct.

But let me check again the step where I said that (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even. Let me think again. Let me consider that p and q are odd primes ≥5, so they are odd numbers. Let me think about their residues modulo 2. Since they are odd, they are congruent to 1 mod 2. Therefore, p = 2k + 1, q = 2m + 1. Then, p - q = 2(k - m), p + q = 2(k + m + 1). Then, the product is 4(k - m)(k + m + 1). Now, the question is whether (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even. Let me note that k and m are integers. Let me think about the parity of k and m. Let me suppose that k and m are both integers. Let me think about whether k - m and k + m + 1 are even or odd. Let me note that:

Case 1: k and m are both even. Then, k - m is even (even - even = even). k + m + 1 is even + even + 1 = odd. Therefore, the product is even * odd = even.

Case 2: k and m are both odd. Then, k - m is odd - odd = even. k + m + 1 is odd + odd + 1 = even + 1 = odd. Therefore, again even * odd = even.

Case 3: k is even and m is odd. Then, k - m is even - odd = odd. k + m + 1 is even + odd + 1 = even + odd = odd + 1 = even. Therefore, odd * even = even.

Case 4: k is odd and m is even. Then, k - m is odd - even = odd. k + m + 1 is odd + even + 1 = odd + 1 = even. Therefore, again odd * even = even.

Therefore, in all cases, (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even. Therefore, 4 times even is 8 times something. Therefore, divisible by 8. Therefore, the conclusion is correct.

Therefore, since p² - q² is divisible by 3 and 8, it is divisible by 24. Therefore, 24 divides p² - q². Therefore, the statement is proven.

But wait, let me check if there is a case where p and q are both 5. Then p² - q² is 0, which is divisible by 24. If p and q are both 7, same thing. So that's okay. What if p and q are different? For example, p=7, q=5. Then 49 - 25 = 24. Which is 24. So 24 divides 24. So that's okay. Another example, p=11, q=7: 121 - 49 = 72. 72 divided by 24 is 3, so yes. So that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of p² - q² as (p - q)(p + q). Since p and q are both odd, p - q and p + q are both even. Let me think about their divisibility by 4. Let me note that if p and q are both odd, then p - q is divisible by 2, and p + q is divisible by 2. Now, if p and q are both congruent modulo 4, then p - q is divisible by 4, and p + q is divisible by 2. If they are not congruent modulo 4, then p - q is divisible by 2 but not 4, and p + q is divisible by 4. Wait, let me check that.

Let me consider p and q modulo 4. Since p and q are odd primes ≥5, they are either 1 or 3 mod 4.

Case 1: p ≡ q mod 4. Then p - q ≡ 0 mod 4, and p + q ≡ 2p mod 4. Since p is 1 or 3 mod 4, 2p is 2 or 2 mod 4. Wait, 2*1=2 mod 4, 2*3=6≡2 mod 4. Therefore, p + q ≡ 2 mod 4. Therefore, p + q is 2 mod 4. Therefore, (p - q) is divisible by 4, and (p + q) is 2 mod 4. Therefore, their product is divisible by 4*2=8.

Case 2: p ≡ -q mod 4. That is, p ≡ 3 mod 4 and q ≡ 1 mod 4, or vice versa. Then p - q ≡ 3 - 1 = 2 mod 4 or 1 - 3 = -2 ≡ 2 mod 4. So p - q is 2 mod 4, which is divisible by 2 but not 4. Then p + q ≡ 3 + 1 = 4 ≡ 0 mod 4. Therefore, p + q is divisible by 4. Therefore, the product (p - q)(p + q) is divisible by 2 * 4 = 8. Therefore, regardless of the case, (p - q)(p + q) is divisible by 8. Therefore, that's another way to see it. Therefore, p² - q² is divisible by 8. Therefore, combined with divisibility by 3, we get divisibility by 24.

Therefore, this seems to confirm the previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about modulo 8. Let me check for p and q odd. Since p is odd, p ≡ 1, 3, 5, or 7 mod 8. Similarly for q. Let me compute p² mod 8 and q² mod 8. Let's see:

If p is 1 mod 8: p² = 1 mod 8.

If p is 3 mod 8: 9 ≡ 1 mod 8.

If p is 5 mod 8: 25 ≡ 1 mod 8.

If p is 7 mod 8: 49 ≡ 1 mod 8.

Therefore, regardless of what odd p is, p² ≡ 1 mod 8. Similarly for q². Therefore, p² - q² ≡ 1 - 1 = 0 mod 8. Therefore, p² - q² is divisible by 8. Therefore, that's another way to see it. Therefore, since p² - q² is divisible by 8 and 3, it's divisible by 24. Therefore, that's even simpler.

Wait, this is a much more straightforward way. Since p and q are odd primes ≥5, so they are odd, so their squares are 1 mod 8. Therefore, their difference is 0 mod 8. Therefore, divisible by 8. And as before, since they are not divisible by 3, their squares are 1 mod 3, so difference is 0 mod 3. Therefore, 24 divides p² - q². Therefore, that's a more straightforward proof.

So maybe that's the way to go. Let me check that again. For any odd integer, square is 1 mod 8. Let me check with numbers. 1² = 1 mod 8. 3² = 9 ≡ 1 mod 8. 5² = 25 ≡ 1 mod 8. 7² = 49 ≡ 1 mod 8. Yes, that's right. Therefore, any odd number squared is 1 mod 8. Therefore, p² ≡ 1 mod 8, q² ≡ 1 mod 8, so p² - q² ≡ 0 mod 8. Therefore, divisible by 8. And as before, since p and q are not divisible by 3, their squares are 1 mod 3, so difference is 0 mod 3. Therefore, divisible by 3. Hence, divisible by 24. Therefore, this is a more straightforward way.

Therefore, the conclusion is that 24 divides p² - q².

But let me check if there is a case where p or q is 3. Wait, but the problem states that q ≥ 5, so q is at least 5. Therefore, p and q are primes ≥5, so they are not 3. Therefore, they are not divisible by 3. Therefore, p² ≡ 1 mod 3 and q² ≡ 1 mod 3, so difference is 0 mod 3. Therefore, that works.

Therefore, this seems like a solid proof. Therefore, the answer is that 24 divides p² - q².

But let me think again if there is any possible mistake here. For example, suppose p = 5 and q = 5. Then p² - q² = 0, which is divisible by 24. If p = 5 and q = 7, then 25 - 49 = -24, which is divisible by 24. If p = 7 and q = 5, same thing. If p = 11 and q = 7, 121 - 49 = 72, which is 3*24. So yes. So all examples check out.

Therefore, the conclusion is correct. Therefore, the proof is correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{24}
</think>

To prove that $ 24 \mid p^2 - q^2 $, where $ p \ge q \ge 5 $ and $ p, q $ are primes, we begin by analyzing the structure of the expression $ p^2 - q^2 $ and its divisibility properties.

---

### Step 1: Factor the Expression

We start with the identity:
$$
p^2 - q^2 = (p - q)(p + q)
$$
Since both $ p $ and $ q $ are primes and $ q \ge 5 $, they are **odd** numbers (as all primes greater than 2 are odd). Therefore, both $ p - q $ and $ p + q $ are **even** numbers.

Thus, the product $ (p - q)(p + q) $ is divisible by $ 2 \times 2 = 4 $. However, we need to show that it is divisible by **24**, which is $ 8 \times 3 $. So we will separately verify that the expression is divisible by both 8 and 3.

---

### Step 2: Divisibility by 3

Since $ p $ and $ q $ are primes and $ q \ge 5 $, neither is divisible by 3. Therefore, both $ p $ and $ q $ are **not divisible by 3**, so they are congruent to either 1 or 2 modulo 3.

We know that:
- $ 1^2 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $
- $ 2^2 \equiv 4 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $

So, for any integer $ a $ not divisible by 3, $ a^2 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $. Hence:
$$
p^2 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \quad \text{and} \quad q^2 \equiv 1 \mod 3
$$
$$
\Rightarrow p^2 - q^2 \equiv 1 - 1 = 0 \mod 3
$$
So, $ p^2 - q^2 $ is divisible by 3.

---

### Step 3: Divisibility by 8

Since $ p $ and $ q $ are **odd**, we can write $ p = 2k + 1 $, $ q = 2m + 1 $, where $ k, m $ are integers. Then:
$$
p^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4(k^2 + k) + 1
$$
$$
q^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 4(m^2 + m) + 1
$$
$$
\Rightarrow p^2 - q^2 = 4[(k^2 + k) - (m^2 + m)] = 4(k^2 + k - m^2 - m)
$$
So, $ p^2 - q^2 $ is divisible by 4.

Now, we examine the parity of $ (k^2 + k - m^2 - m) $. This is equivalent to:
$$
(k - m)(k + m + 1)
$$
This product is **even** because:
- Either $ k \equiv m \mod 2 $, so $ k - m $ is even.
- Or $ k \not\equiv m \mod 2 $, so $ k + m + 1 $ is even.

In either case, the product is even, so the entire expression is divisible by $ 4 \times 2 = 8 $.

Thus, $ p^2 - q^2 $ is divisible by 8.

---

### Step 4: Conclusion

We have shown that:
- $ p^2 - q^2 $ is divisible by 3,
- $ p^2 - q^2 $ is divisible by 8.

Since 3 and 8 are **coprime**, their least common multiple is $ \text{lcm}(3, 8) = 24 $, so:
$$
24 \mid p^2 - q^2
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{24}
