Okay, so I need to find all twin primes p and q = p + 2 such that the product pq minus 2 is also prime. Let me start by recalling what twin primes are. Twin primes are pairs of primes that are two apart, like (3, 5) or (5, 7). So, the problem is asking for twin primes where if you multiply them together and subtract 2, the result is also a prime number.

First, I should probably start by listing some twin primes and check the condition. Let me recall the twin primes. The first few twin primes are (3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31), (41, 43), (59, 61), (71, 73), and so on. Maybe I can check these one by one.

Starting with the first pair: p = 3, q = 5. Then pq - 2 is 3*5 - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13. 13 is a prime number. So that's a valid pair. So (3, 5) is one solution.

Next pair: p = 5, q = 7. Then pq - 2 is 5*7 - 2 = 35 - 2 = 33. 33 is not prime because it's divisible by 3 and 11. So that doesn't work.

Third pair: p = 11, q = 13. Let's compute 11*13 - 2. 11*13 is 143, minus 2 is 141. Is 141 prime? Let me check. 141 divided by 3 is 47, so 3*47 = 141. Not prime. So that doesn't work.

Next pair: p = 17, q = 19. 17*19 is... let me calculate that. 17*20 is 340, minus 17 is 323. Then 323 - 2 = 321. Is 321 prime? Let's check. 321 divided by 3 is 107, so 3*107 = 321. Not prime. So that's out.

Next pair: p = 29, q = 31. 29*31. Let me compute that. 29*30 is 870, plus 29 is 899. Then 899 - 2 = 897. Is 897 prime? Let's see. 897 divided by 3 is 299. 3*299 = 897. 299 is 13*23, so 897 is 3*13*23. Not prime.

Next pair: p = 41, q = 43. 41*43. Let me compute that. 40*43 = 1720, plus 1*43 = 43, so total 1763. Then subtract 2: 1763 - 2 = 1761. Check if 1761 is prime. Let me try dividing by 3: 1+7+6+1 = 15, which is divisible by 3. So 1761 / 3 = 587. So 3*587 = 1761. Not prime.

Next pair: p = 59, q = 61. 59*61. Let me compute that. 60*60 = 3600, so 59*61 is (60 - 1)(60 + 1) = 60² - 1 = 3600 - 1 = 3599. Then subtract 2: 3599 - 2 = 3597. Check if 3597 is prime. Let me check divisibility by 3: 3+5+9+7 = 24, which is divisible by 3. So 3597 / 3 = 1199. So not prime.

Next pair: p = 71, q = 73. 71*73. Let me compute that. 70*73 = 5110, plus 1*73 = 73, so total 5183. Then subtract 2: 5183 - 2 = 5181. Check if prime. Sum of digits: 5+1+8+1 = 15, divisible by 3. So 5181 / 3 = 1727. Not prime.

Hmm, so far only (3,5) worked. Let me check if there are any more twin primes beyond this. Let me check the next ones. The next twin primes after 71,73 are 101, 103; 107, 109; 137, 139; 149, 151; 179, 181; 191, 193; 197, 199; 227, 229; 239, 241; etc.

Let me check p = 101, q = 103. 101*103. Let me compute that. 100*103 = 10300, plus 1*103 = 103, so total 10403. Subtract 2: 10403 - 2 = 10401. Check if prime. Let me check divisibility by 3: 1+0+4+0+1 = 6, which is divisible by 3. 10401 / 3 = 3467. Not prime.

Next pair: p = 107, q = 109. 107*109. Let me compute that. 100*109 = 10900, 7*109 = 763, so total 10900 + 763 = 11663. Subtract 2: 11663 - 2 = 11661. Check if prime. Sum of digits: 1+1+6+6+1 = 15, divisible by 3. 11661 / 3 = 3887. Not prime.

Next pair: p = 137, q = 139. 137*139. Let me compute that. Maybe use (138 - 1)(138 + 1) = 138² - 1. 138² is 19044, so 19044 - 1 = 19043. Subtract 2: 19043 - 2 = 19041. Check if prime. Sum of digits: 1+9+0+4+1 = 15, divisible by 3. 19041 / 3 = 6347. Not prime.

Next pair: p = 149, q = 151. 149*151. Let me compute that. Again, (150 - 1)(150 + 1) = 150² - 1 = 22500 - 1 = 22499. Subtract 2: 22499 - 2 = 22497. Check if prime. Sum of digits: 2+2+4+9+7 = 24, divisible by 3. 22497 / 3 = 7499. Not prime.

Next pair: p = 179, q = 181. 179*181. Let me compute that. Maybe (180 - 1)(180 + 1) = 180² - 1 = 32400 - 1 = 32399. Subtract 2: 32399 - 2 = 32397. Check if prime. Sum of digits: 3+2+3+9+7 = 24, divisible by 3. 32397 / 3 = 10799. Not prime.

Next pair: p = 191, q = 193. 191*193. Let me compute that. Let's do 190*193 + 1*193. 190*193: 190*(200 - 7) = 190*200 - 190*7 = 38000 - 1330 = 36670. Then add 193: 36670 + 193 = 36863. Subtract 2: 36863 - 2 = 36861. Check if prime. Sum of digits: 3+6+8+6+1 = 24, divisible by 3. 36861 / 3 = 12287. Not prime.

Next pair: p = 197, q = 199. 197*199. Let me compute that. Again, (200 - 3)(200 - 1) = 200*200 - 200*1 - 3*200 + 3*1 = 40000 - 200 - 600 + 3 = 40000 - 800 + 3 = 39203. Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, 197*199 = (200 - 3)(200 - 1) = 200*200 - 200*1 - 3*200 + 3*1 = 40000 - 200 - 600 + 3 = 40000 - 800 + 3 = 39203. Then subtract 2: 39203 - 2 = 39201. Check if prime. Sum of digits: 3+9+2+0+1 = 15, divisible by 3. 39201 / 3 = 13067. Not prime.

Hmm, so up to here, only (3,5) worked. Let me check if there's a pattern here. Maybe I can think about the problem more generally. Let me consider twin primes p and p+2. Then pq - 2 = p(p + 2) - 2 = p² + 2p - 2. So we need p² + 2p - 2 to be prime.

Alternatively, maybe I can analyze the parity. Since p is a prime greater than 2, it must be odd. So p is odd, so p + 2 is also odd. Therefore, both p and q are odd primes. Therefore, their product pq is odd*odd = odd. Then pq - 2 is odd - even = odd. So pq - 2 is odd, which is fine because primes except 2 are odd. However, since pq - 2 is supposed to be prime, it could be 2 or an odd prime. But let's check if it can be 2.

So, pq - 2 = 2 => pq = 4. Since p and q are primes with q = p + 2. Let's see, p and p + 2 are primes. The only way pq = 4 is if p = 2 and q = 2, but q = p + 2 would be 4, which is not prime. So pq = 4 is impossible. Therefore, pq - 2 must be an odd prime. Therefore, pq - 2 is an odd prime, so it's at least 3.

So, let's think about p² + 2p - 2. Let me check for small primes. For p=3: 9 + 6 - 2 = 13, prime. For p=5: 25 + 10 - 2 = 33, not prime. For p=7: 49 + 14 - 2 = 61, which is prime. Wait, hold on! Wait, p=7, q=9? But 9 is not prime. Wait, no. Wait, p=7, q=9 is not a twin prime. Wait, twin primes are pairs where both are primes. So p=7, q=9 is not valid because 9 is not prime. So actually, p=7 is part of the twin prime pair (7, 9)? No, 9 is not prime. So the twin primes after (5,7) are (11,13). So p=7 is not part of a twin prime pair? Wait, no. Wait, 7 and 5 are twin primes. Wait, twin primes are pairs like (3,5), (5,7), (11,13), etc. So p=5 and q=7 is a twin prime pair. Then p=7 is not part of a twin prime pair because the next prime after 7 is 11, which is 4 apart. So p=7 is not part of a twin prime pair. Therefore, when I considered p=7, q=9 is not a twin prime pair. Therefore, maybe I need to check only twin primes where p and q are both primes. Therefore, in my earlier check, when I checked p=5, q=7, that was valid. Then p=7 is not part of a twin prime pair. So maybe I need to check only the twin primes. So when I checked p=7, it's not part of a twin prime pair, so I shouldn't consider it. Therefore, my previous checks were correct.

But maybe there is another approach. Let me think about modulo arithmetic. Since p and p + 2 are primes. Let me think about p modulo 3. Since primes greater than 3 are congruent to 1 or 2 modulo 3. Let me check.

If p is a prime greater than 3, then p is either 1 or 2 mod 3. Then q = p + 2. If p ≡ 1 mod 3, then q ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, q would be divisible by 3. Since q is a prime, then q must be 3. Therefore, if p ≡ 1 mod 3, then q = 3. Therefore, p = 3 - 2 = 1, which is not prime. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, if p ≡ 1 mod 3, then q is divisible by 3, but since q is a prime, it must be 3. Therefore, p must be 1, which is not prime. Therefore, the only possibility is that p ≡ 2 mod 3, which would make q = p + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, in that case, p ≡ 2 mod 3 and q ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, for twin primes greater than 3, one of them is 1 mod 3 and the other is 2 mod 3. Therefore, in that case, p and q cannot be both 0 mod 3. So, for twin primes greater than 3, they are not divisible by 3. Therefore, maybe this can help us in some way.

But how does this relate to pq - 2? Let me compute pq - 2 modulo 3. Let me see. If p ≡ 2 mod 3 and q ≡ 1 mod 3, then pq ≡ 2*1 = 2 mod 3. Then pq - 2 ≡ 2 - 2 = 0 mod 3. Therefore, pq - 2 is divisible by 3. Therefore, if pq - 2 is prime, then it must be equal to 3. Therefore, pq - 2 = 3 => pq = 5. But p and q are primes with q = p + 2. So pq = 5. The only primes that multiply to 5 are 1 and 5, but 1 is not prime. Therefore, there is no solution here. Therefore, unless pq - 2 is 3, which is impossible, then pq - 2 is divisible by 3 and greater than 3, hence not prime. Therefore, for twin primes p and q where p ≡ 2 mod 3 and q ≡ 1 mod 3 (i.e., twin primes greater than 3), pq - 2 is divisible by 3 and greater than 3, hence not prime. Therefore, the only possible case where pq - 2 is prime is when pq - 2 is 3, which is impossible, or when the twin primes are such that p or q is 3. Let me check that.

So, if p is 3, then q = 5. Then pq - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13, which is prime. That's the case we already found. If q is 3, then p = 1, which is not prime. Therefore, the only possible case where pq - 2 is prime is when p = 3, q = 5.

Wait, but let me check if there are other possibilities where pq - 2 is not divisible by 3. But according to the previous reasoning, for twin primes greater than 3, pq - 2 is divisible by 3. Therefore, the only possible case where pq - 2 is not divisible by 3 is when one of the primes is 3. So, if p is 3, then q is 5. Then, as we saw, pq - 2 is 13, which is prime. If q is 3, then p is 1, which is not prime. Therefore, the only twin prime pair where pq - 2 is prime is (3,5). Therefore, the answer is (3,5). But wait, let me check if there are twin primes where p is 2. But twin primes are pairs of primes with difference 2. The only even prime is 2. So if p = 2, then q = 4, which is not prime. Therefore, there are no twin primes with p = 2. Therefore, the only possible twin prime pair is (3,5). Therefore, the answer is (3,5). But let me check if there's any other case where pq - 2 is prime. Wait, maybe when p is 3, q is 5, and pq - 2 is 13. What about if p is 5, q is 7? Then pq - 2 is 33, which is not prime. But according to the previous reasoning, for twin primes greater than 3, pq - 2 is divisible by 3. So for p = 5, which is ≡ 2 mod 3 (since 5 mod 3 is 2), then q = 7 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, pq - 2 is divisible by 3. Which is 33, which is 3*11. So that's correct. Similarly, for p = 11, which is 2 mod 3 (11 mod 3 is 2), then q = 13 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, pq - 2 is divisible by 3. Which is 141, which is 3*47. So that's correct. Therefore, the only case where pq - 2 is not divisible by 3 is when one of the primes is 3. Therefore, only (3,5) works. Therefore, the answer is (3,5). Therefore, the only twin primes p and q = p + 2 for which pq - 2 is also prime is (3,5). Therefore, the answer is \boxed{(3, 5)}.

But wait, let me check if there are any other twin primes where p is 3. But p=3, q=5 is the only twin prime pair where p=3. Because the next twin prime pair after that is (5,7). So, I think that's the only one. Therefore, the conclusion is that the only such twin primes are 3 and 5.

But wait, let me check p=3, q=5. Then pq - 2 = 13, which is prime. What if there's another twin prime pair where p is 3? No, because twin primes are pairs where the primes are two apart. So p=3 and q=5 is the only one where p=3. Therefore, yes, that's the only one. Therefore, the answer is (3,5).

But let me check for p=3, q=5. Is there any other twin prime pair where pq - 2 is prime? According to the previous reasoning, no, because for all other twin primes greater than 3, pq - 2 is divisible by 3, hence not prime. Therefore, the only solution is (3,5).

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{(3, 5)}.

**Final Answer**
The twin primes are \boxed{(3, 5)}.
</think>

To determine all twin primes $ p $ and $ q = p + 2 $ such that $ pq - 2 $ is also prime, we begin by understanding the structure of the problem.

---

### Step 1: Understanding Twin Primes

Twin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 2. Examples include:

- (3, 5)
- (5, 7)
- (11, 13)
- (17, 19)
- (29, 31)
- (41, 43)
- (59, 61)
- (71, 73)
- and so on.

We are to find all such pairs where the expression $ pq - 2 $ is also a prime number.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Expression $ pq - 2 $

Let $ p $ and $ q = p + 2 $ be twin primes. Then:

$$
pq - 2 = p(p + 2) - 2 = p^2 + 2p - 2
$$

We must determine when this expression is a prime number.

---

### Step 3: Check Small Twin Primes

Let’s evaluate $ pq - 2 $ for the first few twin primes:

- **(3, 5)**:  
  $ 3 \times 5 - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13 $, which is prime.

- **(5, 7)**:  
  $ 5 \times 7 - 2 = 35 - 2 = 33 $, which is not prime (divisible by 3).

- **(11, 13)**:  
  $ 11 \times 13 - 2 = 143 - 2 = 141 $, not prime.

- **(17, 19)**:  
  $ 17 \times 19 - 2 = 323 - 2 = 321 $, not prime.

- **(29, 31)**:  
  $ 29 \times 31 - 2 = 899 - 2 = 897 $, not prime.

- **(41, 43)**:  
  $ 41 \times 43 - 2 = 1763 - 2 = 1761 $, not prime.

From this, it appears that only the pair **(3, 5)** satisfies the condition.

---

### Step 4: General Reasoning Using Modular Arithmetic

Let’s analyze the expression $ pq - 2 $ modulo 3.

For twin primes $ p $ and $ q = p + 2 $, we consider:

- If $ p \equiv 2 \mod 3 $, then $ q = p + 2 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $.
- Then $ pq \equiv 2 \times 1 = 2 \mod 3 $, so $ pq - 2 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $.
- Therefore, $ pq - 2 $ is divisible by 3.

This implies that for **any twin primes greater than 3**, $ pq - 2 $ is divisible by 3. Since $ pq - 2 $ is greater than 3, it cannot be prime.

Hence, the only possible case where $ pq - 2 $ is prime is when **either $ p = 3 $ or $ q = 3 $**, but:

- $ q = p + 2 = 3 \Rightarrow p = 1 $, not prime.
- $ p = 3 \Rightarrow q = 5 $, which is valid.

So the only valid pair is $ (3, 5) $, and we have already verified that:

$$
pq - 2 = 3 \times 5 - 2 = 13
$$

which is a prime number.

---

### Final Conclusion

The only twin prime pair $ (p, q) $ such that $ pq - 2 $ is also prime is:

$$
\boxed{(3, 5)}
$$
