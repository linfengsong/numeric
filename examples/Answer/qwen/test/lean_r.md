Okay, I need to prove that cos(π/7) - cos(2π/7) + cos(3π/7) equals 1/2 using Lean 4. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that trigonometric identities can sometimes be tackled by using complex numbers or roots of unity. Since the angles are multiples of π/7, maybe there's a connection with the 7th roots of unity. 

Let me recall that the sum of all 7th roots of unity is zero. The roots are e^(2πik/7) for k from 0 to 6. But how does that relate to the cosines here?

Alternatively, maybe I can use some trigonometric identities. Let me write down the expression:

cos(π/7) - cos(2π/7) + cos(3π/7). 

Hmm, maybe I can combine these terms. Let me think about using sum-to-product formulas or other identities. 

Another approach: Let me denote θ = π/7. Then the expression becomes cosθ - cos2θ + cos3θ. Since θ = π/7, 3θ = 3π/7, and 2θ is 2π/7. 

Let me compute this expression. Maybe I can find a way to express it in terms of known values or relate it to some equation. 

Alternatively, I remember that there's a known identity for this specific sum. But how to derive it?

Alternatively, consider using complex exponentials. Let me write each cosine as the real part of e^{iθ}. So:

cosθ - cos2θ + cos3θ = Re(e^{iθ} - e^{i2θ} + e^{i3θ}).

But maybe I can find a relationship between these terms. Let me think about the sum of roots of unity. 

The 7th roots of unity are 1, e^{2πi/7}, e^{4πi/7}, e^{6πi/7}, e^{8πi/7}, e^{10πi/7}, e^{12πi/7}. But θ is π/7, so maybe not directly. Wait, but 2πi/7 is 2θ, since θ is π/7. So maybe the sum of certain roots?

Alternatively, perhaps consider the real parts. Let me think about the sum of e^{iθ} + e^{i2θ} + e^{i3θ} + ... but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe consider that cos(π/7) - cos(2π/7) + cos(3π/7) can be related to some equation. Let me try to compute this numerically to check. 

Let me compute the value approximately. 

π ≈ 3.1416, so π/7 ≈ 0.4488 radians. 

cos(π/7) ≈ cos(0.4488) ≈ 0.90097

cos(2π/7) ≈ cos(0.8976) ≈ 0.62349

cos(3π/7) ≈ cos(1.3464) ≈ 0.2225

So the expression is 0.90097 - 0.62349 + 0.2225 ≈ 0.90097 - 0.62349 is 0.27748 + 0.2225 ≈ 0.49998, which is approximately 0.5. So the identity holds. 

So I need to prove this algebraically. 

Another thought: Maybe use the identity for cos A + cos B + cos C in some context. Or perhaps consider that the sum is related to the real part of some complex number. 

Alternatively, let me consider the equation for cos(π/7), cos(2π/7), cos(3π/7). There's a known equation that these satisfy. For example, I recall that cos(π/7), cos(3π/7), cos(5π/7) are roots of some cubic equation. Let me check that. 

Let me recall that for θ = π/7, 2θ = 2π/7, 3θ = 3π/7, 4θ = 4π/7, etc. But perhaps using multiple-angle formulas. 

Alternatively, consider that 7θ = π, so θ = π/7. Let me use the identity for cos(7θ). Since 7θ = π, cos(7θ) = cos π = -1. 

But cos(7θ) can be expanded using multiple-angle formulas. Let me recall that cos(7θ) can be expressed in terms of cosθ. 

Alternatively, using the formula for cos(7θ) in terms of cosθ. 

But this might get complicated. Let me try to find an equation that cosθ satisfies. 

Let me denote x = cosθ. Then, using the multiple-angle formula for cos(7θ). 

But I need to find an equation that x satisfies. 

Alternatively, since 7θ = π, then 7θ = π, so θ = π/7. 

Let me use the identity for cos(7θ) = -1. 

Expanding cos(7θ) using multiple-angle formulas. 

But this might be tedious. However, there's a formula for cos(nθ) in terms of cosθ. 

Alternatively, I can use the identity for cos(7θ) in terms of cosθ. Let me recall that cos(7θ) can be written as 64 cos^7θ - 112 cos^5θ + 56 cos^3θ - 7 cosθ. 

Wait, I think that's the formula for cos(7θ). Let me check for n=7. 

Yes, the general formula for cos(nθ) can be expressed as a polynomial in cosθ. For example, for n=7, the expansion is:

cos(7θ) = 64 cos^7θ - 112 cos^5θ + 56 cos^3θ - 7 cosθ.

Since 7θ = π, cos(7θ) = cos π = -1. Therefore:

64x^7 - 112x^5 + 56x^3 -7x = -1, where x = cosθ.

Rearranging:

64x^7 - 112x^5 + 56x^3 -7x +1 = 0.

But since θ = π/7, x = cos(π/7) is a root of this equation. However, this is a 7th-degree equation. But maybe we can factor it. 

Note that cos(π) = -1, which is also a root. But θ = π/7, so 7θ = π. However, other roots would correspond to other angles. 

But perhaps we can factor out (x + 1). Let me try dividing the polynomial by (x + 1). 

Alternatively, note that cos(π/7), cos(3π/7), cos(5π/7) are roots of a cubic equation. Let me check that. 

Alternatively, since cos(π - x) = -cos x. So cos(5π/7) = cos(π - 2π/7) = -cos(2π/7). Similarly, cos(π - 3π/7) = cos(4π/7) = -cos(3π/7). 

So the roots of the equation cos(7θ) = -1 are θ = π/7, 3π/7, 5π/7, etc. But since cos(π - θ) = -cosθ, perhaps the equation can be factored into (x + 1) times a 6th-degree polynomial, but that seems complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be factored into (x + 1)(some polynomial) = 0. Let me try to perform polynomial division. 

Let me write the polynomial as 64x^7 - 112x^5 + 56x^3 -7x +1. Let me check if x = -1 is a root. Plugging x = -1:

64(-1)^7 - 112(-1)^5 + 56(-1)^3 -7(-1) +1 = -64 + 112 -56 +7 +1 = (-64 + 112) = 48; 48 -56 = -8; -8 +7 = -1; -1 +1 = 0. Yes, so x = -1 is a root. Therefore, (x + 1) is a factor. 

Let me perform polynomial division. Dividing the polynomial by (x + 1). 

Alternatively, since this is getting complicated, maybe there's another way. Let me think again about the original problem. 

We need to compute cos(π/7) - cos(2π/7) + cos(3π/7). Let me denote this as S. 

Let me consider that S = cos(π/7) + cos(3π/7) - cos(2π/7). 

I remember that there's a formula for the sum of cosines with angles in arithmetic progression. But here, the angles are not in arithmetic progression. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use some symmetry. Let me think about the sum S. 

Alternatively, consider that 3π/7 = π/2 - π/14, but not sure if that helps. 

Alternatively, maybe consider using the identity for the sum of cosines. Let me think of S as cos(π/7) + cos(3π/7) - cos(2π/7). 

Alternatively, let me consider that cos(π/7) + cos(3π/7) + cos(5π/7) = 1/2. Wait, I think that's a known identity. Let me check. 

If that's the case, then since cos(5π/7) = -cos(2π/7), then cos(π/7) + cos(3π/7) - cos(2π/7) = 1/2. Which is exactly our S. So that would mean that S = 1/2. 

So if I can prove that cos(π/7) + cos(3π/7) + cos(5π/7) = 1/2, then since cos(5π/7) = -cos(2π/7), substituting gives the desired result. 

So how to prove that sum? 

Let me think about the sum of cos(kπ/7) for k=1 to 6. But that's related to the real part of the sum of the 7th roots of unity. 

The sum of the 7th roots of unity is zero. The roots are e^{2πik/7} for k=0 to 6. The real part of this sum is zero. 

The real part is 1 + 2[cos(2π/7) + cos(4π/7) + cos(6π/7)] = 0. 

So, cos(2π/7) + cos(4π/7) + cos(6π/7) = -1/2. 

But note that cos(6π/7) = cos(π - π/7) = -cos(π/7), similarly cos(4π/7) = cos(π - 3π/7) = -cos(3π/7), and cos(2π/7) remains as is. 

So substituting:

cos(2π/7) - cos(3π/7) - cos(π/7) = -1/2. 

Rearranging:

cos(π/7) + cos(3π/7) - cos(2π/7) = 1/2. 

Which is exactly our S. Therefore, this proves the identity. 

So the key idea is to use the fact that the sum of the real parts of the 7th roots of unity is zero, leading to the equation involving the cosines. 

Now, how to translate this into Lean 4 code. 

The theorem is to be proven using the Mathlib library. 

First, I need to import the necessary modules. The original code has import Mathlib and Aesop, but maybe that's not needed. 

But the user's code starts with:

import Mathlib
import Aesop
set_option maxHeartbeats 0
open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
/– Prove that cos(π/7) - cos(2π/7) + cos(3π/7) = 1/2.-/
theorem imo_1963_p5 : Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) = 1 / 2 := by
sorry

So the task is to fill in the proof. 

The approach is to use the identity derived above. 

In Lean, we can use the fact that the sum of the real parts of the 7th roots of unity is zero. 

Let me think about how to express that. 

The 7th roots of unity are e^(2πik/7) for k from 0 to 6. The sum is zero. 

The real part of this sum is 1 + 2[cos(2π/7) + cos(4π/7) + cos(6π/7)] = 0. 

So, cos(2π/7) + cos(4π/7) + cos(6π/7) = -1/2. 

But cos(6π/7) = -cos(π/7), cos(4π/7) = -cos(3π/7), and cos(2π/7) remains. 

So substituting:

cos(2π/7) - cos(3π/7) - cos(π/7) = -1/2 

Rearranged:

cos(π/7) + cos(3π/7) - cos(2π/7) = 1/2 

Which is exactly the desired expression. 

Therefore, the proof can be structured as follows: 

1. Use the fact that the sum of the 7th roots of unity is zero. 

2. Take the real part of this sum. 

3. Express the sum as 1 + 2*(sum of cos(2πk/7) for k=1 to 3). 

4. Then, substitute the values of the cosines using identities. 

So, in Lean, I need to formalize this. 

First, I need to import the necessary modules. The user has already imported Mathlib and Aesop, but maybe some other modules are needed. 

But in the code, the open statements include BigOperators, Real, Nat, Topology, Rat. 

So, the plan is to use the sum of roots of unity. 

In Mathlib, the roots of unity can be handled using the Complex or Real modules. 

Alternatively, since we are dealing with real numbers, perhaps we can use the fact that the sum of the real parts of the roots of unity is zero. 

Let me think about how to express that. 

Let me define the sum of the real parts of the 7th roots of unity. 

The 7th roots of unity are e^(2πik/7) for k=0,...,6. 

The sum is 0. 

The real part of this sum is the sum of cos(2πik/7) for k=0 to 6. 

Which is equal to 1 + 2[cos(2π/7) + cos(4π/7) + cos(6π/7)] = 0. 

Therefore, the sum of cos(2π/7) + cos(4π/7) + cos(6π/7) = -1/2. 

But cos(6π/7) = cos(π - π/7) = -cos(π/7). Similarly, cos(4π/7) = cos(π - 3π/7) = -cos(3π/7), and cos(2π/7) is as is. 

Therefore, substituting:

cos(2π/7) - cos(3π/7) - cos(π/7) = -1/2 

Rearranged:

cos(π/7) + cos(3π/7) - cos(2π/7) = 1/2 

Which is exactly the expression we need to prove. 

Therefore, the proof can be structured as follows:

- Use the fact that the sum of the real parts of the 7th roots of unity is zero. 

- Express that sum as 1 + 2*(sum of cos(2πk/7) for k=1 to 3). 

- Then, substitute the cosines using their identities. 

Now, in Lean, how to formalize this? 

First, we need to use the fact that the sum of the 7th roots of unity is zero. 

In Mathlib, the roots of unity can be handled using the Complex module. For example, the sum of all n-th roots of unity is zero. 

But since we are working with real numbers, perhaps we can use the fact that the sum of the real parts is zero. 

Alternatively, we can use the fact that the sum of the real parts of the roots of unity is equal to the real part of the sum of the roots, which is zero. 

So, the real part of the sum of the 7th roots of unity is zero. 

In Lean, we can write this as:

Real.re (sum_{k=0}^6 (Complex.exp (2 * π * I * k / 7))) = 0 

But I need to check if Mathlib has the necessary functions. 

Alternatively, since the sum of the roots of unity is zero, then the real part is zero. 

But how to express that in Lean? 

Alternatively, since the sum of the roots of unity is zero, then the real part of that sum is zero. 

So, in Lean, we can use the fact that sum_{k=0}^6 (Complex.exp (2 * π * I * k / 7)) = 0. 

Then, taking the real part of both sides, we get that the sum of the real parts is zero. 

So, in code:

sum_{k=0}^6 (Real.re (Complex.exp (2 * π * I * k / 7))) = 0 

But how to express this in Lean? 

Alternatively, using the fact that the sum of the real parts is equal to the real part of the sum. 

So, Real.re (sum_{k=0}^6 (Complex.exp (2 * π * I * k / 7))) = 0 

But I need to make sure that the Complex module is properly imported. 

The user's code has imported Mathlib, which includes the Complex module. 

But perhaps in Mathlib, there are functions for roots of unity. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the sum of the real parts of the roots of unity is zero. 

But for the purposes of this proof, maybe we can use the following steps:

1. Use the fact that the sum of the 7th roots of unity is zero. 

2. Take the real part of both sides, which gives the sum of the real parts of the roots is zero. 

3. The real part of the sum is 1 + 2*(cos(2π/7) + cos(4π/7) + cos(6π/7)) = 0. 

4. Then, substitute cos(6π/7) = -cos(π/7), cos(4π/7) = -cos(3π/7), and cos(2π/7) remains. 

5. Then, the equation becomes 1 + 2*(cos(2π/7) - cos(3π/7) - cos(π/7)) = 0. 

6. Rearranged, this gives cos(π/7) + cos(3π/7) - cos(2π/7) = 1/2. 

Therefore, the desired expression is equal to 1/2. 

So, in Lean code, I need to formalize these steps. 

But how to express the sum of the real parts of the roots of unity? 

In Lean, the Complex module is in Mathlib. So, perhaps I can use the Complex.exp function. 

But maybe there's a more straightforward way. 

Alternatively, since the sum of the roots of unity is zero, then the real part is zero. 

So, in code:

have h : Real.re (sum_{k=0}^6 (Complex.exp (2 * π * I * k / 7))) = 0, 

But how to write this? 

Alternatively, since the sum of the roots of unity is zero, then the real part is zero. 

But how to get that in Lean? 

Alternatively, use the fact that the sum of the 7th roots of unity is zero. 

In Mathlib, there's a theorem that the sum of the n-th roots of unity is zero. 

For example, in Mathlib, there's a function called roots_of_unity, but I need to check. 

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that for any n ≥ 1, the sum of the n-th roots of unity is zero. 

But in Lean, this can be proven. 

Alternatively, since the user's code has imported Mathlib, perhaps there's a way to use the fact that the sum is zero. 

Alternatively, for the purposes of this proof, maybe we can directly use the fact that the sum is zero. 

But in any case, the steps are:

- The sum of the real parts of the 7th roots of unity is zero. 

- This sum is 1 + 2*(cos(2π/7) + cos(4π/7) + cos(6π/7)) = 0. 

- Then, substituting the values of the cosines. 

So, in code:

We can use the fact that the sum of the real parts is zero. 

Then, expand that sum.

But this seems too tedious. There's a better way. 

Alternatively, in Lean, we can use the fact that the sum of the real parts is zero. 

So, the sum is 1 + 2*(cos(2π/7) + cos(4π/7) + cos(6π/7)) = 0. 

Then, since cos(6π/7) = -cos(π/7), cos(4π/7) = -cos(3π/7), and cos(2π/7) remains. 

So substituting:

1 + 2*(cos(2π/7) - cos(3π/7) - cos(π/7)) = 0 

Then, rearranged:

cos(π/7) + cos(3π/7) - cos(2π/7) = 1/2 

Which is the desired result. 

Therefore, the proof can be written as:

theorem imo_1963_p5 : Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) = 1 / 2 := by

  exact h5

But I need to fill in the missing parts. 

The key steps are:

- The sum of the real parts of the 7th roots of unity is zero. 

- Which gives 1 + 2*(cos(2π/7) + cos(4π/7) + cos(6π/7)) = 0. 

- Then, using the identities cos(6π/7) = -cos(π/7), cos(4π/7) = -cos(3π/7), and cos(2π/7) remains. 

- Substituting these into the equation gives 1 + 2*(cos(2π/7) - cos(3π/7) - cos(π/7)) = 0. 

- Rearranging this equation gives the desired result. 

So, in Lean, the code would be:

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. 

Alternatively, since we know that the sum of the real parts is zero, we can directly use that. 

In Lean, the sum of the real parts of the 7th roots of unity is zero. 

So, the sum is 1 + 2*(cos(2π/7) + cos(4π/7) + cos(6π/7)) = 0. 

Therefore, we can write:

1 + 2 * (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)) = 0 

Then, using the identities for cos(4π/7) and cos(6π/7), we substitute:

cos(4π/7) = -cos(3π/7), and cos(6π/7) = -cos(π/7). 

So:

1 + 2*(cos(2π/7) - cos(3π/7) - cos(π/7)) = 0 

Rearranging:

cos(π/7) + cos(3π/7) - cos(2π/7) = 1/2 

Which is the desired expression. 

Therefore, the proof can be written as:

theorem imo_1963_p5 : Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) = 1 / 2 := by
  have h : 1 + 2 * (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)) = 0 := by
    sorry
  have h1 : Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7) = -Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) := by
    sorry
  have h2 : Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7) = -Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) := by
    sorry
  have h3 : 1 + 2 * (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (Real.pi / 7)) = 0 := by
    sorry
  have h4 : Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) = 1 / 2 := by
    sorry
  exact h4

But again, I need to fill in the missing parts. 

In Lean, to prove that cos(4π/7) = -cos(3π/7), we can use the identity cos(π - x) = -cos(x). 

Since 4π/7 = π - 3π/7, so cos(4π/7) = -cos(3π/7). Similarly for 6π/7. 

So, in code:

have h1 : Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7) = -Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) := by
  rw [Real.cos_pi_sub, Real.cos]
  -- cos(π - x) = -cos x, so cos(4π/7) = cos(π - 3π/7) = -cos(3π/7)
  exact (Real.cos_pi_sub (3 * Real.pi / 7)).symm

Similarly for the other identity. 

But I need to check if Mathlib has the function Real.cos_pi_sub. 

Alternatively, use the identity cos(π - x) = -cos x. 

In Lean, this can be proven as:

lemma cos_pi_sub (x : Real) : Real.cos (Real.pi - x) = -Real.cos x := by
  sorry

But assuming that this is available or can be proven. 

Similarly for the other terms. 

So, putting this together, the proof would be:

theorem imo_1963_p5 : Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) = 1 / 2 := by
  have h : 1 + 2 * (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)) = 0 := by

    sorry

    exact (Real.cos_pi_sub (3 * Real.pi / 7)).symm
  have h2 : Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7) = -Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) := by

    exact h

    have h5 : 1 + 2 * (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (Real.pi / 7)) = 0 := h3
    have h6 : 1 = 2 * (Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7)) := by
      -- From h5: 1 + 2*(...) = 0 → 2*(...) = -1 → ... = -1/2
      -- But we need to get the desired expression. Let me think.
      -- Let me rearrange h5: 1 = -2*(Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (Real.pi / 7))
      -- Which is 1 = 2*(Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7))
      rw [h5]
      exact (by
        rw [h5]
        rw [mul_neg_one]
        rw [mul_eq_neg]
        exact (by
          have h7 : 2 * (Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7)) = 1
          exact h7))
  exact h4

But this is very abstract. Maybe there's a simpler way. 

Alternatively, since we know that the sum of the real parts is zero, we can directly substitute the identities and solve for the desired expression. 

In code:

theorem imo_1963_p5 : Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) = 1 / 2 := by
  have h : 1 + 2 * (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)) = 0 := by
    -- This is derived from the sum of real parts of 7th roots of unity being zero
    sorry
  have h1 : Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7) = -Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) := by
    rw [Real.cos_pi_sub, Real.cos]
    exact (Real.cos_pi_sub (3 * Real.pi / 7)).symm
  have h2 : Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7) = -Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) := by
    rw [Real.cos_pi_sub, Real.cos]
    exact (Real.cos_pi_sub (Real.pi / 7)).symm
  have h3 : 1 + 2 * (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (Real.pi / 7)) = 0 := by
    rw [h1, h2] at h
    exact h
  have h4 : Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) = 1 / 2 := by
    have h5 : 1 + 2 * (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (Real.pi / 7)) = 0 := h3
    have h6 : 1 = 2 * (Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7)) := by
      have h7 : 2 * (Real.cos (Real.pi / 7) + Real.cos (3 * Real.pi / 7) - Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7)) = 1
      exact h7
    exact h6

But I'm not sure about the exact steps here.
