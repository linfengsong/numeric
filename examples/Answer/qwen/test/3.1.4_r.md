Okay, so I need to show that if p is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, then p squared plus 2 is composite. Hmm, let me think. First, let me recall what a composite number is. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. So, if I can show that p² + 2 can be divided by some number other than 1 and itself, then it's composite. 

Alright, so p is a prime number ≥5. Let me start by testing some examples to see if I can find a pattern or maybe a way to factor it. Let me take p=5 first. Then p² + 2 is 25 + 2 = 27. 27 is 3³, so it's composite. Okay, that works. How about p=7? 7² is 49, plus 2 is 51. 51 is 3×17, so composite. p=11? 121 + 2 = 123, which is 3×41. Also composite. p=13? 169 + 2 = 171, which is 9×19. Composite again. Hmm, seems like all these examples are composite. But how do I prove it for all primes ≥5?

Maybe I can try to factor p² + 2. But factoring quadratic expressions... Well, p² + 2 is a sum of squares? Wait, no, p² + 2 isn't a sum of squares. Wait, p² + 2 is p² + (√2)², but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can write it in some other way. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. If I can show that p² + 2 is divisible by some small prime, like 3, 5, 7, etc., then that would show it's composite. Let me check divisibility by 3 first. Let me recall that primes greater than 3 are congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3. Since p is a prime ≥5, it can't be 3. So p ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3.

If p ≡ 1 mod 3, then p² ≡ 1² = 1 mod 3. Then p² + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. So 3 divides p² + 2. Similarly, if p ≡ 2 mod 3, then p² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Then p² + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. So in either case, p² + 2 is divisible by 3. Therefore, since p² + 2 is divisible by 3, and since p² + 2 is greater than 3 (since p ≥5, p² + 2 ≥ 25 + 2 = 27 > 3), then p² + 2 is composite. Because if a number is divisible by 3 and greater than 3, it's composite. 

Wait, so that seems to work. So regardless of whether p is 1 or 2 mod 3, p² + 2 is divisible by 3. Therefore, p² + 2 is composite. So that's the proof? Let me check again. 

Take p=5: 5² + 2 = 27, which is 3×9. Correct. p=7: 49 + 2 = 51 = 3×17. Correct. p=11: 121 + 2 = 123 = 3×41. Correct. So seems like 3 divides it. So that's the key. 

But wait, why does p² + 2 always divisible by 3? Let me think again. Since p is a prime ≥5, so p is not divisible by 3. Therefore, p mod 3 is either 1 or 2. Then p² mod 3 is 1 in either case. Therefore, p² + 2 mod 3 is 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, yes, 3 divides p² + 2. Therefore, since p² + 2 is divisible by 3 and greater than 3, it's composite. 

Therefore, this should be the proof. But wait, let me check if there's a case where p² + 2 is equal to 3. If p² + 2 = 3, then p² = 1, so p=1 or -1, but p is a prime ≥5, so that's impossible. Therefore, p² + 2 is always greater than 3, hence composite. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that p² + 2 is composite. 

But wait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using modulo 5? Let me check. For example, primes greater than 5 are congruent to 1, 2, 3, or 4 mod 5. Let me check p² + 2 mod 5. If p is 1 mod 5, then p² is 1, so p² + 2 is 3 mod 5. If p is 2 mod 5, p² is 4, so p² + 2 is 6 ≡ 1 mod 5. If p is 3 mod 5, p² is 9 ≡ 4 mod 5, so p² + 2 is 6 ≡ 1 mod 5. If p is 4 mod 5, p² is 16 ≡ 1 mod 5, so p² + 2 is 3 mod 5. So in this case, p² + 2 is either 1 or 3 mod 5. So not necessarily divisible by 5. Therefore, maybe 5 is not a divisor. So maybe 3 is the key here.

Alternatively, maybe there's another modulus. But since we already have that 3 divides p² + 2, that's sufficient. Therefore, the key is that p² + 2 is divisible by 3. Therefore, the proof is done. 

Alternatively, maybe I can write p² + 2 as 3k, where k is some integer. Since p² + 2 is divisible by 3, then k = (p² + 2)/3. Since p ≥5, then p² is at least 25, so p² + 2 is at least 27, so k is at least 9. Therefore, since k is an integer greater than or equal to 9, then 3k is composite. Therefore, p² + 2 is composite. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as p² + 2 = (p - something)(p + something). But since p² + 2 is not a difference of squares, maybe not. Wait, p² + 2 can be written as p² + (√2)^2, but that's not helpful for integer factors. So factoring is not straightforward. But using modular arithmetic, we can show that 3 divides it. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that p² + 2 is composite. Therefore, the answer is that p² + 2 is composite because it is divisible by 3, which is a prime number less than p² + 2. 

But let me check if there's a possibility that p² + 2 is 3 itself. But p is at least 5, so p² is at least 25, so p² + 2 is at least 27, which is way bigger than 3. So 3 is a proper divisor. Hence, composite. 

Therefore, I think that's the proof. So the key idea is that for primes ≥5, they are not divisible by 3, so their square is 1 mod 3, so adding 2 gives 0 mod 3. Therefore, 3 divides p² + 2, and since p² + 2 is greater than 3, it is composite.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{p^2 + 2 \text{ is composite}}

To show that for any prime number $ p \geq 5 $, the expression $ p^2 + 2 $ is **composite**, we proceed as follows:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

We are given that $ p $ is a **prime number** and $ p \geq 5 $. We are to show that the number $ p^2 + 2 $ is **composite**, meaning it has a **proper divisor other than 1 and itself**.

---

### Step 2: Use Modular Arithmetic to Analyze $ p^2 + 2 $

Since $ p \geq 5 $, $ p $ is not divisible by 3. Therefore, $ p \mod 3 $ can only be **1 or 2** (since 3 is the only prime that divides 3, and $ p $ is not divisible by 3).

- If $ p \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $, then $ p^2 \equiv 1^2 = 1 \pmod{3} $, and hence:
  $$
  p^2 + 2 \equiv 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}
  $$
- If $ p \equiv 2 \pmod{3} $, then $ p^2 \equiv 2^2 = 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $, and again:
  $$
  p^2 + 2 \equiv 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}
  $$

In both cases, $ p^2 + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $, which means that **3 divides $ p^2 + 2 $**.

---

### Step 3: Conclude that $ p^2 + 2 $ is Composite

We now know that:
- $ p^2 + 2 $ is divisible by 3,
- $ p \geq 5 $, so $ p^2 \geq 25 $, and thus $ p^2 + 2 \geq 27 $,
- Therefore, $ p^2 + 2 > 3 $, and since it is divisible by 3, it has a proper divisor (3) other than 1 and itself.

Thus, $ p^2 + 2 $ is **composite**.
