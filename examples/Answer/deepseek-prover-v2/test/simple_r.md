To find the integral of \( x^2 \) from 0 to 2, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Find the Antiderivative
The antiderivative (indefinite integral) of \( x^2 \) is:
\[
\int x^2 \, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C
\]
where \( C \) is the constant of integration.

### Step 2: Evaluate the Definite Integral
Now, we evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit (2) and subtract its value at the lower limit (0):
\[
\int_{0}^{2} x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{2} = \frac{2^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} = \frac{8}{3} - 0 = \frac{8}{3}
\]

### Final Answer
The value of the integral is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{8}{3}}
\]
