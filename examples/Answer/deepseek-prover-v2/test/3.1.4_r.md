### Understanding the Problem

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It states:

**"If p ≥ 5 is a prime number, show that p² + 2 is composite."**

Breaking it down:
1. **p ≥ 5**: We're considering prime numbers starting from 5 and above.
2. **Prime number**: A natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
3. **p² + 2**: We need to consider the expression p squared plus two.
4. **Composite**: A natural number that has positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Initial Thoughts

I need to show that for any prime p ≥ 5, p² + 2 is not prime but composite. To approach this, I think about properties of primes and how they behave when squared and added to 2.

### Exploring Examples

Sometimes, starting with examples helps to see a pattern.

1. **First Example: p = 5**
   - p² + 2 = 25 + 2 = 27
   - 27 is divisible by 3 and 9 (3 × 9 = 27). So, 27 is composite.

2. **Second Example: p = 7**
   - p² + 2 = 49 + 2 = 51
   - 51 is divisible by 3 and 17 (3 × 17 = 51). Composite.

3. **Third Example: p = 11**
   - p² + 2 = 121 + 2 = 123
   - 123 is divisible by 3 and 41 (3 × 41 = 123). Composite.

4. **Fourth Example: p = 13**
   - p² + 2 = 169 + 2 = 171
   - 171 is divisible by 3 and 57 (3 × 57 = 171). Composite.

From these examples, it seems that p² + 2 is divisible by 3 in all cases.

### Hypothesis Formation

Based on the examples, I hypothesize that for any prime p ≥ 5, p² + 2 is divisible by 3.

### Testing the Hypothesis

To verify, I need a more general approach rather than relying on examples.

#### Understanding Primes ≥5

All primes greater than or equal to 5 can be expressed in the form of 6k ± 1, where k is a positive integer. This is because:
- Any integer can be expressed as 6k, 6k ± 1, 6k ± 2, or 6k ± 3.
- Numbers of the form 6k, 6k ± 2, and 6k ± 3 are divisible by 2 or 3, so they're not primes (except for the primes 2 and 3 themselves).

Since p ≥ 5, p can be written as p = 6k ± 1.

#### Case 1: p = 6k + 1

Let's compute p² + 2:
p² + 2 = (6k + 1)² + 2 = 36k² + 12k + 1 + 2 = 36k² + 12k + 3 = 3(12k² + 4k + 1)

This expression is clearly divisible by 3.

#### Case 2: p = 6k - 1

Similarly, compute p² + 2:
p² + 2 = (6k - 1)² + 2 = 36k² - 12k + 1 + 2 = 36k² - 12k + 3 = 3(12k² - 4k + 1)

Again, this is divisible by 3.

### Verification

From both cases, p² + 2 is divisible by 3. But is p² + 2 necessarily composite?

Well, p² + 2 = 3 × (some integer). For p ≥ 5:
- The term (12k² ± 4k + 1) is always greater than 1.
  - For k=1 (p=5 or p=7): 
    - For p=5 (k=1, p=6k-1): 12(1)² - 4(1) + 1 = 9 > 1
    - For p=7 (k=1, p=6k+1): 12(1)² + 4(1) + 1 = 17 > 1
  - For larger k, the term only increases.

Thus, p² + 2 is a product of 3 and another integer greater than 1, making it composite.

### Edge Cases

What about p=3? The problem specifies p ≥ 5, but just for completeness:
- p² + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11, which is prime.

But since p must be ≥5, p=3 is excluded.

### Conclusion

For any prime p ≥ 5, p can be expressed as 6k ± 1. Substituting into p² + 2 gives an expression that is always divisible by 3 and results in a product of two integers greater than 1. Therefore, p² + 2 is composite.

### Final Answer

After careful consideration, we can conclude that for any prime number \( p \geq 5 \), the expression \( p^2 + 2 \) is indeed composite. This is because:

1. Any prime \( p \geq 5 \) can be written in the form \( p = 6k \pm 1 \) for some integer \( k \geq 1 \).
2. Substituting into \( p^2 + 2 \):
   - If \( p = 6k + 1 \), then \( p^2 + 2 = 3(12k^2 + 4k + 1) \).
   - If \( p = 6k - 1 \), then \( p^2 + 2 = 3(12k^2 - 4k + 1) \).
3. In both cases, \( p^2 + 2 \) is divisible by 3 and the other factor is greater than 1, ensuring that \( p^2 + 2 \) is composite.

\boxed{For any prime number \( p \geq 5 \), \( p^2 + 2 \) is divisible by 3 and greater than 3, thus it is a composite number.}
