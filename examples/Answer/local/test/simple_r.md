 The integral of $x^2$ from 0 to 2 is given by the antiderivative of $x^2$, which is $\frac{1}{3}x^3$, evaluated at the endpoints 0 and 2.

So, the integral is $\frac{1}{3}(2)^3 - \frac{1}{3}(0)^3 = \frac{1}{3}(8) - \frac{1}{3}(0) = \frac{8}{3}$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{$\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}$}$.
The answer is $\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}$.
