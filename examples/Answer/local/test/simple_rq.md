Okay, so I need to find the integral of x squared from 0 to 2. Hmm, let me remember how to do this. Integrals, right? So, integrating a function gives me the area under the curve between two points. In this case, from 0 to 2. Alright, the function is x squared. 

First, I think I need to recall the basic rules of integration. I remember that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration. But since this is a definite integral from 0 to 2, I don't need the constant, right? I just need to evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit and subtract its value at the lower limit. 

So let me write that down. The integral of x² dx from 0 to 2 is equal to [ (x³)/3 ] evaluated from 0 to 2. That means I plug in 2 into the antiderivative and then subtract the value when x is 0. 

Let me check if I did that right. The antiderivative of x² is indeed (x³)/3 because if I take the derivative of (x³)/3, I get (3x²)/3 which simplifies to x². Yep, that matches the original function. Good, so that part is correct. 

Now, plugging in the upper limit, which is 2. So (2)³ divided by 3. 2 cubed is 8, so that would be 8/3. Then, subtracting the value at the lower limit, which is 0. So plugging in 0 into (x³)/3 gives me (0)³ / 3, which is 0. 

Therefore, the integral should be 8/3 - 0, which is just 8/3. Wait, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should verify. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the integral as the area under the curve of x² from 0 to 2. I know that the integral represents the area, so maybe I can approximate it with Riemann sums? Although that might be more complicated, but just to check. 

Let me try with a simple Riemann sum. Let's divide the interval [0, 2] into two subintervals. So each subinterval would have a width of 1. The right endpoints would be 1 and 2. The height at x=1 is 1² = 1, and at x=2 is 4. So the Riemann sum would be 1*(1) + 1*(4) = 1 + 4 = 5. But the actual integral is 8/3 which is approximately 2.666..., so 5 is way bigger. That's because using only two rectangles with right endpoints overestimates the area. 

If I use more rectangles, say four subintervals, each of width 0.5. The right endpoints are 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0. The heights are (0.5)^2 = 0.25, (1.0)^2 = 1, (1.5)^2 = 2.25, (2.0)^2 = 4. The Riemann sum would be 0.5*(0.25 + 1 + 2.25 + 4) = 0.5*(7.5) = 3.75. That's closer to 8/3 (which is approximately 2.666...). Wait, 3.75 is still larger. Hmm. Maybe I need to use left endpoints? 

If I use left endpoints for the same four subintervals: left endpoints are 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5. The heights are 0, 0.25, 1, 2.25. The Riemann sum would be 0.5*(0 + 0.25 + 1 + 2.25) = 0.5*(3.5) = 1.75. Which is less than 8/3. So the actual value is between 1.75 and 3.75. 

But since the function x² is increasing, the left Riemann sum underestimates and the right Riemann sum overestimates. So the exact value should be between 1.75 and 3.75. 8/3 is approximately 2.666..., which is between those two. So that seems plausible. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the trapezoidal rule? For the four subintervals, the trapezoidal rule would average the left and right sums. So (left + right)/2 = (1.75 + 3.75)/2 = 5.5/2 = 2.75. Which is closer to 8/3 (which is about 2.666...). The trapezoidal rule gives 2.75, which is a bit higher. 

But since I know the exact answer is 8/3, which is approximately 2.666..., and the trapezoidal estimate with four intervals is 2.75, which is close. So maybe my original calculation is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I can check using another method. For example, using geometry. Wait, the integral of x² from 0 to 2 is the volume under the curve, but I don't know if that helps. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution? Wait, but substitution is usually for more complicated integrals. For x squared, the antiderivative is straightforward. 

Wait, let me think again. The integral of x squared is (x³)/3. So evaluating from 0 to 2: (2³)/3 - (0³)/3 = 8/3 - 0 = 8/3. That seems straightforward. 

But maybe I can check with another antiderivative. Suppose I didn't remember the power rule. Let me think. If I have the integral of x² dx, maybe I can use the definition of the integral as the limit of Riemann sums. But that would be tedious. 

Alternatively, maybe I can differentiate my result to see if I get back the original function. If I take d/dx [ (x³)/3 ] = (3x²)/3 = x². Yep, that's the original function. So that checks out. 

Therefore, I think my answer is correct. The integral of x² from 0 to 2 is 8/3. 

Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can use another method. For example, integration by parts? Although that seems unnecessary here, but let me try. 

Integration by parts formula is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. Let me choose u and dv. Let me set u = x, dv = x dx. Then du = dx, and v = (x²)/2. Then ∫x² dx = uv - ∫v du = x*(x²)/2 - ∫(x²)/2 dx. Wait, that gives ∫x² dx = (x³)/2 - (1/2)∫x² dx. 

Let me write that equation: Let I = ∫x² dx. Then according to integration by parts, I = (x³)/2 - (1/2)I. Then, bringing the (1/2)I to the left side: I + (1/2)I = (x³)/2. So (3/2)I = (x³)/2. Therefore, I = (x³)/2 * 2/3 = x³/3. Which matches the standard result. 

Therefore, even using integration by parts, I get the same antiderivative. So that confirms it again. 

Therefore, evaluating from 0 to 2 gives 8/3 - 0 = 8/3. 

Another way: maybe using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Since we know that the antiderivative is x³/3, then the definite integral is F(2) - F(0) = 8/3 - 0 = 8/3. 

So all methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I think I can be confident that the integral of x squared from 0 to 2 is 8/3. 

Just to recap, steps were: 

1. Find the antiderivative of x², which is x³/3. 

2. Evaluate it at upper limit 2: 2³/3 = 8/3. 

3. Evaluate it at lower limit 0: 0³/3 = 0. 

4. Subtract: 8/3 - 0 = 8/3. 

All steps make sense and have been verified through different methods. 

I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So the answer should be 8/3.

**Final Answer**
The integral of $x^2$ from 0 to 2 is \boxed{\dfrac{8}{3}}.

To evaluate the definite integral of $ x^2 $ from 0 to 2, we proceed by applying the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**. This theorem allows us to compute definite integrals by first finding an antiderivative of the integrand and then evaluating it at the bounds of integration.

### Step 1: Find the Antiderivative

We are integrating the function $ f(x) = x^2 $. The general rule for integrating powers of $ x $ is:

$$
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C, \quad \text{for } n \neq -1
$$

Applying this to $ x^2 $, we get:

$$
\int x^2 \, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C
$$

### Step 2: Evaluate the Definite Integral

We now compute the definite integral from 0 to 2 using the antiderivative:

$$
\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_0^2
$$

Evaluate at the upper limit $ x = 2 $:

$$
\frac{2^3}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
$$

Evaluate at the lower limit $ x = 0 $:

$$
\frac{0^3}{3} = 0
$$

Subtract the two:

$$
\frac{8}{3} - 0 = \frac{8}{3}
$$

\boxed{\dfrac{8}{3}}
