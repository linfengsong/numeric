 To show that $p^2 + 2$ is composite, we need to show that it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

Let's consider the expression $p^2 + 2$. 

We know that $p$ is a prime number, and since $p \geq 5$, $p$ must be an odd number. 

Now, let's consider the expression $p^2 + 2$. Since $p$ is odd, $p^2$ is also odd. Therefore, $p^2 + 2$ is an odd number.

An odd number can be written in the form $2k + 1$, where $k$ is an integer. 

So, we can write $p^2 + 2$ as $2k + 1$. 

Now, let's factorize $2k + 1$. We can rewrite it as $2k + 1 = (k + 1)(k + 1) - k$.

Since $k$ is an integer, both $k + 1$ and $k$ are integers. 

Therefore, $p^2 + 2 = (k + 1)(k + 1) - k$ has factors other than 1 and itself, which means $p^2 + 2$ is composite.
