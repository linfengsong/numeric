Okay, so I need to prove these four properties about triangular numbers. Let me start by recalling what triangular numbers are. The problem says they are numbers that can be arranged in an equilateral triangle, like 1, 3, 6, 10, etc. Each triangular number is the sum of the first n natural numbers. So, for example, the first triangular number is 1, the second is 1+2=3, the third is 1+2+3=6, and so on. 

Starting with part (a): "A number is triangular if and only if it is of the form n(n + 1)/2 for some n ≤ 1." Wait, hold on, n ≤ 1? That seems odd. Because if n is 1, then the formula gives 1(1+1)/2 = 1, which is the first triangular number. But the problem says "for some n ≤ 1". That seems like maybe a typo? Maybe it's supposed to be n ≥ 1? Because otherwise, if n is less than or equal to 1, the only possible n is 1, which would make the triangular numbers just 1. But the example given includes 3, 6, 10, etc. So maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the original problem again.

Wait, the original problem says: "(a) A number is triangular if and only if it is of the form n(n + 1)/2 for some n ≤ 1." Hmm. That seems incorrect. Maybe it's supposed to be n ≥ 1? Because otherwise, the statement is trivial. For example, if n is 1, then the formula gives 1, and if n is 0, then it's 0(0+1)/2 = 0, which is also a triangular number? Wait, but the problem says "numbers" starting from 1. Maybe the original problem has a typo, and it's supposed to be n ≥ 1? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the original problem is in another language and there was a translation error? The user wrote "n ≤ 1", but that seems incorrect. Maybe it's supposed to be "n ≥ 1"? Because otherwise, the statement is not correct. For example, 3 is triangular, but 3 = 2(2+1)/2 = 3, so n=2. So if the statement was "for some n ≥ 1", then it would make sense. So maybe the original problem had a typo. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct as stated, and I need to figure it out.

Wait, maybe the problem is in the original statement. Let me check again. The problem says: "(a) A number is triangular if and only if it is of the form n(n + 1)/2 for some n ≤ 1." That seems to imply that n can be any number less than or equal to 1, but n(n+1)/2 for n ≤ 1 would only give numbers when n is 1 or less. For n=1, we get 1(2)/2=1. For n=0, we get 0(1)/2=0. For n negative, like n=-1, we get (-1)(0)/2=0. So the only triangular numbers would be 0 and 1? But that contradicts the given examples. Therefore, I think there must be a typo in the problem statement. It's likely supposed to be "for some n ≥ 1". Let me check if that makes sense. If so, then part (a) is essentially defining triangular numbers as the numbers given by the formula n(n+1)/2 for positive integers n. 

But since the problem says "n ≤ 1", maybe the original problem is correct, and I need to figure out why. Wait, maybe the problem is referring to n being a positive integer? But even so, n ≤ 1 would only include n=1. So that seems wrong. Maybe the problem meant "n is a positive integer"? Maybe the user made a mistake in writing the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the statement is supposed to be "n ≥ 1", but the user mistyped it as "n ≤ 1". 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a source where the original statement is different. For example, maybe the original problem says "n is a positive integer" and the user mistyped it. Given that the rest of the problem seems to be about triangular numbers, and part (a) is supposed to be the definition, I think it's safe to assume that it's a typo and that the correct statement is "for some n ≥ 1". 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, but the wording is different. Let me think. If the problem says "for some n ≤ 1", then the only triangular numbers are 0 and 1. But the problem says the examples start with 1, 3, 6, 10, etc. So maybe the problem is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the statement is supposed to be "for some n ≥ 1", and the user made a mistake in writing "n ≤ 1". Since the user is asking for help, maybe I should proceed assuming that it's a typo and that part (a) is supposed to say "for some n ≥ 1". Let me proceed with that assumption. 

So, part (a) is essentially the definition of triangular numbers. The problem says that the ancient Greeks called a number triangular if it is the sum of consecutive integers beginning with 1. So, that is exactly the formula n(n+1)/2. Therefore, the statement is that a number is triangular if and only if it can be written as n(n+1)/2 for some positive integer n. So, if that's the case, then part (a) is just restating the definition. But maybe the problem is expecting a proof that the triangular numbers are exactly those numbers of that form. 

Wait, the problem says "Prove the following facts concerning triangular numbers", so part (a) is supposed to be a proof that a number is triangular if and only if it is of the form n(n + 1)/2 for some n ≤ 1. Wait, but if n is 1, then it's 1(2)/2=1. If n is 0, then 0(1)/2=0, which is also a triangular number. But maybe the problem is considering only positive integers? Maybe the original problem is in another language where "n ≤ 1" was a mistranslation. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the statement is supposed to be for n ≥ 1. Let me check the original problem again. The user wrote:

"(a) A number is triangular if and only if it is of the form n(n + 1)/2 for some n ≤ 1."

Wait, that seems to be a mistake. Let me check the original problem's source. Since I don't have access to that, but given that the examples include numbers like 3, 6, 10, which correspond to n=2, 3, 4, etc., I think the correct statement should be "for some n ≥ 1". Therefore, I think there's a typo in the problem statement, and the correct version is "for some n ≥ 1". 

Assuming that, then part (a) is straightforward. The definition of triangular numbers is that they are numbers that can be expressed as the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n(n+1)/2. Therefore, the statement is just the definition. However, maybe the problem is expecting a proof that the converse is also true, i.e., that any number of the form n(n+1)/2 is triangular, and any triangular number can be written in that form. 

But since triangular numbers are defined as the sum of consecutive integers starting from 1, then the formula n(n+1)/2 is exactly that sum. Therefore, the "if and only if" statement is trivial. However, maybe the problem is expecting a more rigorous proof? For example, proving that the sum 1 + 2 + ... + n equals n(n+1)/2, which is a standard result. 

Wait, but part (a) is supposed to be a proof that a number is triangular iff it is of that form. So, if we take the definition as the sum of consecutive integers starting from 1, then the formula is the same as the definition. Therefore, the "if and only if" is just restating the definition. However, maybe the problem is in the context where triangular numbers are defined as numbers that can be arranged in a triangle, and the user needs to prove that such numbers are exactly those of the form n(n+1)/2. 

Therefore, maybe the proof is as follows: 

First, show that the sum 1 + 2 + ... + n is equal to n(n+1)/2. This is a well-known formula, which can be proven by induction or by pairing terms. 

Then, show that any triangular number must be of that form. Wait, but if we define triangular numbers as those that can be arranged in a triangle, which is equivalent to being the sum of the first n natural numbers, then the formula is the definition. Therefore, maybe the problem is just stating the definition. However, given that the problem is from ancient Greeks, maybe the problem is expecting a more historical proof? 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to prove that if a number is triangular, then it must be of that form, and vice versa. 

But given that the problem says "prove the following facts", maybe part (a) is just stating the definition, but perhaps the user is supposed to prove that the triangular numbers are exactly those numbers of the form n(n+1)/2. 

So, for example, suppose that T_n =
