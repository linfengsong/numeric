 To prove that no integer in the sequence is a perfect square, we can use a proof by contradiction. We will assume that there exists an integer in the sequence that is a perfect square and then show that this leads to a contradiction.

Let's consider the $n$-th term in the sequence, which is given by $111...1$ (with $n$ ones). We can express this number in base 10 as follows:

$$111...1 = 1 \cdot 10^{n-1} + 1 \cdot 10^{n-2} + \cdots + 1 \cdot 10^0 = \frac{10^n - 1}{10 - 1} = \frac{10^n - 1}{9}$$

Now, let's assume that there exists an integer $k$ in the sequence such that $k^2 = 111...1$. Then we have:

$$k^2 = \left(\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\right)^2 = \frac{(10^n - 1)^2}{81}$$

Multiplying both sides by $81$, we get:

$$81k^2 = (10^n - 1)^2$$

Expanding the right side, we have:

$$81k^2 = 10^{2n} - 2 \cdot 10^n + 1$$

Now, let's consider the right side of the equation modulo 10. We have:

$$10^{2n} \equiv 0 \pmod{10}$$
$$2 \cdot 10^n \equiv 0 \pmod{10}$$
$$1 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$$

Adding these congruences together, we get:

$$10^{2n} - 2 \cdot 10^n + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$$

So, we have:

$$81k^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$$

However, this is a contradiction because $81k^2$ is a perfect square, and the only perfect squares that are congruent to 1 modulo 10 are 1 and 9. Since $k^2$ is a perfect square, it must be greater than or equal to 1, so $81k^2$ must be greater than or equal to 81. Therefore, $81k^2$ cannot be congruent to 1 modulo 10.

This contradiction implies that our assumption that there exists an integer $k$ in the sequence such that $k^2 = 111...1$ is false. Therefore, no integer in the sequence $11, 111, 1111, 11111, ...$ is a perfect square.
