 To establish the assertion, we need to show that if a is an odd integer, then 24 divides a(a^2 - 1).

Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that a is an odd integer, which means it can be written in the form 2k + 1, where k is an integer.
2. We also know that the square of an odd integer is of the form 8k + 1, as given in the hint.

Now, let's substitute these forms into the expression a(a^2 - 1):

a(a^2 - 1) = (2k + 1)((2k + 1)^2 - 1)

Expanding the expression, we get:

a(a^2 - 1) = (2k + 1)(4k^2 + 4k + 1 - 1)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

a(a^2 - 1) = (2k + 1)(4k^2 + 4k)

Factoring out a 4 from the second term, we get:

a(a^2 - 1) = (2k + 1)(4k(k + 1))

Now, we need to show that 24 divides this expression. Since 24 = 2^3 * 3, we need to show that 2^3 and 3 divide the expression.

1. 2^3 divides the expression:

We know that one of k or (k + 1) must be even, because consecutive integers are always of different parity (even and odd). Therefore, at least one of k or (k + 1) is divisible by 2. This means that 2^3 = 8 divides the expression.

2. 3 divides the expression:

We know that the product of any three consecutive integers is divisible by 3. In this case, we have k, (k + 1), and (2k + 1) as three consecutive integers. Therefore, 3 divides the expression.

Since 2^3 and 3 divide the expression, their product, 24, also divides the expression.

Therefore, we have established the assertion: If a is an odd integer, then $24 | a(a^2 - 1)$.
