Okay, so I need to solve these two problems. Let me start with part (a). The question is asking me to prove that if d divides n, then 2^d - 1 divides 2^n - 1. Hmm, divisibility here. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with divisibility in exponents, sometimes using modular arithmetic can be helpful. If I can show that 2^n ≡ 1 mod (2^d - 1), then that would imply that 2^d - 1 divides 2^n - 1. Let me check if that's the case.

So, suppose d divides n. Then n can be written as n = k*d for some integer k. So, 2^n - 1 = 2^{k*d} - 1. Now, I need to show that 2^d - 1 divides this expression. 

Wait, there's a formula for factoring expressions like a^m - 1 when m is a multiple of some number. For example, a^{km} - 1 can be factored as (a^m - 1)(a^{m(k-1)} + a^{m(k-2)} + ... + a^m + 1). Is that right? Let me verify with small numbers. Let's take k=2, m=3. Then 2^{6} - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63. And (2^3 -1)(2^3 + 1) = 7 * 9 = 63. Yes, that works. So in general, 2^{kd} - 1 factors into (2^d - 1)(2^{d(k-1)} + 2^{d(k-2)} + ... + 2^d + 1). Therefore, 2^d - 1 divides 2^{kd} - 1, which is 2^n - 1. So that seems to prove part (a). 

But maybe I should think of another way to approach this, just to make sure. Let me try using modular arithmetic. If I consider 2^d ≡ 1 mod (2^d - 1), because 2^d - 1 is congruent to 0 mod (2^d - 1), so 2^d ≡ 1. Then, if I raise both sides to the power of k, I get (2^d)^k ≡ 1^k mod (2^d - 1), which is 2^{dk} ≡ 1 mod (2^d - 1). But 2^{dk} is 2^n since n = dk. Therefore, 2^n ≡ 1 mod (2^d - 1), which implies that 2^n - 1 ≡ 0 mod (2^d - 1). Therefore, 2^d - 1 divides 2^n - 1. 

So both methods lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, part (a) is proven. 

Now moving on to part (b). I need to verify that 2^{35} - 1 is divisible by 31 and 127. Let me first recall that 31 and 127 are both Mersenne primes. 31 is 2^5 - 1, and 127 is 2^7 - 1. So, maybe I can use the result from part (a) here. 

Since 31 is 2^5 - 1, then if 5 divides 35, then 2^5 - 1 divides 2^{35} - 1. Let me check if 5 divides 35. Yes, 35 = 5 * 7. Therefore, by part (a), 31 divides 2^{35} - 1. Similarly, 127 is 2^7 - 1. So if 7 divides 35, then 127 divides 2^{35} - 1. 35 divided by 7 is 5, so yes, 7 divides 35. Therefore, by part (a), 127 divides 2^{35} - 1. Therefore, both 31 and 127 divide 2^{35} - 1. 

But maybe I should verify this with actual calculations to be sure. Let me compute 2^35 - 1 modulo 31 and modulo 127 and check if they are zero. 

Starting with modulo 31. Since 31 is 2^5 - 1, so 2^5 ≡ 1 mod 31. Therefore, 2^5 ≡ 1 mod 31. Then, 2^35 = 2^{5*7} = (2^5)^7 ≡ 1^7 = 1 mod 31. Therefore, 2^35 - 1 ≡ 1 - 1 = 0 mod 31. So that works. 

Similarly, for modulo 127. 127 is 2^7 - 1, so 2^7 ≡ 1 mod 127. Then 2^35 = 2^{7*5} = (2^7)^5 ≡ 1^5 = 1 mod 127. Therefore, 2^35 - 1 ≡ 1 - 1 = 0 mod 127. Therefore, both 31 and 127 divide 2^35 - 1. 

Alternatively, maybe I can compute 2^35 mod 31 and 2^35 mod 127 directly. Let me try that. 

For 2^35 mod 31:

Since 2^5 ≡ 1 mod 31, as above, then 2^5 ≡ 1, so 2^10 = (2^5)^2 ≡ 1^2 = 1, and so on. Therefore, 2^35 = 2^(5*7) = (2^5)^7 ≡ 1^7 = 1 mod 31. Therefore, 2^35 - 1 ≡ 0 mod 31. 

Similarly, for 2^35 mod 127:

Since 2^7 ≡ 1 mod 127, then 2^7 ≡ 1, so 2^14 = (2^7)^2 ≡ 1, 2^21 ≡ 1, 2^28 ≡ 1, and 2^35 = 2^28 * 2^7 ≡ 1 * 1 = 1 mod 127. Therefore, 2^35 - 1 ≡ 0 mod 127. 

So both checks confirm that 31 and 127 divide 2^35 - 1. 

Alternatively, maybe I can compute 2^35 directly and subtract 1, then check divisibility by 31 and 127. However, 2^35 is a huge number. Let me see if I can compute it step by step. 

But maybe that's not necessary since we already have the modular arithmetic approach. However, just to be thorough, let me compute 2^35 mod 31. Let's compute powers of 2 modulo 31:

2^1 = 2 mod 31

2^2 = 4

2^3 = 8

2^4 = 16

2^5 = 32 ≡ 1 mod 31

So 2^5 ≡ 1, so the cycle repeats every 5. Therefore, 2^35 = (2^5)^7 ≡ 1^7 = 1 mod 31. Therefore, 2^35 - 1 ≡ 0 mod 31. 

Similarly for 127:

Compute 2^7 mod 127. 2^7 is 128, which is 128 - 127 = 1 mod 127. Therefore, 2^7 ≡ 1 mod 127. Therefore, 2^35 = 2^(7*5) = (2^7)^5 ≡ 1^5 = 1 mod 127. Therefore, 2^35 - 1 ≡ 0 mod 127. 

Therefore, both 31 and 127 divide 2^35 - 1. 

Alternatively, maybe I can compute 2^35 - 1 divided by 31 and 127 and check if they are integers. However, since 2^35 is 34359738368, so 2^35 - 1 is 34359738367. Let me check if 31 divides that. 

But dividing such a large number by 31 would be tedious manually, but since we already have the modular arithmetic proof, which is more straightforward, perhaps that's sufficient. 

But just for practice, let me check 2^35 mod 31 again. Let me compute 2^5 = 32, which is 1 mod 31. Then 2^10 = (2^5)^2 = 1^2 = 1 mod 31. Similarly, 2^15 = 2^10 * 2^5 ≡ 1 * 1 = 1 mod 31. Continuing, 2^20 ≡ 1, 2^25 ≡ 1, 2^30 ≡ 1, then 2^35 = 2^30 * 2^5 ≡ 1 * 1 = 1 mod 31. Yep, same result. 

Similarly for 127, 2^7 = 128 ≡ 1 mod 127, so 2^7k ≡ 1 mod 127. 35 is 5*7, so 2^35 ≡ 1 mod 127. 

Therefore, both 31 and 127 divide 2^35 - 1. 

Alternatively, maybe I can factor 2^35 - 1. Since 35 factors into 5 and 7, and using the formula for factoring differences of powers. 

We know that 2^35 - 1 = (2^5)^7 - 1 = (2^5 - 1)(2^{5*6} + 2^{5*5} + ... + 2^5 + 1). Which is 31 multiplied by some integer. Similarly, 2^35 - 1 can also be written as (2^7)^5 - 1 = (2^7 - 1)(2^{7*4} + 2^{7*3} + ... + 2^7 + 1) = 127 multiplied by some integer. Therefore, 31 and 127 are factors of 2^35 - 1. 

Therefore, both parts are verified. 

So, in summary, for part (a), using the fact that if d divides n, then 2^n - 1 can be written as (2^d - 1) times another integer, hence 2^d - 1 divides 2^n - 1. For part (b), since 35 is a multiple of both 5 and 7, which are the exponents in 31 and 127, we can apply the result from part (a) to show that both 31 and 127 divide 2^35 - 1. 

I think that covers both parts. Let me check if there's any possible mistake here. 

For part (a), the key idea is that when you have exponents, if you have a divisor relationship, you can factor the expression. The modular arithmetic approach also works, since 2^d ≡ 1 mod (2^d - 1), so raising to the k-th power gives 2^{dk} ≡ 1 mod (2^d - 1). Therefore, 2^n - 1 is congruent to 0 mod (2^d - 1). 

For part (b), verifying with specific numbers, since 35 is a multiple of 5 and 7, and since 31 is 2^5 - 1 and 127 is 2^7 - 1, we can directly apply the result from part (a). 

Another thing to check is that 31 and 127 are indeed primes. 31 is a prime number, and 127 is also a prime number. Therefore, they are Mersenne primes. But even if they weren't, the result from part (a) would still hold. 

So, I think my reasoning is solid here. 

**Final Answer**

(a) \boxed{2^d - 1 \mid 2^n - 1}

(b) \boxed{2^{35} - 1} is divisible by both 31 and 127.

To solve the given problems, we analyze the structure of the numbers and apply number theory principles.

### **(a) Prove that if $ d \mid n $, then $ 2^d - 1 \mid 2^n - 1 $**

We are given that $ d \mid n $, which implies that $ n = kd $ for some integer $ k $. We aim to show that $ 2^d - 1 $ divides $ 2^n - 1 $.

Let’s consider the expression:

$$
2^n - 1 = 2^{kd} - 1
$$

We can apply the **difference of powers** identity:

$$
a^{kd} - 1 = (a^d - 1)(a^{d(k-1)} + a^{d(k-2)} + \cdots + a^d + 1)
$$

Substituting $ a = 2 $, we get:

$$
2^{kd} - 1 = (2^d - 1)(2^{d(k-1)} + 2^{d(k-2)} + \cdots + 2^d + 1)
$$

This shows that $ 2^d - 1 $ is a factor of $ 2^n - 1 $, hence:

$$
2^d - 1 \mid 2^n - 1
$$

Alternatively, using **modular arithmetic**, observe that:

$$
2^d \equiv 1 \pmod{2^d - 1}
$$

Then:

$$
2^{kd} \equiv (2^d)^k \equiv 1^k \equiv 1 \pmod{2^d - 1}
\Rightarrow 2^{kd} - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{2^d - 1}
\Rightarrow 2^d - 1 \mid 2^n - 1
$$

Thus, both approaches confirm the result.

### **(b) Verify that $ 2^{35} - 1 $ is divisible by 31 and 127**

We are given the numbers 31 and 127, which are both **Mersenne primes**:

- $ 31 = 2^5 - 1 $
- $ 127 = 2^7 - 1 $

From part (a), if $ d \mid n $, then $ 2^d - 1 \mid 2^n - 1 $. Let's verify this with $ n = 35 $:

- Since $ 5 \mid 35 $, we have $ 2^5 - 1 = 31 \mid 2^{35} - 1 $
- Since $ 7 \mid 35 $, we have $ 2^7 - 1 = 127 \mid 2^{35} - 1 $

To further confirm, we can compute modulo:

#### **Modulo 31**:

$$
2^5 = 32 \equiv 1 \pmod{31} \Rightarrow 2^{35} = (2^5)^7 \equiv 1^7 = 1 \pmod{31}
\Rightarrow 2^{35} - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{31}
$$

#### **Modulo 127**:

$$
2^7 = 128 \equiv 1 \pmod{127} \Rightarrow 2^{35} = (2^7)^5 \equiv 1^5 = 1 \pmod{127}
\Rightarrow 2^{35} - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{127}
$$

Thus, both 31 and 127 divide $ 2^{35} - 1 $.

### **Final Answers**

(a) $\boxed{2^d - 1 \mid 2^n - 1}$

(b) $\boxed{2^{35} - 1}$ is divisible by both 31 and 127.
