 (a) Two triangular numbers whose sum and difference are also triangular numbers.

Let the two triangular numbers be $T_n$ and $T_m$, where $n$ and $m$ are positive integers.

The sum of $T_n$ and $T_m$ is $T_n + T_m = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{m(m+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2 + n + m^2 + m}{2}$.

The difference of $T_n$ and $T_m$ is $T_n - T_m = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - \frac{m(m+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2 + n - m^2 - m}{2}$.

For both the sum and difference to be triangular numbers, we need both of these expressions to be of the form $\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ for some positive integer $k$.

Let's consider the sum first. We have:

$\frac{n^2 + n + m^2 + m}{2} = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$

$n^2 + n + m^2 + m = k(k+1)$

Now, let's consider the difference:

$\frac{n^2 + n - m^2 - m}{2} = \frac{l(l+1)}{2}$

$n^2 + n - m^2 - m = l(l+1)$

We can see that the sum and difference are of the same form, so we can set them equal to each other:

$k(k+1) = l(l+1)$

This equation has solutions for $k$ and $l$ that are triangular numbers. For example, when $k=6$ and $l=5$, we have:

$6(6+1) = 5(5+1)$

$42 = 30$

This is not a valid solution, as the sum and difference are not equal. However, when $k=15$ and $l=14$, we have:

$15(15+1) = 14(14+1)$

$240 = 210$

This is also not a valid solution, as the sum and difference are not equal. However, when $k=30$ and $l=29$, we have:

$30(30+1) = 29(29+1)$

$930 = 930$

This is a valid solution, as the sum and difference are equal. Therefore, the two triangular numbers whose sum and difference are also triangular numbers are $T_{30}$ and $T_{29}$.

(b) Three successive triangular numbers whose product is a perfect square.

Let the three successive triangular numbers be $T_n$, $T_{n+1}$, and $T_{n+2}$.

The product of these three numbers is:

$T_n \cdot T_{n+1} \cdot T_{n+2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \cdot \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \cdot \frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}$

Simplifying, we get:

$T_n \cdot T_{n+1} \cdot T_{n+2} = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$

For the product to be a perfect square, we need the numerator to be a perfect square. This happens when $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$ is a perfect square.

Let's consider the case when $n=1$. We have:

$T_1 \cdot T_2 \cdot T_3 = \frac{1(1+1)(1+2)(1+3)}{8} = \frac{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4}{8} = 3$

This is not a perfect square. Let's consider the case when $n=2$. We have:

$T_2 \cdot T_3 \cdot T_4 = \frac{2(2+1)(2+2)(2+3)}{8} = \frac{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5}{8} = 15$

This is not a perfect square. Let's consider the case when $n=3$. We have:

$T_3 \cdot T_4 \cdot T_5 = \frac{3(3+1)(3+2)(3+3)}{8} = \frac{3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6}{8} = 45$

This is not a perfect square. Let's consider the case when $n=4$. We have:

$T_4 \cdot T_5 \cdot T_6 = \frac{4(4+1)(4+2)(4+3)}{8} = \frac{4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7}{8} = 105$

This is not a perfect square. Let's consider the case when $n=5$. We have:

$T_5 \cdot T_6 \cdot T_7 = \frac{5(5+1)(5+2)(5+3)}{8} = \frac{5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8}{8} = 420$

This is a perfect square. Therefore, the three successive triangular numbers whose product is a perfect square are $T_5$, $T_6$, and $T_7$.

(c) Three successive triangular numbers whose sum is a perfect square.

Let the three successive triangular numbers be $T_n$, $T_{n+1}$, and $T_{n+2}$.

The sum of these three numbers is:

$T_n + T_{n+1} + T_{n+2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} + \frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}$

Simplifying, we get:

$T_n + T_{n+1} + T_{n+2} = \frac{n(n+1) + (n+1)(n+2) + (n+2)(n+3)}{2}$

For the sum to be a perfect square, we need the numerator to be a perfect square. This happens when $n(n+1) + (n+1)(n+2) + (n+2)(n+3)$ is a perfect square.

Let's consider the case when $n=1$. We have:

$T_1 + T_2 + T_3 = \frac{1(1+1) + (1+1)(1+2) + (1+2)(1+3)}{2} = \frac{2 + 6 + 12}{2} = 10$

This is a perfect square. Therefore, the three successive triangular numbers whose sum is a perfect square are $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$.
