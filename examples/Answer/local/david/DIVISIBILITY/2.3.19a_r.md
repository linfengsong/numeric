 (a) We want to show that $6$ divides $a(a^2 + 11)$ for any integer $a$.

We can use the property of divisibility, which states that if $d$ divides $a$ and $d$ divides $b$, then $d$ divides $a+b$.

We can rewrite $a(a^2 + 11)$ as $a^3 + 11a$.

Now, we can use the property of divisibility to show that $6$ divides $a^3 + 11a$.

Since $6$ divides $6a$, we know that $6$ divides $a^3 + 11a$ if $6$ divides $a^3 - 6a$.

We can rewrite $a^3 - 6a$ as $a(a^2 - 6)$.

Now, we can use the property of divisibility to show that $6$ divides $a(a^2 - 6)$.

Since $6$ divides $6a$, we know that $6$ divides $a(a^2 - 6)$ if $6$ divides $a^2 - 6$.

We can rewrite $a^2 - 6$ as $a^2 - 2^2$.

Now, we can use the difference of squares factorization to show that $6$ divides $a^2 - 2^2$.

We have $a^2 - 2^2 = (a - 2)(a + 2)$.

Since $6$ divides $6$, we know that $6$ divides $(a - 2)(a + 2)$ if $6$ divides $a - 2$ or $6$ divides $a + 2$.

Since $a$ is an arbitrary integer, $a - 2$ and $a + 2$ can be any two consecutive integers.

Therefore, $6$ divides $a(a^2 + 11)$ for any integer $a$.

This establishes the assertion.
