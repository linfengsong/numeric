 To prove that $8 | (a^2 - b^2)$ for odd integers $a$ and $b$, we can use the property of odd numbers. An odd number can be represented as $2n + 1$, where $n$ is an integer.

Let $a = 2m + 1$ and $b = 2n + 1$ for some integers $m$ and $n$. Then,

$a^2 - b^2 = (2m + 1)^2 - (2n + 1)^2$

Expanding the squares, we get:

$a^2 - b^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 - 4n^2 - 4n - 1$

Simplifying, we have:

$a^2 - b^2 = 4m^2 + 4m - 4n^2 - 4n$

Factoring out a 4, we get:

$a^2 - b^2 = 4(m^2 + m - n^2 - n)$

Now, we can see that $m^2 + m - n^2 - n$ is an integer, since it is a difference of two integers. Let's denote this integer as $k$, so we have:

$a^2 - b^2 = 4k$

This means that $8 | (a^2 - b^2)$, as $8 = 2^3$ and $4 = 2^2$, and $2^3 | 2^2k$. Thus, we have established the assertion that if $a$ and $b$ are odd integers, then $8 | (a^2 - b^2)$.
