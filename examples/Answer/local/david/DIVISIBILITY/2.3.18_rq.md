Okay, so I need to prove that the product of any three consecutive integers is divisible by 6, four consecutive integers by 24, and five consecutive integers by 120. Hmm, let me start with the first one: three consecutive integers and divisibility by 6.

First, I remember that 6 is 2 times 3, so if I can show that the product has at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 3, then it's divisible by 6. Let me think about three consecutive numbers. Let's say the numbers are n, n+1, n+2. Among any three consecutive integers, there must be at least one even number, right? Because every other number is even. So that would give me the factor of 2. Then for the factor of 3, since every third number is a multiple of 3, in three consecutive numbers, one of them must be divisible by 3. So that gives me the factor of 3. Therefore, the product should be divisible by 2*3=6. That seems straightforward. But maybe I should check with examples to make sure.

Let me take n=1: 1*2*3=6, which is divisible by 6. n=2: 2*3*4=24, which is divisible by 6. n=3: 3*4*5=60, which is 6*10. Yeah, works. n=4: 4*5*6=120, which is 6*20. So seems like it works. So maybe that's the proof for the first part. But maybe I need to formalize it more.

Alternatively, maybe using modular arithmetic? For the divisibility by 2: in any three consecutive numbers, there's at least one even number. For divisibility by 3: in any three consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 3. So the product will have factors of 2 and 3, hence divisible by 6. That seems solid.

Now moving on to four consecutive integers and divisibility by 24. 24 is 8*3, or 4*6, or 2^3 * 3. So maybe I need to show that the product has at least three factors of 2 and one factor of 3. Let me think. Let's take four consecutive numbers: n, n+1, n+2, n+3.

First, for divisibility by 3: similar to before, in any three consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 3. But here we have four numbers, so in four consecutive numbers, there must be at least one multiple of 3. Wait, actually, if you have four numbers, the spacing is such that every third number is a multiple of 3. So, in four consecutive numbers, there could be one or two multiples of 3? Wait, no. For example, if n is divisible by 3, then n and n+3 would be multiples of 3. But n+3 is not in the four consecutive numbers unless n+3 is within the range. Wait, if the numbers are n, n+1, n+2, n+3, then if n is divisible by 3, then n is a multiple of 3. If n+1 is divisible by 3, then n+1 is a multiple. If n+2 is divisible by 3, then n+2 is a multiple. If n+3 is divisible by 3, then n+3 is a multiple. However, since they are consecutive, only one of them can be divisible by 3 unless there's a case where two are divisible by 3. Wait, but if n is divisible by 3, then n+3 is also divisible by 3, but n+3 is the fourth number. So if n is divisible by 3, then n and n+3 are both divisible by 3. But in the four consecutive numbers, n, n+1, n+2, n+3, if n is divisible by 3, then n+3 is also divisible by 3. So that would mean two multiples of 3. But if n is not divisible by 3, then maybe only one of the four numbers is divisible by 3. Wait, let me check with examples. Let me take n=1: 1,2,3,4. Here, 3 is divisible by 3. n=2: 2,3,4,5: 3 is divisible by 3. n=3: 3,4,5,6: both 3 and 6 are divisible by 3. So in this case, two multiples. n=4: 4,5,6,7: 6 is divisible by 3. n=5: 5,6,7,8: 6 is divisible by 3. n=6: 6,7,8,9: 6 and 9 are divisible by 3. So in general, in four consecutive numbers, there is either one or two multiples of 3. Therefore, the product will have at least one factor of 3. But since 24 requires one factor of 3, that's okay. But for the factors of 2, we need three factors of 2. Let me think.

In four consecutive numbers, there are two even numbers. Because every other number is even. So in four numbers, there are two even numbers. However, one of them might be divisible by 4, which would contribute two factors of 2. So the total number of factors of 2 would be at least 2 + 1 = 3? Wait, if one of the even numbers is divisible by 4, then that gives two factors of 2, and the other even number gives one factor of 2. So total of three factors of 2. Therefore, the product would have at least 2^3 * 3, which is 24. Therefore, the product is divisible by 24. Let me check with examples.

Take n=1: 1*2*3*4=24, which is 24. n=2: 2*3*4*5=120, which is divisible by 24 (120/24=5). n=3: 3*4*5*6=360, 360/24=15. n=4: 4*5*6*7=840, 840/24=35. n=5: 5*6*7*8=1680, 1680/24=70. Seems okay. But let me check a case where there's only one multiple of 4. For example, n=2: 2,3,4,5. Here, 2 and 4 are even. 4 is divisible by 4, so 2^2 and 2^1, total 2^3. So that works. If n=1: 1,2,3,4. 2 and 4 are even. Same thing. If n=5: 5,6,7,8. 6 and 8 are even. 8 is divisible by 8 (2^3), so 6 is 2*3, so total factors of 2: 3 from 8 and 1 from 6, total 4? Wait, but 8 is 2^3, and 6 is 2^1, so total 2^4. So that would be more than enough. Wait, so in any case, the product will have at least three factors of 2? Let me think again. In four consecutive numbers, there are two even numbers. One of them is divisible by 4, so that gives at least two factors of 2, and the other even number is divisible by 2, so that gives one more factor. So total of three factors of 2. Therefore, the product has 2^3 * 3, hence divisible by 24. Therefore, the product of four consecutive integers is divisible by 24. So that seems to work.

But wait, is there a case where there are only one even number? No, because in four consecutive numbers, there are two even numbers. Because every other number is even. So in four numbers, two even, two odd. So that's correct. So even if one is divisible by 4, and the other is divisible by 2, you get three factors of 2. Therefore, the product is divisible by 8 and 3, hence 24. So that's the proof for the second part.

Now, moving on to five consecutive integers and divisibility by 120. 120 is 5! = 5*4*3*2*1. So 5*24. So similar logic. Let me think. The product of five consecutive integers should have factors of 5, 4, 3, 2, etc. So maybe we need to show that the product is divisible by 5, 4, 3, 2, etc. But since 120 is 5*24, and we already know that the product of four consecutive integers is divisible by 24, then if we have five consecutive integers, the product would be divisible by 24 and also by 5. Therefore, since 24 and 5 are coprime, the product would be divisible by 24*5=120. That might be a way to think about it. But let me verify.

Alternatively, breaking down 120 into prime factors: 2^3 * 3 * 5. So we need to show that the product has at least three factors of 2, one factor of 3, and one factor of 5. Let me check for each of these.

First, for the factor of 5: in five consecutive integers, there must be one multiple of 5. Because every fifth number is a multiple of 5. So in any five consecutive numbers, exactly one of them is divisible by 5. So that gives us the factor of 5.

For the factor of 3: similar to before, in five consecutive integers, there is at least one multiple of 3. Because every three numbers have a multiple of 3. So in five numbers, there must be at least one multiple of 3. Actually, even more, since 5 is larger than 3, there could be one or two multiples of 3. For example, if the numbers are 3,4,5,6,7: 3 and 6 are multiples of 3. So two multiples. But even if there is one, it's enough for divisibility by 3.

For the factors of 2: similar to the four consecutive numbers case. Let's think. In five consecutive numbers, there are two or three even numbers. Let me think. In five consecutive numbers, there are two or three even numbers. For example, if the first number is even: even, odd, even, odd, even. So three even numbers. If the first number is odd: odd, even, odd, even, odd. So two even numbers. Therefore, in any case, there are at least two even numbers. However, to get three factors of 2, we need to check if there is at least one multiple of 4. Because if there are two even numbers, one of them could be divisible by 4, contributing two factors of 2, and the other is divisible by 2, contributing one factor, so total three factors. If there are three even numbers, then at least one of them is divisible by 4, so again, similar logic. Wait, let me think again. Let me take an example.

Case 1: Five consecutive numbers starting with even: n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4. If n is even, then n, n+2, n+4 are even. So three even numbers. Among these, one of them is divisible by 4. For example, if n is divisible by 4, then n is divisible by 4, and n+2 and n+4 are even but not divisible by 4. If n is 2 mod 4, then n+2 is 0 mod 4. Similarly, if n is 0 mod 4, then n is divisible by 4. So in any case, among three even numbers, there is at least one divisible by 4. Therefore, the number of factors of 2 would be at least 2 (from the multiple of 4) plus 1 (from the other even number) plus another one if there's another multiple of 2? Wait, no. Wait, there are three even numbers. If one is divisible by 4 (which is 2^2) and the other two are divisible by 2 (but not 4), then total factors of 2 would be 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. Which is more than enough for 2^3. If there are two even numbers, like when starting with odd: n is odd, so n+1, n+3, n+5? Wait, no. Wait, five consecutive numbers starting with odd: odd, even, odd, even, odd. So two even numbers. For example, n=1: 1,2,3,4,5. Even numbers are 2 and 4. 4 is divisible by 4, so factors of 2: 2^1 (from 2) and 2^2 (from 4). Total factors of 2: 3. Which is exactly 2^3. So that's sufficient. If the two even numbers are 2 and 6, then 2 is 2^1 and 6 is 2^1 * 3, so total factors of 2 is 2. Wait, but that would be insufficient? Wait, but in five consecutive numbers, if the even numbers are 2 and 6, then the numbers would be 1,2,3,4,5? Wait, no, if starting with odd, say n=3: 3,4,5,6,7. Even numbers are 4 and 6. 4 is 2^2, 6 is 2*3. So total factors of 2: 2 + 1 = 3. Which is okay. If the even numbers are, say, 2 and 6 in some other case? Wait, let me think. If the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Even numbers are 6 and 8. 6 is 2*3, 8 is 2^3. So total factors of 2: 1 + 3 = 4. So that's more than enough. If the numbers are 7,8,9,10,11. Even numbers are 8 and 10. 8 is 2^3, 10 is 2*5. Total factors of 2: 3 + 1 = 4. So again, more than enough. Wait, but is there a case where the two even numbers contribute only two factors of 2? For example, if the even numbers are 2 and 2? No, because they are consecutive numbers. Wait, the even numbers are two apart. For example, in the case of numbers 1,2,3,4,5: even numbers are 2 and 4. 2 is 2^1, 4 is 2^2. So total factors of 2: 1 + 2 = 3. So that's exactly 3. So that's sufficient. If the numbers are 2,3,4,5,6: even numbers are 2,4,6. Then 2 is 2^1, 4 is 2^2, 6 is 2^1. Total factors of 2: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So that's even more. So in any case, whether there are two or three even numbers, the total number of factors of 2 is at least three. Therefore, the product will have at least 2^3, 3^1, and 5^1, which is 8*3*5=120. Therefore, the product is divisible by 120.

But let me check with examples. Take n=1: 1*2*3*4*5=120, which is exactly 120. n=2: 2*3*4*5*6=720. 720 divided by 120 is 6. n=3: 3*4*5*6*7=2520. 2520/120=21. n=4: 4*5*6*7*8=6720. 6720/120=56. n=5: 5*6*7*8*9= 5*6*7*8*9= 5*6=30, 30*7=210, 210*8=1680, 1680*9=15120. 15120/120=126. So all of these are divisible by 120. So that seems to hold.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more formal way to prove this. For example, using induction or combinatorial arguments. But maybe the way I did it is sufficient. Let me think about another approach. Since the product of n consecutive integers is divisible by n! So in general, the product of k consecutive integers is divisible by k!. Therefore, for k=3, 3! = 6; k=4, 4! =24; k=5, 5! =120. Therefore, the statement is a general result. But maybe the question expects a more elementary proof, not invoking the general formula.

But if I can recall, the general formula is that the product of k consecutive integers is divisible by k! because in the product, there are enough multiples of primes. However, maybe I need to explain that. But since the problem is about three, four, five consecutive integers, maybe the above reasoning is sufficient.

Alternatively, using the concept of combinations. The number of ways to choose k elements from n is C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)! ). But this might be more advanced. However, since the product of k consecutive integers is k! times C(n, k) or something like that. Wait, actually, the product of k consecutive integers starting at m is m(m+1)...(m + k -1) = k! * C(m + k -1, k). Therefore, since combinations are integers, the product is divisible by k!.

Therefore, that's a general proof. However, if the problem expects a more elementary proof, then maybe the previous
