Okay, so I need to prove that if a and b are odd integers, then 8 divides (a² - b²). Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, since both a and b are odd, maybe I can express them in terms of some other integers. Like, any odd integer can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k, right? Let me try that. 

Let me set a = 2k + 1 and b = 2m + 1, where k and m are integers. Then, I can compute a² - b² and see if it's divisible by 8. 

So, let's compute a² first. 

a² = (2k + 1)² = 4k² + 4k + 1. 

Similarly, b² = (2m + 1)² = 4m² + 4m + 1. 

Therefore, a² - b² = (4k² + 4k + 1) - (4m² + 4m + 1) = 4k² + 4k - 4m² - 4m. 

Simplifying that, we get 4(k² + k - m² - m). 

Hmm, so the difference is 4 times something. But we need to show that 8 divides this difference. That means that the something inside the parentheses must be even, right? Because 4 times an even number is divisible by 8. 

So let me check if k² + k - m² - m is even. Let me look at k² + k. 

Wait, k² + k is k(k + 1). And since k and k + 1 are consecutive integers, one of them must be even. So their product is always even. Similarly, m² + m is also even. Therefore, k² + k - m² - m is even minus even, which is even. 

Therefore, the entire expression a² - b² is 4 times an even number, which is 8 times some integer. Hence, 8 divides a² - b². 

Wait, let me verify that again. Let me take specific numbers to test. Let's pick a = 3 and b = 1. Then a² - b² = 9 - 1 = 8. 8 divides 8, which is true. 

Another example: a = 5, b = 3. Then a² - b² = 25 - 9 = 16. 16 is divisible by 8. 

Another example: a = 7, b = 5. 49 - 25 = 24, which is divisible by 8. 

What if a and b are negative? Let's try a = -1, b = -3. Then a² - b² = 1 - 9 = -8, which is divisible by 8. 

Another case: a = 1, b = 1. Then 1 - 1 = 0. 0 is divisible by 8, since 0 divided by 8 is 0. 

Okay, so the examples check out. But maybe I should try to think of another way to approach this. Maybe using modular arithmetic? 

Since a and b are odd, they are congruent to 1 or 3 or 5 or 7 modulo 8. Let me check the squares of odd numbers modulo 8. 

Let me compute the squares of 1, 3, 5, 7 modulo 8:

1² = 1 mod 8

3² = 9 ≡ 1 mod 8

5² = 25 ≡ 1 mod 8

7² = 49 ≡ 1 mod 8

Wait, so all odd numbers squared are congruent to 1 modulo 8? Then, if that's the case, then a² ≡ 1 mod 8 and b² ≡ 1 mod 8, so a² - b² ≡ 1 - 1 ≡ 0 mod 8. Therefore, 8 divides a² - b². 

Oh, that seems much simpler. But why does squaring an odd number give 1 mod 8? Let me confirm. 

Take an odd integer, which can be written as 2k + 1. Then, (2k + 1)² = 4k² + 4k + 1 = 4k(k + 1) + 1. 

Now, k(k + 1) is always even because it's the product of two consecutive integers. Therefore, 4k(k + 1) is divisible by 8, since 4 times an even number is 8 times something. Hence, (2k + 1)² ≡ 1 mod 8. 

Therefore, regardless of the odd integer, its square is congruent to 1 modulo 8. Therefore, the difference between two squares of odd integers is 1 - 1 = 0 modulo 8, so it's divisible by 8. 

Therefore, this gives another way to see it. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the difference of squares formula. 

a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). 

Since a and b are both odd, then a - b and a + b are both even. Because odd minus odd is even, and odd plus odd is even. 

Therefore, both (a - b) and (a + b) are even. Let me write them as 2k and 2m. 

Wait, but more precisely, since a and b are odd, let me denote a = 2k + 1 and b = 2m + 1. Then, a - b = 2k + 1 - 2m - 1 = 2(k - m), which is 2 times an integer, so even. Similarly, a + b = 2k + 1 + 2m + 1 = 2(k + m + 1), which is also even. 

Therefore, (a - b)(a + b) = [2(k - m)][2(k + m + 1)] = 4(k - m)(k + m + 1). 

So, the product is 4 times something. Now, we need to show that this is divisible by 8, so that something must be even. 

So, let's check if (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even. 

Note that k - m and k + m + 1. Let me think about their parity. 

Let me consider two cases: whether k - m is even or odd. 

But maybe there's a better way. Let me note that among any two consecutive integers, one is even. But here, we have two terms: (k - m) and (k + m + 1). 

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider whether (k - m) and (k + m + 1) are both even or one is even and the other is odd. 

Alternatively, let me consider the product (k - m)(k + m + 1). Let me denote x = k - m and y = k + m + 1. 

But maybe instead of that, think about whether x and y have the same parity or different. 

Alternatively, think about the sum of k - m and k + m + 1. 

Wait, maybe not. Let me think of specific examples. 

Suppose k and m are integers. Let me take k and m such that... Let me think of k - m and k + m + 1. Let me check their parity. 

Let me note that k - m and k + m + 1. Let me compute their sum: (k - m) + (k + m + 1) = 2k + 1. Which is odd. 

Therefore, if the sum of two numbers is odd, then one is even and the other is odd. Therefore, their product is even. 

Because if one is even and the other is odd, their product is even. 

Therefore, (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even. Therefore, 4 times even is 8 times something. Therefore, the entire expression is divisible by 8. 

Therefore, that's another way to see it. 

Therefore, combining these methods, we can see that regardless of the approach, the conclusion is that 8 divides a² - b². 

Wait, so the difference of squares factors into (a - b)(a + b), both of which are even, and their product is divisible by 8 because one of the factors is divisible by 4 or something? Wait, no, in the previous step, we saw that (k - m)(k + m + 1) is even, so 4 times even is 8 times something. 

Alternatively, since (a - b) and (a + b) are both even, then each is divisible by 2, so their product is divisible by 4. But we need divisibility by 8. So, we need to check if one of them is divisible by 4. 

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Suppose that (a - b) and (a + b) are both even. Let me denote a - b = 2p and a + b = 2q. Then, the product is 4pq. So, 4pq must be divisible by 8, so pq must be even. 

Therefore, pq is even. Which means that either p or q is even. 

But p = (a - b)/2 and q = (a + b)/2. 

Since a and b are both odd, then a - b is even, so p is integer, and same with q. 

So, we need to check if p or q is even. 

But how can we show that? 

Let me think. Let me consider that a and b are both odd. So, a = 2k + 1, b = 2m + 1. Then, p = (a - b)/2 = (2k + 1 - 2m - 1)/2 = (2(k - m))/2 = k - m. 

Similarly, q = (a + b)/2 = (2k + 1 + 2m + 1)/2 = (2(k + m + 1))/2 = k + m + 1. 

So, p = k - m and q = k + m + 1. 

Earlier, we saw that p + q = 2k + 1, which is odd. Therefore, p and q have opposite parity. So, one is even and one is odd. Therefore, pq is even. Therefore, 4pq is divisible by 8. 

Therefore, this shows that the product is divisible by 8. 

So, this is another way to see it. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use parity. Since a and b are odd, then a = 2k + 1, b = 2m + 1. Then, a + b = 2(k + m + 1), so it's divisible by 2. Similarly, a - b = 2(k - m), also divisible by 2. 

But to get divisibility by 8, we need that one of the terms is divisible by 4. 

Wait, suppose that a and b are both odd. Then, a ≡ 1 or 3 mod 4. Similarly for b. Let me check. 

If a is odd, then it's either 1 or 3 mod 4. Similarly for b. 

Let me consider a - b and a + b modulo 4. 

Case 1: a ≡ 1 mod 4 and b ≡ 1 mod 4. Then, a - b ≡ 0 mod 4 and a + b ≡ 2 mod 4. 

Case 2: a ≡ 1 mod 4 and b ≡ 3 mod 4. Then, a - b ≡ -2 ≡ 2 mod 4 and a + b ≡ 0 mod 4. 

Case 3: a ≡ 3 mod 4 and b ≡ 1 mod 4. Then, a - b ≡ 2 mod 4 and a + b ≡ 0 mod 4. 

Case 4: a ≡ 3 mod 4 and b ≡ 3 mod 4. Then, a - b ≡ 0 mod 4 and a + b ≡ 2 mod 4. 

Therefore, in each case, either a - b or a + b is divisible by 4. Therefore, one of them is divisible by 4 and the other is divisible by 2. Therefore, their product is divisible by 4 * 2 = 8. 

Therefore, this shows that (a - b)(a + b) is divisible by 8. 

So, this is another way to think about it. 

So, whether I use algebraic manipulation, modular arithmetic, or factoring, I get that 8 divides a² - b². 

Therefore, the assertion is true. 

But just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me think of another approach. 

Suppose we take a and b as odd integers. Then, a = 2k + 1 and b = 2m + 1. Then, a² - b² = (2k + 1)^2 - (2m + 1)^2 = 4k² + 4k + 1 - 4m² - 4m - 1 = 4(k² + k - m² - m). 

Now, k² + k is equal to k(k + 1). Which is the product of two consecutive integers, so it is always even. Similarly, m² + m is even. Therefore, k² + k - m² - m is even - even = even. Therefore, 4 times even is 8 times integer. 

Therefore, this is another way. 

So, all methods lead to the same conclusion. 

Therefore, I can be confident that the assertion is correct. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{8}
</think>

To establish the assertion that if $ a $ and $ b $ are odd integers, then $ 8 \mid (a^2 - b^2) $, we can approach the problem using multiple methods. Here's a structured and thorough proof.

---

### **1. Algebraic Approach**

We begin by expressing the odd integers $ a $ and $ b $ in terms of integers:

$$
a = 2k + 1, \quad b = 2m + 1
$$

for some integers $ k, m $. Then we compute:

$$
a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
$$
$$
b^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1
$$

Subtracting:

$$
a^2 - b^2 = (4k^2 + 4k + 1) - (4m^2 + 4m + 1) = 4(k^2 + k - m^2 - m)
$$

Now, observe that $ k^2 + k = k(k + 1) $ is the product of two consecutive integers, which is always even. Similarly, $ m^2 + m = m(m + 1) $ is also even. Thus:

$$
k^2 + k - m^2 - m = \text{even} - \text{even} = \text{even}
$$

So, $ a^2 - b^2 = 4 \times \text{even} = 8 \times \text{integer} $, which implies:

$$
8 \mid (a^2 - b^2)
$$

---

### **2. Modular Arithmetic Approach**

Any odd integer $ x $ satisfies $ x \equiv 1, 3, 5, $ or $ 7 \mod 8 $. Let’s square each:

- $ 1^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 $
- $ 3^2 = 9 \equiv 1 \mod 8 $
- $ 5^2 = 25 \equiv 1 \mod 8 $
- $ 7^2 = 49 \equiv 1 \mod 8 $

Thus, for any odd $ a $ and $ b $, we have:

$$
a^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8, \quad b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8
$$

Therefore:

$$
a^2 - b^2 \equiv 1 - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 8
$$

This confirms that $ 8 \mid (a^2 - b^2) $.

---

### **3. Factoring and Parity Argument**

Using the difference of squares identity:

$$
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
$$

Since both $ a $ and $ b $ are odd, their sum and difference are even:

- $ a - b = 2k $ for some integer $ k $
- $ a + b = 2m $ for some integer $ m $

So:

$$
a^2 - b^2 = (2k)(2m) = 4km
$$

Now, to show that $ 8 \mid (a^2 - b^2) $, we need $ km $ to be even. Let’s examine the parity of $ k $ and $ m $.

From earlier, we showed that:

$$
k = \frac{a - b}{2}, \quad m = \frac{a + b}{2}
$$

Then:

$$
k + m = \frac{a - b}{2} + \frac{a + b}{2} = a
$$

Since $ a $ is odd, $ k + m $ is odd. Therefore, $ k $ and $ m $ must have **opposite parity** — one is even, the other is odd. Thus, their product $ km $ is even, and:

$$
4km = 8 \times \text{integer}
$$

Therefore, $ 8 \mid (a^2 - b^2) $.

---

### **Conclusion**

All methods — algebraic manipulation, modular arithmetic, and factoring with parity analysis — confirm that if $ a $ and $ b $ are odd integers, then $ a^2 - b^2 $ is divisible by 8.
