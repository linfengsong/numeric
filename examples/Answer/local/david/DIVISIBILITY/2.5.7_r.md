 Let the check be written for $a.a$ cents. Then the teller cashed the check for $100a+a$ cents, or $a.a$ dollars. Mr. Smith spent 68 cents, so he was left with $(a.a-68)$ dollars. But this was twice the amount of the check, so \[
2(100a+a)=a.a-68 \quad\text{or}\quad 202a = a^2-68.
\]Rearranging and factoring, we get $a^2-202a-68=0$, which factors as $(a-203)(a+3)=0$. The root $a=203$ is the only one that makes sense, so the check was originally for $203$ cents, or $\$2.03$.
