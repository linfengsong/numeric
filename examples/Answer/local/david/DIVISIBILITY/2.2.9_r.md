 Let $n$ be an integer that is simultaneously a square and a cube. Then we can write $n = a^2 = b^3$ for some integers $a$ and $b$.

We can write $a$ and $b$ in the form $7k + r$ for some integers $k$ and $r$, where $0 \leq r < 7$. Then we have:

$n = a^2 = (7k + r)^2 = 49k^2 + 14kr + r^2$

and

$n = b^3 = (7k + r)^3 = 343k^3 + 147k^2r + 21kr^2 + r^3$.

Since $n$ is both a square and a cube, we have:

$49k^2 + 14kr + r^2 = 343k^3 + 147k^2r + 21kr^2 + r^3$.

Rearranging terms, we get:

$343k^3 - 49k^2 + 21kr - 14kr^2 + r^3 - r^2 = 0$.

Factoring out a $k^2$ from the first two terms and a $k$ from the next two terms, we get:

$k^2(343k - 49) + kr(21k - 14r) + r^3 - r^2 = 0$.

Since $k^2$ and $kr$ are integers, the left-hand side of the equation must be a multiple of $7$. Therefore, $r^3 - r^2$ must be a multiple of $7$.

We can factor $r^3 - r^2$ as $r^2(r - 1)$. Since $0 \leq r < 7$, the possible values of $r^2(r - 1)$ are $0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6$. Therefore, $r^2(r - 1)$ is always a multiple of $7$.

Since $r^3 - r^2$ is a multiple of $7$, and $r^2(r - 1)$ is always a multiple of $7$, it follows that $r^3$ must be a multiple of $7$. The only possible values of $r$ that satisfy this condition are $r = 0$ or $r = 1$.

Therefore, $n = a^2 = (7k + r)^2$ must be of the form $7k$ or $7k + 1$.
