 (a) We are given that $t_n$ is a perfect square. The $n$-th triangular number is defined as $t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. We want to show that $t_{4n(n+1)}$ is also a square.

Let's first simplify the expression for $t_{4n(n+1)}$:

$t_{4n(n+1)} = \frac{4n(n+1)(4n(n+1)+1)}{2}$

We can factor out a $4n(n+1)$ from the numerator:

$t_{4n(n+1)} = 2n(n+1)(4n(n+1)+1)$

Now, we can use the fact that $t_n$ is a perfect square to simplify the expression further. Since $t_n$ is a perfect square, we can write $n(n+1) = k^2$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the expression for $t_{4n(n+1)}$ gives:

$t_{4n(n+1)} = 2k^2(4k^2+1)$

Now, we can see that $t_{4n(n+1)}$ is a product of two consecutive even numbers, $2k^2$ and $4k^2+1$. The product of two consecutive even numbers is always a square, so $t_{4n(n+1)}$ is also a square.

(b) To find three examples of squares that are also triangular numbers, we can use the formula for the $n$-th triangular number and look for perfect square values of $n$. 

For $n=1$, we have $t_1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1$, which is a square.

For $n=3$, we have $t_3 = \frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6$, which is not a square.

For $n=4$, we have $t_4 = \frac{4(4+1)}{2} = 10$, which is not a square.

For $n=9$, we have $t_9 = \frac{9(9+1)}{2} = 45$, which is not a square.

For $n=16$, we have $t_{16} = \frac{16(16+1)}{2} = 136$, which is not a square.

For $n=25$, we have $t_{25} = \frac{25(25+1)}{2} = 325$, which is not a square.

For $n=36$, we have $t_{36} = \frac{36(36+1)}{2} = 666$, which is not a square.

For $n=49$, we have $t_{49} = \frac{49(49+1)}{2} = 1225$, which is a square.

So, the three examples of squares that are also triangular numbers are $1$, $136$, and $1225$.
