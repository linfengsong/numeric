Okay, so I need to prove that none of the numbers in the sequence 11, 111, 1111, 11111, and so on are perfect squares. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, let me recall what a perfect square is. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. So, for example, 16 is a perfect square because it's 4 squared. The numbers in the sequence given are all numbers made up of 1s, right? Like 11, which is two 1s, then 111 with three, and so on. 

So, maybe I can try to represent these numbers in a mathematical form. Let me see. Each term in the sequence has n ones. For example, the first term is 11, which is 10 + 1, the second term is 100 + 10 + 1, the third term is 1000 + 100 + 10 + 1, etc. So, in general, the nth term can be written as a sum of powers of 10. 

Let me write that down. Let's denote the nth term as N(n). Then:

N(n) = 10^{n-1} + 10^{n-2} + ... + 10^1 + 10^0.

This is a geometric series. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is (r^{k} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio and k is the number of terms. In this case, the common ratio r is 10, and the number of terms is n. So:

N(n) = (10^n - 1)/9.

Let me check that. For n=2, (10^2 - 1)/9 = (100 - 1)/9 = 99/9 = 11. Correct. For n=3, (1000 - 1)/9 = 999/9 = 111. Yep, that works. So, the general term is N(n) = (10^n - 1)/9.

So, now the problem reduces to proving that (10^n - 1)/9 is never a perfect square for any positive integer n ≥ 2. Wait, actually, the first term is n=2, but maybe n starts at 1? Let me check. For n=1, it would be (10^1 -1)/9 = 9/9 = 1, which is 1^2. But the sequence given starts at 11, which is n=2. So maybe the problem is about n ≥ 2. But maybe I need to check if n=1 is included or not. However, since the problem says "the following sequence: 11, 111, 1111, ...", so starting from two 1s. So n ≥ 2.

So, we need to show that for all integers n ≥ 2, (10^n - 1)/9 is not a perfect square.

Alright, so how do I approach this? Maybe consider modulo arithmetic? Or maybe look at the properties of numbers that are perfect squares.

First, let me check small values of n to see if they are squares. For n=2: 11. Is 11 a square? No. n=3: 111. Is that a square? Let me check sqrt(111) ≈ 10.535... Not an integer. n=4: 1111. sqrt(1111) ≈ 33.33... Not an integer. n=5: 11111. sqrt(11111) ≈ 105.4... Not integer. n=6: 111111. sqrt(111111) ≈ 333.33... Not integer. Hmm. So maybe there's a pattern here. But just checking small numbers isn't enough. I need a general proof.

Let me think about the equation:

(10^n - 1)/9 = k^2 for some integer k.

So, multiplying both sides by 9:

10^n - 1 = 9k^2.

Rearranged:

10^n = 9k^2 + 1.

So, 10^n ≡ 1 mod 9. Wait, 10 ≡ 1 mod 9, so 10^n ≡ 1^n ≡ 1 mod 9. Therefore, 9k^2 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 9. Which is consistent, so this doesn't give any new information. So maybe looking at modulo something else.

Alternatively, maybe look at modulo 4 or modulo 5 or something else. Let me think. Let's try modulo 4. Let's see.

First, perfect squares modulo 4 can be 0 or 1. Let me check the value of N(n) modulo 4.

For n ≥ 2, let's compute N(n) mod 4.

But N(n) = (10^n - 1)/9. Let's compute 10^n mod 36? Wait, maybe not. Let me compute N(n) mod 4.

First, 10 ≡ 2 mod 4. So 10^n ≡ 2^n mod 4. For n ≥ 2, 2^n is 0 mod 4. Therefore, 10^n ≡ 0 mod 4. Therefore, 10^n - 1 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. Then N(n) = (10^n -1)/9. But 9 is 1 mod 4. So dividing by 9 mod 4 is multiplying by inverse of 9 mod 4. Since 9 ≡ 1 mod 4, inverse is 1. Therefore, N(n) ≡ 3 mod 4. 

But perfect squares mod 4 are 0 or 1. Therefore, if N(n) ≡ 3 mod 4, then it cannot be a perfect square. Wait, but that would mean that for all n ≥ 2, N(n) ≡ 3 mod 4, which is not a square. Therefore, the conclusion is that none of the numbers in the sequence are perfect squares. 

Wait, is that true? Let me check with n=2. N(2)=11. 11 mod 4 is 3. Which is not a square. For n=3, 111 mod 4: 111 divided by 4 is 27*4 + 3, so 3 mod 4. Same for n=4: 1111 divided by 4: 277*4 + 3, so 3 mod 4. So indeed, for all n ≥ 2, N(n) ≡ 3 mod 4. Since squares mod 4 are 0 or 1, this would imply that N(n) cannot be a square. Therefore, the conclusion is that none of the numbers in the sequence are perfect squares. 

Wait, so is this a valid proof? Let me check again. 

First, we have N(n) = (10^n - 1)/9. For n ≥ 2, 10^n is divisible by 4, since 10 is divisible by 2, and 10^n is 2^n * 5^n. For n ≥ 2, 2^n is divisible by 4, so 10^n ≡ 0 mod 4. Therefore, 10^n -1 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. Then, since 9 ≡ 1 mod 4, dividing by 9 is the same as multiplying by 1, so N(n) ≡ 3 mod 4. Since squares mod 4 are 0 or 1, N(n) cannot be a square. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that none of the numbers in the sequence are perfect squares. 

But wait, let me check if there is any possible mistake here. For example, is dividing by 9 mod 4 valid? Let me think. If we have (a)/b mod m, we need to ensure that b is invertible mod m. Since 9 and 4 are coprime (gcd(9,4)=1), so 9 is invertible mod 4. The inverse of 9 mod 4 is the same as inverse of 1 mod 4, which is 1. Therefore, (10^n -1)/9 mod 4 is equal to (10^n -1)/9 mod 4, which is (3)/1 mod 4, which is 3. So yes, that's correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of N(n) as follows. Since N(n) = 111...1 (n times). Let me compute N(n) mod 4. Let's take n=2: 11 mod 4 is 3. n=3: 111 mod 4 is 111 - 27*4 = 111 - 108 = 3. Similarly, n=4: 1111 - 277*4 = 1111 - 1108 = 3. So indeed, for any n ≥ 2, N(n) ≡ 3 mod 4. Therefore, since squares are 0 or 1 mod 4, N(n) cannot be a square. 

Therefore, this seems like a solid proof. But let me check if there's another way to approach this, just to make sure.

Another approach: Let me consider the equation (10^n - 1)/9 = k^2. Then, 10^n - 1 = 9k^2. So, 10^n = 9k^2 + 1. Let me think about this equation. 

Let me check modulo 5. Let's see. 10^n mod 5 is 0, since 10 is divisible by 5. Therefore, 0 ≡ 9k^2 + 1 mod 5. Therefore, 9k^2 ≡ -1 mod 5. Since 9 ≡ 4 mod 5, so 4k^2 ≡ -1 mod 5. Which is 4k^2 ≡ 4 mod 5. Dividing both sides by 4 (since 4 and 5 are coprime), we get k^2 ≡ 1 mod 5. Therefore, k ≡ ±1 mod 5. So that doesn't give a contradiction, but just tells us something about k. 

Alternatively, maybe looking modulo 10? Let me see. For N(n) to be a square, its last digit must be 0,1,4,5,6,9. Let's check the last digit of N(n). All numbers in the sequence end with 1. So, the last digit is 1. So, possible. For example, 1, 9, 1, 9, etc. Wait, squares ending with 1 have their roots ending with 1 or 9. So that's possible. So modulo 10 doesn't rule anything out.

Alternatively, maybe modulo 3? Let's see. 10 ≡ 1 mod 3, so 10^n ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, 10^n - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, N(n) = (10^n -1)/9. Let me compute N(n) mod 3. Since 10^n -1 is divisible by 9, so N(n) is integer. Let me compute (10^n -1)/9 mod 3. Let me note that 10 ≡ 1 mod 3, so 10^n ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, 10^n -1 ≡ 0 mod 3, so (10^n -1)/9 ≡ 0/9 mod 3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, since 10^n -1 is divisible by 9, so N(n) is integer. Let me compute N(n) mod 3. Let me write N(n) as (10^n -1)/9. Let me compute 10^n -1 mod 27? Maybe not. Alternatively, since 10 ≡ 1 mod 3, so 10^n ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, 10^n -1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, (10^n -1)/9 is equal to (something divisible by 3)/9. Wait, 10^n -1 is divisible by 9, so (10^n -1)/9 is an integer. Let me compute N(n) mod 3. Let me compute N(n) = 11...1 with n digits. Let me compute N(n) mod 3. Since 10 ≡ 1 mod 3, so each digit contributes 1*10^k ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, the sum of digits is n, so N(n) ≡ n mod 3. Therefore, N(n) ≡ n mod 3. 

But if N(n) is a square, then N(n) ≡ 0,1 mod 3. Because squares mod 3 are 0 or 1. Therefore, n ≡ 0 or 1 mod 3. Therefore, if n ≡ 2 mod 3, then N(n) ≡ 2 mod 3, which cannot be a square. Therefore, for n ≡ 2 mod 3, N(n) is not a square. But for n ≡ 0 or 1 mod 3, it's possible. So this gives a partial result. 

But since our previous modulo 4 argument already shows that for all n ≥ 2, N(n) ≡ 3 mod 4, which cannot be a square, regardless of n. Therefore, even if n ≡ 0 or 1 mod 3, the modulo 4 condition already rules out the possibility. Therefore, combining both, the conclusion is that N(n) cannot be a square. 

Therefore, the modulo 4 argument seems sufficient. 

Wait, but let me check if there's a case where N(n) could be a square. For example, suppose n=1: N(1)=1, which is 1^2. But the problem starts from n=2. So, the problem is about n ≥ 2, and for those n, N(n) ≡ 3 mod 4, which is not a square. Therefore, the conclusion is that none of the numbers in the sequence are perfect squares. 

But let me check another modulus to be thorough. For example, modulo 5. Let me compute N(n) mod 5. 

Since N(n) = (10^n - 1)/9. Let me compute 10^n mod 5. 10 ≡ 0 mod 5, so 10^n ≡ 0 mod 5. Therefore, 10^n -1 ≡ -1 mod 5. Therefore, (10^n -1)/9 ≡ (-1)/9 mod 5. Since 9 ≡ 4 mod 5, so we have (-1)/4 mod 5. The inverse of 4 mod 5 is 4, since 4*4=16 ≡ 1 mod 5. Therefore, (-1)/4 ≡ -1 * 4 ≡ -4 ≡ 1 mod 5. Therefore, N(n) ≡ 1 mod 5. 

So squares mod 5 can be 0,1,4. Therefore, N(n) ≡ 1 mod 5 is possible. So that doesn't rule anything out. 

Alternatively, maybe modulo 7? Let me try. 

But maybe this is getting too complicated. The modulo 4 argument seems sufficient. 

Alternatively, maybe think about the equation again: 10^n = 9k^2 + 1. Let me think about this as a Diophantine equation. 

So, 10^n - 9k^2 = 1. 

This resembles a Pell equation, but Pell equations are usually of the form x^2 - Dy^2 = N. Let me see if I can manipulate this equation. 

Alternatively, think of 10^n - 1 = 9k^2. So, 10^n - 1 must be divisible by 9, which it is, as we saw. 

Alternatively, maybe consider the equation 10^n - 9k^2 = 1. Let me think about possible solutions. 

For n=1: 10 - 9k^2 = 1 => 9k^2 = 9 => k^2 = 1 => k=1. So that's the case n=1, which is 1. But the problem is about n ≥ 2. 

For n=2: 100 - 9k^2 = 1 => 9k^2 = 99 => k^2 = 11. Not integer. 

n=3: 1000 - 9k^2 = 1 => 9k^2 = 999 => k^2 = 111. Not integer. 

n=4: 10000 - 9k^2 = 1 => 9k^2 = 9999 => k^2 = 1111. Not integer. 

n=5: 100000 - 9k^2 = 1 => 9k^2 = 99999 => k^2 = 11111. Not integer. 

So, seems like for n ≥ 2, k^2 is not integer. But this is just checking small cases. How do we prove it for all n?

But maybe we can use induction or some other method. 

Alternatively, think about the equation 10^n = 9k^2 + 1. Let me take logarithms? Not sure. 

Alternatively, think of 10^n - 1 = 9k^2. Let me factor the left-hand side. 10^n - 1 = (10 - 1)(10^{n-1} + 10^{n-2} + ... + 1) = 9 * N(n). Therefore, 9 * N(n) = 9k^2 => N(n) = k^2. Which is just restating the original problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps think
