 Let $a$ and $b$ be two positive integers, and let $d = \gcd(a, b)$ and $m = \lcm(a, b)$. We want to show that $d$ divides $m$.

Recall that the least common multiple of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers. In other words, $m$ is the smallest number such that there exist integers $x$ and $y$ with $ax = by = m$.

Now, since $d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$, we can write $a = da'$ and $b = db'$ for some integers $a'$ and $b'$. Then, we have $m = ax = by = da'x = db'y$.

Since $d$ is a common divisor of $da'$ and $db'$, we can write $d = d\gcd(a', b')$. Therefore, $d$ divides $m$.

Thus, we have proved that the greatest common divisor of two positive integers divides their least common multiple.
