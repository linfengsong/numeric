Okay, so I need to prove that (3n)! divided by (3!)^n is an integer for all n ≥ 0. Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that factorials grow really quickly, so maybe there's a combinatorial interpretation here? Or perhaps I can use induction? Let me try both approaches.

Starting with induction. Let's check the base case first. When n = 0, (3*0)! / (3!)^0 = 0! / 1 = 1 / 1 = 1, which is an integer. Okay, that works. Now, assume that for some k ≥ 0, (3k)! / (3!)^k is an integer. Then, I need to show that (3(k+1))! / (3!)^{k+1} is also an integer. Let me write that out:

(3(k+1))! / (3!)^{k+1} = (3k + 3)! / (3! * 3!^k) = [ (3k + 3)(3k + 2)(3k + 1)(3k)! ] / (3! * 3!^k )

Which simplifies to [ (3k + 3)(3k + 2)(3k + 1) / 3! ] * [ (3k)! / 3!^k ]

From the induction hypothesis, [ (3k)! / 3!^k ] is an integer. So if I can show that [ (3k + 3)(3k + 2)(3k + 1) / 3! ] is an integer, then the whole expression would be an integer. Let me compute that fraction:

(3k + 3)(3k + 2)(3k + 1) / 6

Let me factor out the 3 from the first term: 3(k + 1)(3k + 2)(3k + 1)/6 = (k + 1)(3k + 2)(3k + 1)/2

Hmm, so now I have (k + 1)(3k + 2)(3k + 1)/2. Is this an integer? Let me check for specific values of k. Let's take k = 0: (1)(2)(1)/2 = 2/2 = 1, which is integer. For k = 1: (2)(5)(4)/2 = 40/2 = 20, integer. For k = 2: 3*7*5 / 2 = 105/2? Wait, 3*7*5 is 105? Wait, 3*7 is 21, 21*5 is 105. 105 divided by 2 is 52.5? Wait, that's not an integer. Wait, hold on, did I do that right?

Wait, when k = 2, (k + 1) is 3, (3k + 2) is 8, (3k + 1) is 7. So 3*8*7 / 2 = 168 / 2 = 84, which is integer. Wait, maybe I miscalculated earlier. Let me check again. For k=2, (3k + 3) = 9, (3k + 2) = 8, (3k + 1) = 7. So 9*8*7 / 6 = 504 / 6 = 84. Which is the same as (k + 1)(3k + 2)(3k + 1)/2 = 3*8*7 / 2 = 168 / 2 = 84. So that works. So maybe my mistake earlier was miscalculating 3k + 2 when k = 2. So that seems okay. So perhaps this expression is always an integer?

But why? Let me think. Let me analyze the expression (k + 1)(3k + 2)(3k + 1)/2. Let me check if this is always an integer. Let me note that 3k + 1 and 3k + 2 are consecutive integers? Wait, 3k + 1 and 3k + 2 are consecutive integers. So one of them is even, so their product is even. Then multiplying by (k + 1), so the entire numerator is (k + 1)*(even number). So the entire numerator is divisible by 2? Wait, but we have divided by 2. So the question is, is (k + 1)*(3k + 1)*(3k + 2) divisible by 2?

Well, since (3k + 1) and (3k + 2) are consecutive integers, one of them is even, so their product is even. Therefore, the entire product (k + 1)*(even number) is divisible by 2. Therefore, dividing by 2 gives an integer. Therefore, the expression is an integer. Therefore, the induction step holds. Therefore, by induction, the original expression is integer for all n ≥ 0. So that seems to work. Wait, but let me check for another value. Let me take k=1. Then (k+1)=2, (3k + 1)=4, (3k + 2)=5. So 2*4*5 / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20. Which is integer. For k=3: (4)*(11)*(10)/2 = 440 / 2 = 220. Which is integer. So seems like it works. Therefore, the induction step is valid. Therefore, the original expression is integer for all n ≥ 0. 

But maybe there's another way to think about this. For example, combinatorial interpretation. Let me think. The expression (3n)! / (3!)^n is the number of ways to divide 3n objects into n groups of 3, where the order of the groups doesn't matter? Wait, no. Wait, if you have 3n objects, and you want to divide them into n groups of 3, then the number of ways is (3n)! divided by (3!^n * n!). Because if the groups are indistinct, you divide by n! as well. But here we have (3n)! / (3!^n). So that would be the number of ways if the groups are labeled. So if you have labeled groups, then it's (3n)! / (3!^n). So that is an integer. So that's a combinatorial interpretation. Therefore, that's an integer. Therefore, the expression is integer. So that's another way to think about it. Therefore, this is the multinomial coefficient. 

Alternatively, think of the multinomial coefficients. The multinomial coefficient for dividing 3n objects into n groups of 3 is (3n)! / (3!^n * n!). But if we don't divide by n! because the groups are labeled, then it's (3n)! / (3!^n). So that would be integer. So that's another way to see it. Therefore, the expression is integer. Therefore, the answer is proved. 

But maybe I should check for n=1. Let me compute (3*1)! / (3!)^1 = 6 / 6 = 1. Which is integer. For n=2: 6! / (6^2) = 720 / 36 = 20. Which is integer. For n=3: 9! / 6^3 = 362880 / 216 = 1680. Which is integer. So yes, seems correct. 

Alternatively, using Legendre's formula to check the exponents of primes in numerator and denominator. Let me think. For each prime p, the exponent in (3n)! is equal to the sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(3n / p^i). The exponent in (3!)^n is n times the exponent in 3! = 6 = 2*3. Therefore, exponent of 2 in denominator is n*1, exponent of 3 is n*1. Therefore, we need to check that for each prime p, the exponent in (3n)! is at least the exponent in (3!)^n. 

So for p=2: exponent in (3n)! is sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(3n / 2^i). The exponent in denominator is n. So need to check that sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(3n / 2^i) ≥ n. Similarly for p=3: exponent in (3n)! is sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(3n / 3^i) and need to check that this is ≥ n. 

Let me check for p=2. Let me compute sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(3n / 2^i). Let me note that floor(3n / 2^i) is the number of multiples of 2^i in 3n. But how does this compare to n? Let me think. For example, for p=2, the exponent in (3n)! is equal to the number of 2s in the prime factorization of (3n)! which is known to be roughly (3n)/2 + (3n)/4 + (3n)/8 + ... which is less than 3n. But the exponent in denominator is n. So we need that the exponent in numerator is at least n. Let me check for specific n. Let me take n=1: exponent in numerator is floor(3/2) + floor(3/4) + ... = 1 + 0 + ... = 1. Which is equal to n=1. For n=2: floor(6/2) + floor(6/4) + floor(6/8) + ... = 3 + 1 + 0 + ... = 4 ≥ 2. For n=3: floor(9/2)=4, floor(9/4)=2, floor(9/8)=1, floor(9/16)=0. Total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 ≥ 3. So seems okay. In general, the exponent of 2 in (3n)! is more than n. Similarly for p=3. Let me check for p=3. The exponent in (3n)! is sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(3n / 3^i) = sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(3n / 3^i) = sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(n / 3^{i-1}) ) = sum_{j=0}^∞ floor(n / 3^j) where j = i - 1. Wait, that's the exponent of 3 in n! multiplied by something? Wait, actually, the exponent of 3 in (3n)! is equal to the exponent of 3 in (n)! multiplied by something? Wait, no. Wait, let me compute sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(3n / 3^i) = floor(3n / 3) + floor(3n / 9) + floor(3n / 27) + ... = floor(n) + floor(n / 3) + floor(n / 9) + ... = n + floor(n / 3) + floor(n / 9) + ... which is equal to the exponent of 3 in (3n)! which is equal to the exponent of 3 in (n)! multiplied by something? Wait, no. Wait, the exponent of 3 in (3n)! is equal to sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(3n / 3^i) = sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(n / 3^{i-1}) ) = sum_{j=0}^∞ floor(n / 3^j) where j = i - 1. Which is exactly the exponent of 3 in n! multiplied by something? Wait, no. Wait, the exponent of 3 in n! is sum_{j=1}^∞ floor(n / 3^j). Therefore, the exponent of 3 in (3n)! is sum_{j=0}^∞ floor(n / 3^j) = floor(n) + sum_{j=1}^∞ floor(n / 3^j) = n + exponent of 3 in n! So the exponent of 3 in (3n)! is n + exponent of 3 in n! Therefore, the exponent of 3 in the denominator is n. Therefore, the exponent of 3 in the numerator is n + exponent of 3 in n! which is certainly greater than or equal to n. Therefore, the exponent of 3 in the numerator is greater than or equal to n. Therefore, for p=3, the exponent in numerator is sufficient. Similarly, for p=2, the exponent in numerator is more than n, as we saw. Therefore, for all primes, the exponents in the numerator are sufficient. Therefore, the expression (3n)! / (3!)^n is integer. 

So that's another way to see it. Therefore, regardless of the approach, whether induction, combinatorial interpretation, or Legendre's formula, the expression is integer. 

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of multinomial coefficients. Let me recall that the multinomial coefficient is (a + b + c)! / (a! b! c!) which is integer. In our case, if we think of dividing 3n objects into n groups of 3, the number of ways is (3n)! / (3!^n * n!) if the groups are indistinct. But if the groups are distinct, then it's (3n)! / (3!^n). Therefore, since the number of ways to divide into distinct groups is an integer, then (3n)! / (3!^n) must be integer. Therefore, that's another proof. 

Alternatively, think of arranging 3n objects into n groups of 3. If the groups are labeled, then the number of ways is (3n)! divided by the permutations within each group, which is 3! for each group, hence 3!^n. So the total number is (3n)! / (3!^n), which must be integer. 

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the expression is integer. 

But just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me check n=0. For n=0, it's 0! / (3!)^0 = 1 / 1 = 1, which is integer. For n=1, 6 / 6 = 1, integer. For n=2, 720 / 36 = 20, integer. For n=3, 362880 / 216 = 1680, integer. For n=4, 12! / (6^4) = 479001600 / 1296 = let me compute that. 479001600 divided by 1296. Let me divide 479001600 by 1296. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 1008? Wait, maybe easier step by step. 1296 = 36 * 36. 479001600 divided by 36 is 13305600. Divided by 36 again is 13305600 / 36 = 369600. So yes, integer. Therefore, seems like all cases are okay. 

Therefore, I think the conclusion is that the expression is indeed an integer for all n ≥ 0. 

But just to make sure, let me think of another approach. Maybe using recursion or some formula. For example, the expression (3n)! / (3!^n) can be written as the product from k=1 to n of (3k)! / (3!^{k}) divided by something? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, think of the expression as the product of combinations. For example, choosing 3 objects out of 3n, then 3 out of 3n - 3, etc. But that would be (3n choose 3) * (3n - 3 choose 3) * ... * (3 choose 3). Which is equal to (3n)! / (3!^n). But each term is an integer, so the product is integer. Therefore, that's another way to see it. 

Yes, because (3n choose 3) is integer, then (3n - 3 choose 3) is integer, etc., so multiplying them all together gives an integer. Therefore, the expression is integer. 

Therefore, multiple methods confirm that the expression is integer. 

So I think that's thorough enough. Therefore, the answer is that (3n)! / (3!)^n is integer for all n ≥ 0.

**Final Answer**
The expression is an integer for all $ n \geq 0 $, so the final answer is \boxed{1} for the base case, but since the question asks to prove it's an integer, the answer is simply confirmed as an integer. However, since the problem asks to prove it's an integer, the final answer is not a numerical value but a statement. However, following instructions, the user might expect a boxed integer, but since it's for all n ≥ 0, perhaps the answer is just confirming it's an integer. But in the original problem, maybe the user expects a specific answer? Wait, the original problem says "Prove that the expression... is an integer for all n ≥ 0." So the answer is just the proof, but in the context of the user's instruction, they might want the final answer boxed. But since the question is to prove it's integer, maybe the answer is just stating that it's integer, but in the format, maybe they expect a box with an integer. But since it's for all n, maybe the answer is not a specific number. Wait, maybe the user is following a template where they have to put the final answer in a box, but since the problem is to prove it's integer, perhaps the answer is simply that it's an integer, but in the absence of specific instructions, maybe the user wants to confirm with an example. But the original problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Since the problem is to prove that it is an integer, maybe the answer is just stating that it's an integer, but in the absence of a specific value, perhaps the answer is \boxed{1} for n=0,
