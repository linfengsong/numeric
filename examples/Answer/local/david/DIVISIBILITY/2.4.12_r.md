 We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the three numbers.

First, we find the gcd of 198 and 288:

$$288 = 1 \cdot 198 + 89$$
$$198 = 2 \cdot 89 + 20$$
$$89 = 4 \cdot 20 + 9$$
$$20 = 2 \cdot 9 + 2$$
$$9 = 4 \cdot 2 + 1$$

So, the gcd of 198 and 288 is 1.

Next, we find the gcd of 1, 288, and 512:

$$512 = 1 \cdot 288 + 224$$
$$288 = 1 \cdot 224 + 64$$
$$224 = 3 \cdot 64 + 32$$
$$64 = 2 \cdot 32 + 0$$

So, the gcd of 1, 288, and 512 is 32.

Now, we can express 32 as a linear combination of 198, 288, and 512:

$$512 = 198 \cdot 2 + 288 \cdot 1 + 32 \cdot (-3)$$
$$288 = 198 \cdot 1 + 32 \cdot 5$$
$$198 = 32 \cdot 6 + 18$$
$$32 = 18 \cdot 1 + 14$$
$$18 = 14 \cdot 1 + 4$$
$$14 = 4 \cdot 3 + 2$$
$$4 = 2 \cdot 2 + 0$$

So, we can express 32 as a linear combination of 198 and 288:

$$32 = 198 \cdot (-1) + 288 \cdot 2$$

Finally, we can express 32 as a linear combination of 198, 288, and 512:

$$32 = 198 \cdot (-1) + 288 \cdot 2 + 512 \cdot 0$$

Therefore, the integers x, y, z satisfying the equation are x = -1, y = 2, and z = 0.
