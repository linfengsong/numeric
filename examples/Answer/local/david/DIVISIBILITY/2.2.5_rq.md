Okay, so I need to prove that for any integer n ≥ 1, the expression n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 is an integer. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that this formula is actually the formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. So, 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. But I need to prove that this expression is an integer. 

Maybe I can use mathematical induction? That's a common method for proving statements about integers. Let me try that. 

Base case: n = 1. Plugging in, we get 1*2*3 /6 = 6/6 = 1, which is an integer. So the base case holds.

Now, the inductive step: Assume that for some integer k ≥ 1, the expression k(k + 1)(2k + 1)/6 is an integer. Then, we need to show that (k + 1)(k + 2)(2(k + 1) + 1)/6 is also an integer. 

Let me compute the expression for n = k + 1:

(k + 1)(k + 2)(2k + 3)/6. 

Hmm, how can I relate this to the expression for k? Maybe expand it and use the inductive hypothesis? Let me try expanding:

First, let me note that the expression for k + 1 is (k + 1)(k + 2)(2k + 3)/6. Let me see if I can express this in terms of the expression for k. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of squares. Since the sum up to k is S(k) = k(k + 1)(2k + 1)/6, then the sum up to k + 1 is S(k + 1) = S(k) + (k + 1)². 

So, S(k + 1) = [k(k + 1)(2k + 1)/6] + (k + 1)². 

Let me compute that:

First, factor out (k + 1):

(k + 1)[k(2k + 1)/6 + (k + 1)]. 

Now, compute the term inside the brackets:

k(2k + 1)/6 + (k + 1) = [k(2k + 1) + 6(k + 1)] / 6

Expanding numerator:

k(2k + 1) + 6k + 6 = 2k² + k + 6k + 6 = 2k² + 7k + 6

Factor that quadratic:

2k² + 7k + 6. Let me check if it factors. The discriminant is 49 - 48 = 1, so roots are [-7 ± 1]/4. That is (-7 + 1)/4 = -6/4 = -3/2 and (-7 -1)/4 = -8/4 = -2. So factors would be (2k + 3)(k + 2). Let me check:

(2k + 3)(k + 2) = 2k(k) + 4k + 3k + 6 = 2k² + 7k + 6. Yes, that's correct. 

So the numerator becomes (2k + 3)(k + 2). Therefore, the entire expression is:

(k + 1)(2k + 3)(k + 2)/6, which is exactly the expression for S(k + 1). 

But since we assumed that S(k) is an integer, then S(k + 1) = S(k) + (k + 1)². Since S(k) is an integer and (k + 1)² is an integer, their sum is also an integer. Therefore, S(k + 1) is an integer. 

Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1. 

But wait, the problem says "prove that n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 is an integer." So maybe induction is a valid approach here. However, maybe there's another way to see why this expression is an integer without using induction? 

Alternatively, perhaps I can show that the numerator is divisible by 6 for all n ≥ 1. Let me think about divisibility. 

Note that 6 = 2 * 3. So if I can show that n(n + 1)(2n + 1) is divisible by both 2 and 3, then it's divisible by 6. 

First, divisibility by 2: Among any two consecutive integers, one is even. So n and n + 1 are consecutive, so one of them is even. Therefore, n(n + 1) is even. Therefore, the entire product n(n + 1)(2n + 1) is even. So divisible by 2. 

Now divisibility by 3. Let me check. 

We need to show that n(n + 1)(2n + 1) is divisible by 3. 

Note that for any integer n, one of n, n + 1, or n + 2 is divisible by 3. But here we have n, n + 1, and 2n + 1. Let me see. 

Alternatively, maybe consider cases based on n mod 3. 

Case 1: n ≡ 0 mod 3. Then n is divisible by 3, so the product is divisible by 3. 

Case 2: n ≡ 1 mod 3. Then n + 1 ≡ 2 mod 3, and 2n + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, 2n + 1 is divisible by 3. 

Case 3: n ≡ 2 mod 3. Then n + 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, n + 1 is divisible by 3. 

Therefore, in all cases, the product n(n + 1)(2n + 1) is divisible by 3. 

Therefore, since it's divisible by both 2 and 3, it's divisible by 6, so n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 is an integer. 

Therefore, the expression is always an integer. 

Wait, but is this correct? Let me check with some examples. 

Take n = 1: 1*2*3 /6 = 6/6 = 1. Integer. 

n = 2: 2*3*5 /6 = 30/6 = 5. Integer. 

n = 3: 3*4*7 /6 = 84/6 = 14. Integer. 

n = 4: 4*5*9 /6 = 180/6 = 30. Integer. 

n = 5: 5*6*11 /6 = 330/6 = 55. Integer. 

Okay, seems to work. 

Alternatively, another way to think about this is that the formula is known to be the sum of squares, and since the sum of squares is an integer, the formula must be an integer. But that's circular reasoning if we don't know the formula. However, if we can prove that the formula is indeed the sum of squares, then we can use that. 

But maybe there's another approach. For example, using modular arithmetic or combinatorial arguments. 

Alternatively, we can think about the expression n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Since n and n + 1 are consecutive integers, one of them is even, so the product n(n + 1) is divisible by 2. Then, to check divisibility by 3, as we did before. 

Alternatively, maybe we can factor the expression. Let me think. 

But perhaps the two methods I have are sufficient. 

Wait, but the problem says "prove that n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 is an integer". So, using the divisibility by 2 and 3 is a solid approach. 

But let me check again the divisibility by 3. Let me think of another way. 

Suppose we consider the three terms n, n + 1, and 2n + 1. 

Note that 2n + 1 ≡ 2n + 1 mod 3. 

But since n ≡ 0, 1, or 2 mod 3, we can check:

If n ≡ 0 mod 3: 2n + 1 ≡ 1 mod 3. So n is divisible by 3. 

If n ≡ 1 mod 3: 2n + 1 ≡ 2*1 + 1 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. So 2n + 1 is divisible by 3. 

If n ≡ 2 mod 3: 2n + 1 ≡ 4 + 1 = 5 ≡ 2 mod 3. Then n + 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. 

Therefore, in each case, one of the three terms is divisible by 3. Therefore, the product is divisible by 3. 

Therefore, since the product is divisible by 2 and 3, it's divisible by 6. Therefore, the expression is integer. 

So that seems solid. 

Alternatively, another approach is to use mathematical induction, which I did earlier. 

But maybe there's also a way to use the concept of binomial coefficients or combinatorial identities. 

Alternatively, think about parity and divisibility. 

But perhaps the two methods I have are sufficient. 

Wait, but the problem says "prove that n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 is an integer". So, if I can show that the numerator is divisible by 6, then done. 

But maybe I can also think about the expression as a combination of terms. 

Alternatively, think about the formula for the sum of squares. If I can prove that the sum of squares is an integer, then the formula must be an integer. However, that's again circular if we don't know the formula. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the formula is known to be the sum of squares, and then argue that the sum of squares is an integer. But that seems like a different approach. 

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that the expression is equal to a combination of binomial coefficients. 

But perhaps the divisibility approach is the simplest. 

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that among three consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 3. Wait, but here we have n, n + 1, and 2n + 1. Not three consecutive numbers, but maybe there's some relation. 

Alternatively, think about parity. 

But I think the divisibility by 2 and 3 is the most straightforward. 

Alternatively, maybe consider that n(n + 1) is always even, so dividing by 2 gives an integer. Then, check if the result is divisible by 3. 

So let me write:

n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = [n(n + 1)/2] * (2n + 1)/3. 

Wait, but not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe split the division into 2 and 3. 

Since n(n + 1) is divisible by 2, then n(n + 1)/2 is integer. Then, we need to show that (n(n + 1)/2) * (2n + 1) is divisible by 3. 

So, if I can show that (n(n + 1)/2) * (2n + 1) is divisible by 3. 

But since n(n + 1)/2 is integer, let me denote that as some integer. 

But perhaps this complicates. 

Alternatively, since we already know that the entire product n(n + 1)(2n + 1) is divisible by 6, then dividing by 6 gives an integer. 

So, given that, maybe the divisibility approach is the simplest. 

Alternatively, think about the formula for the sum of squares. For example, in the case of n=1, 1. For n=2, 1+4=5. For n=3, 1+4+9=14. For n=4, 30. These are all integers. 

But again, that's not a proof. 

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that the formula is a polynomial and check that it's integer for all n. But that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, think about the expression as a combination of binomial coefficients. 

Wait, for example, the formula for the sum of squares can be derived using combinatorial methods. 

But maybe that's too involved. 

Alternatively, think about the expression as a combination of triangular numbers. 

But I think the divisibility approach is the most straightforward. 

So, to recap, since n(n + 1) is divisible by 2, and n(n + 1)(2n + 1) is divisible by 3, then the entire product is divisible by 6, hence the expression is an integer. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that for all n ≥ 1, the expression is an integer. 

Alternatively, maybe use the concept of modular arithmetic to check for divisibility. 

But I think the divisibility by 2 and 3 is sufficient. 

Alternatively, another way to think about divisibility by 3: 

Note that 2n + 1 ≡ 2n + 1 mod 3. 

But n(n + 1)(2n + 1) ≡ 0 mod 3. 

Which is equivalent to n(n + 1)(2n + 1) ≡ 0 mod 3. 

Which is true because, as we saw earlier, one of the factors is divisible by 3. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the product as n(n + 1)(2n + 1) = 2n(n + 1)(n) + n(n + 1). Wait, no, that seems messy. 

Alternatively, think about the product as follows: 

Let me expand n(n + 1)(2n + 1). 

First, multiply n(n + 1) = n² + n. Then multiply by (2n + 1):

(n² + n)(2n + 1) = n²(2n + 1) + n(2n + 1) = 2n³ + n² + 2n² + n = 2n³ + 3n² + n. 

Therefore, the expression is (2n³ + 3n² + n)/6. 

Now, maybe factor this polynomial. 

Let me factor 2n³ + 3n² + n. 

Factor out an n: n(2n² + 3n + 1). 

Then factor 2n² + 3n + 1: 

Looking for two numbers a and b such that a * b = 2 * 1 = 2 and a + b = 3. 

Wait, 2n² + 3n + 1 = 2n² + 2n + n + 1 = 2n(n + 1) + 1(n + 1) = (2n + 1)(n + 1). 

Therefore, 2n³ + 3n² + n = n(2n + 1)(n + 1). 

Which is the same as the original expression. 

So, the expression is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. 

But perhaps this factorization can help us in showing divisibility. 

Alternatively, maybe write the expression as a combination of binomial coefficients or other known integer expressions. 

But perhaps not necessary. 

Alternatively, think about the expression as a combination of terms that are known to be integers. 

Alternatively, think about the expression for n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. 

Since n(n + 1)/2 is the nth triangular number, which is an integer. Then, multiplying by (2n + 1)/3. Wait, but why would that be integer? 

But if we can show that n(n + 1)/2 is divisible by something? 

Alternatively, since we already know that the entire product is divisible by 6, then n(n + 1)/2 * (2n + 1) is divisible by 3. 

But maybe that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, since we have already established divisibility by 2 and 3, perhaps that's sufficient. 

Therefore, combining the two, since the numerator is divisible by 2 and 3, the entire expression is an integer. 

Therefore, the proof is complete. 

But just to make sure, let me check for n = 0. Wait, n ≥ 1, so n = 0 is not considered. 

But if I check n = 0, the expression is 0*1*1 /6 = 0, which is an integer. But the problem starts at n ≥ 1. 

But in any case, the divisibility holds. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a more algebraic approach. 

Another way is to consider that the formula is a cubic polynomial in n, and since it's equal to the sum of squares, which is known to be an integer, then the formula must be an integer. But again, that's circular. 

Alternatively, think about the expression as a combination of known integer sequences. 

Alternatively, use the fact that the expression is the same as the formula for the sum of squares, and since the sum of squares is an integer, the formula is an integer. 

But again, this seems circular. 

Alternatively, think about the expression as a multiple of 1, 2, 3, etc. 

But I think the divisibility approach is the most straightforward. 

So, to summarize:

For any integer n ≥ 1, the expression n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 is an integer because:

1. The product n(n + 1) is divisible by 2, since one of n or n + 1 is even.

2. The product n(n + 1)(2n + 1) is divisible by 3, as shown by considering cases based on n modulo 3.

Since the product is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6, hence the expression is an integer.

Therefore, the proof is complete. 

Alternatively, another approach could be using mathematical induction, as I did earlier, but since the divisibility approach is more straightforward and doesn't require assuming the formula for the sum of squares, that might be preferable. 

But both methods are valid. 

Therefore
