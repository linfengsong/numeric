Okay, so I need to prove that if a is an odd integer, then 24 divides a(a² - 1). The hint says that the square of an odd integer is of the form 8k + 1. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me recall that 24 factors into 8 * 3, so if I can show that 8 divides a(a² - 1) and 3 divides a(a² - 1), then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem or just the property of divisibility, 24 will divide it as well. So maybe I should break this problem into two parts: proving divisibility by 8 and by 3.

Starting with divisibility by 8. The hint says that the square of an odd integer is 8k + 1. Let me check that. Let me take an odd integer a. Any odd integer can be written as 2m + 1 where m is an integer. Let me square that:

(2m + 1)² = 4m² + 4m + 1 = 4m(m + 1) + 1.

Now, m and m + 1 are consecutive integers, so one of them must be even. Therefore, m(m + 1) is even, so 4m(m + 1) is divisible by 8. Therefore, (2m + 1)² = 8k + 1 for some integer k. So that's confirmed. Therefore, a² = 8k + 1. Then, a² - 1 = 8k. Therefore, a² - 1 is divisible by 8. So then, a(a² - 1) would be a * 8k. But wait, but a is odd. So if a is odd, then multiplying by 8k gives us something divisible by 8? Wait, but if a is odd and multiplied by 8k, then yes, the entire product is divisible by 8. Wait, but hold on. Wait, if a is odd and a² - 1 is divisible by 8, then a(a² - 1) is odd * multiple of 8, so that's a multiple of 8. So that would mean that 8 divides a(a² - 1). So that takes care of the divisibility by 8. But maybe I need to check more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about a(a² - 1) as a(a - 1)(a + 1). Since a is odd, then a - 1 and a + 1 are consecutive even numbers. So, for example, if a is odd, then a - 1 and a + 1 are both even. Moreover, since they are two consecutive even numbers, one of them is divisible by 4. Therefore, their product is divisible by 8. Let me check that.

Let me take a as odd. Then, a - 1 and a + 1 are two even numbers. Let me write them as 2k and 2k + 2. Wait, but since they are consecutive even numbers, their difference is 2. So, one of them is divisible by 4. For example, if a is odd, then either a - 1 is divisible by 4 or a + 1 is divisible by 4. Let me check with an example. Let me take a = 3. Then a - 1 = 2, which is 2 mod 4, and a + 1 = 4, which is 0 mod 4. So in this case, a + 1 is divisible by 4. If a = 5, then a - 1 = 4, which is 0 mod 4, and a + 1 = 6, which is 2 mod 4. So again, one of them is divisible by 4. Similarly, for a = 1: a - 1 = 0, which is 0 mod 4, and a + 1 = 2, which is 2 mod 4. So yes, in general, among two consecutive even numbers, one is divisible by 4 and the other is divisible by 2 but not 4. Therefore, their product is divisible by 4 * 2 = 8. Therefore, (a - 1)(a + 1) is divisible by 8. Therefore, since a is an integer, then a(a - 1)(a + 1) is divisible by 8. So that's the divisibility by 8. Therefore, 8 divides a(a² - 1). So that's one part done.

Now, moving on to divisibility by 3. So, I need to show that 3 divides a(a² - 1). Let me think. Since a is an integer, and we are dealing with divisibility by 3. Let me recall that for any integer a, a mod 3 can be 0, 1, or 2. So, let me check the three cases.

Case 1: If a ≡ 0 mod 3. Then, a is divisible by 3, so a(a² - 1) is divisible by 3.

Case 2: If a ≡ 1 mod 3. Then, a² ≡ 1² ≡ 1 mod 3, so a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, a(a² - 1) ≡ 1 * 0 ≡ 0 mod 3.

Case 3: If a ≡ 2 mod 3. Then, a² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3, so again a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, a(a² - 1) ≡ 2 * 0 ≡ 0 mod 3.

Therefore, in all cases, 3 divides a(a² - 1). Therefore, 3 divides the expression. Therefore, since 8 and 3 are coprime (their GCD is 1), then 24 divides a(a² - 1). Therefore, the assertion is proven.

Wait, but let me check if there's a more straightforward way to see this. Alternatively, since a(a² - 1) = a(a - 1)(a + 1). So, this is the product of three consecutive integers. Wait, is it? Wait, if a is an integer, then a - 1, a, a + 1 are three consecutive integers. However, since a is odd, then among these three numbers, one of them is divisible by 3? Wait, not necessarily. Wait, but actually, in any case, for any integer a, the product of three consecutive integers is divisible by 6. But here, we have that the product is divisible by 8 and 3. Wait, but maybe I can think of it as follows:

Since a is odd, then a - 1 and a + 1 are even numbers, as we saw before, and their product is divisible by 8. Also, since among three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3. But here, the three consecutive integers are a - 1, a, a + 1. Therefore, one of them must be divisible by 3. Therefore, the product is divisible by 3. Therefore, the product is divisible by 8 * 3 = 24. Therefore, that's another way to see it. So that's a more general approach. So, regardless of whether a is odd or even, the product of three consecutive integers is divisible by 6. But since a is odd, we have that the product is divisible by 8 as well, so combining these, we get divisibility by 24.

But wait, let me check if that's accurate. For example, take a = 3. Then the product is 2 * 3 * 4 = 24, which is 24. Divided by 24 is 1. So that works. Take a = 5: 4 * 5 * 6 = 120, which is 5 * 24. So that works. Take a = 1: 0 * 1 * 2 = 0, which is divisible by 24. Take a = 7: 6 * 7 * 8 = 336, which is 14 * 24. So that works. So yes, seems like that works. So, since a is odd, then the product of three consecutive integers is divisible by 8 and 3, hence by 24.

But maybe I need to formalize this. Let me think again. Since a is odd, then a - 1 and a + 1 are even. As before, their product is divisible by 8. Also, among three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3. Therefore, the entire product is divisible by 8 * 3 = 24. Therefore, the assertion is proven.

But wait, maybe I should check if the three consecutive integers are indeed a - 1, a, a + 1. Yes, because a is an integer. So regardless of whether a is odd or even, the three consecutive integers are there. However, in the case when a is even, the product would still be divisible by 3, but maybe not by 8. So, for example, if a is even, then a is divisible by 2, and a - 1 and a + 1 are odd. So, in that case, the product would have only one factor of 2, so not divisible by 8. Therefore, the divisibility by 8 is only guaranteed when a is odd. Therefore, combining the divisibility by 8 and 3, we get 24 divides the product when a is odd.

Therefore, the conclusion is that if a is odd, then 24 divides a(a² - 1). Therefore, the assertion is proven.

Alternatively, maybe I can use modular arithmetic to check. Let me try that approach. Since we need to show that 24 divides a(a² - 1), which is equivalent to showing that a(a² - 1) ≡ 0 mod 24. Since 24 = 8 * 3, and 8 and 3 are coprime, we can check congruence modulo 8 and modulo 3.

First, modulo 8. As we saw earlier, since a is odd, a ≡ 1, 3, 5, or 7 mod 8. Let me compute a(a² - 1) mod 8 for each case.

Case 1: a ≡ 1 mod 8. Then, a² ≡ 1² ≡ 1 mod 8. Therefore, a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 8. Therefore, a(a² - 1) ≡ 1 * 0 ≡ 0 mod 8.

Case 2: a ≡ 3 mod 8. Then, a² = 9 ≡ 1 mod 8. Therefore, same as above, a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 8. Therefore, a(a² - 1) ≡ 3 * 0 ≡ 0 mod 8.

Case 3: a ≡ 5 mod 8. Then, a² = 25 ≡ 1 mod 8. Therefore, same result. a(a² - 1) ≡ 5 * 0 ≡ 0 mod 8.

Case 4: a ≡ 7 mod 8. Then, a² = 49 ≡ 1 mod 8. Therefore, same as before. Therefore, a(a² - 1) ≡ 7 * 0 ≡ 0 mod 8.

Therefore, in all cases, a(a² - 1) ≡ 0 mod 8. So that's good.

Now, modulo 3. Let me check a(a² - 1) mod 3. Again, since a is an integer, a can be 0, 1, or 2 mod 3.

Case 1: a ≡ 0 mod 3. Then, a(a² - 1) ≡ 0 * (0 - 1) ≡ 0 * (-1) ≡ 0 mod 3.

Case 2: a ≡ 1 mod 3. Then, a² ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, a(a² - 1) ≡ 1 * 0 ≡ 0 mod 3.

Case 3: a ≡ 2 mod 3. Then, a² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, a(a² - 1) ≡ 2 * 0 ≡ 0 mod 3.

Therefore, in all cases, a(a² - 1) ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, since it is 0 mod 8 and 0 mod 3, then by Chinese Remainder Theorem, it is 0 mod 24. Therefore, 24 divides a(a² - 1). Therefore, the assertion is proven.

Alternatively, another way is to note that a(a² - 1) = a(a - 1)(a + 1). Since a is odd, then among the three consecutive integers a - 1, a, a + 1, one of them is divisible by 3, and as we saw before, the product (a - 1)(a + 1) is divisible by 8. Therefore, the entire product is divisible by 8 * 3 = 24. Therefore, this is another way to see it.

But maybe I can also think about specific factors. For example, since a is odd, then a - 1 and a + 1 are even numbers. So, they are both divisible by 2. Moreover, since they are two apart, one of them is divisible by 4. Therefore, their product is divisible by 2 * 4 = 8. Then, as for divisibility by 3, since among any three consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 3, so one of a - 1, a, a + 1 is divisible by 3. Therefore, the entire product is divisible by 8 * 3 = 24. Therefore, that's another way to see it.

Let me check with an example. Let me take a = 5. Then, a(a² - 1) = 5*(25 - 1) = 5*24 = 120. 120 divided by 24 is 5, which is an integer. So that works. Take a = 7: 7*(49 - 1) = 7*48 = 336. 336 / 24 = 14, which is integer. Take a = 9: 9*(81 - 1) = 9*80 = 720. 720 / 24 = 30. Also integer. Take a = 1: 1*(1 - 1) = 0. 0 divided by 24 is 0, which is integer. So all examples check out.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about prime factors. Since 24 = 2^3 * 3. So, to show that 2^3 divides a(a² - 1) and 3 divides it. For the 2^3 part, as we saw, since a is odd, then a - 1 and a + 1 are even, and their product is divisible by 8. For the 3 part, as we saw, one of the three consecutive numbers is divisible by 3. Therefore, the product is divisible by 3. Hence, the entire product is divisible by 2^3 * 3 = 24.

Therefore, all these approaches lead to the conclusion that 24 divides a(a² - 1) when a is odd. Therefore, the assertion is proven.

But just to make sure, let me think if there's any possible mistake here. For example, could there be a case where even though the product is divisible by 8 and 3, but maybe overlapping factors? For example, if the divisibility by 3 is already accounted for in the divisibility by 8? But since 8 and 3 are coprime, the divisibility by 8 and 3 are independent. Therefore, the LCM of 8 and 3 is 24, so the product must be divisible by 24. Therefore, there's no overlap to worry about. Therefore, the reasoning is solid.

Another way to think about this is to use mathematical induction. Let me try that as well, although the problem might not require it, but just to check.

Base case: Let a = 1. Then, 1*(1 - 1) = 0, which is divisible by 24. So base case holds.

Assume that for some odd integer a = 2k + 1, the statement holds. Then, need to show that for a = 2k + 3, the statement also holds. However, induction might be more complicated here because the expression is not straightforward in terms of k. Alternatively, maybe not necessary. Since we already have multiple proofs, perhaps induction is not needed.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for any odd integer a, a ≡ 1, 3, 5, 7 mod 8. As we checked before, in all these cases, a(a² - 1) is divisible by 8. And for mod 3, as we checked, it's always 0. So that's another way to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe think about the expression a(a² - 1) as a(a - 1)(a + 1). Since a is odd, then a - 1 and a + 1 are even. Let me denote them as 2m and 2n, where m and n are integers. Since a - 1 and a + 1 differ by 2, then m and n differ by 1. Therefore, one of m or n is even, and the other is odd. Therefore, the product (a - 1)(a + 1) = 4mn, where one of m or n is even. Therefore, 4mn is divisible by 8. Therefore, the product (a - 1)(a + 1) is divisible by 8. Therefore, multiplying by a, which is odd, the entire product is divisible by 8. Then, as before, divisibility by 3 is ensured by the three consecutive numbers. Therefore, the entire product is divisible by 24.

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the conclusion is the same. Therefore, I think the assertion is established.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{24}
