 We can rewrite the expression as
$$a^2 + (a+2)^2 + (a+4)^2 + 1 = 3a^2 + 12a + 21.$$
We can factor out a 3 from the first three terms:
$$3(a^2 + 4a + 7).$$
Now, we can use the fact that $a$ is an odd integer. Let $a = 2k + 1$, where $k$ is an integer. Substituting this into the expression, we get:
$$3((2k + 1)^2 + 4(2k + 1) + 7) = 3(4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 8k + 4 + 7) = 3(4k^2 + 12k + 12) = 12(k^2 + 2k + 2).$$
Since $k^2 + 2k + 2$ is an integer, the expression is divisible by 12.
