Okay, so I need to show that for any integer a, the greatest common divisors in parts (a), (b), and (c) are all 1. Let me start with part (a): gcd(2a + 1, 9a + 4) = 1. 

Hmm, I remember that the gcd of two numbers can be found using the Euclidean algorithm. Maybe I can apply that here. The Euclidean algorithm says that gcd(m, n) = gcd(n, m mod n). So let me try applying that to 2a + 1 and 9a + 4.

Let me denote m = 9a + 4 and n = 2a + 1. Then, m mod n would be the remainder when 9a + 4 is divided by 2a + 1. Let me compute that. 

First, let me see how many times 2a + 1 goes into 9a + 4. Let me write 9a + 4 as a multiple of 2a + 1 plus a remainder. Let me think: if I multiply 2a + 1 by 4, I get 8a + 4. Then subtracting that from 9a + 4 gives me (9a + 4) - (8a + 4) = a. So, 9a + 4 = 4*(2a + 1) + a. Therefore, the remainder is a. 

So, gcd(9a + 4, 2a + 1) = gcd(2a + 1, a). Now, let me apply the Euclidean algorithm again to 2a + 1 and a. 

Let me denote m = 2a + 1 and n = a. Then m mod n is (2a + 1) mod a. Since 2a divided by a is 2 with a remainder of 0, so 2a + 1 mod a is 1. Therefore, gcd(2a + 1, a) = gcd(a, 1). 

Now, gcd(a, 1) is 1 because the only positive integer that divides 1 is 1 itself. Therefore, gcd(2a + 1, 9a + 4) = 1. 

Wait, let me check if I did that correctly. Let me verify with a specific example. Let me pick a = 1. Then 2a + 1 = 3 and 9a + 4 = 13. gcd(3,13) is indeed 1. How about a = 2? 2*2 +1=5, 9*2 +4=22. gcd(5,22)=1. Another example, a=3: 7 and 31, gcd is 1. Seems to hold. Maybe I can try a negative number, like a=-1: 2*(-1)+1=-1, 9*(-1)+4=-5. gcd(-1, -5)=1. Yeah, since gcd is always positive. So that seems okay. 

Okay, so part (a) seems done. Now part (b): gcd(5a + 2, 7a + 3) = 1. Let me try the same approach with the Euclidean algorithm. 

Let me denote m = 7a + 3 and n = 5a + 2. Then m mod n is the remainder when 7a + 3 is divided by 5a + 2. Let me compute that. 

Let me see how many times 5a + 2 goes into 7a + 3. Let me try multiplying 5a + 2 by 1: that's 5a + 2. Subtract that from 7a + 3: (7a + 3) - (5a + 2) = 2a + 1. Therefore, 7a + 3 = 1*(5a + 2) + (2a + 1). Therefore, the remainder is 2a + 1. 

Therefore, gcd(7a + 3, 5a + 2) = gcd(5a + 2, 2a + 1). Now, let me apply the Euclidean algorithm again. Let me denote m = 5a + 2 and n = 2a + 1. Then m mod n is (5a + 2) mod (2a + 1). Let me compute that. 

Let me see how many times 2a + 1 goes into 5a + 2. Multiply 2a + 1 by 2: 4a + 2. Subtract that from 5a + 2: (5a + 2) - (4a + 2) = a. Therefore, 5a + 2 = 2*(2a + 1) + a. Therefore, the remainder is a. 

Therefore, gcd(5a + 2, 2a + 1) = gcd(2a + 1, a). Now, similar to part (a). Let me apply the Euclidean algorithm again. Let m = 2a + 1 and n = a. Then m mod n is (2a + 1) mod a = 1, as before. Therefore, gcd(2a + 1, a) = gcd(a, 1) = 1. Therefore, the original gcd is 1. 

Let me check with examples. Take a=1: 5*1 +2=7, 7*1 +3=10. gcd(7,10)=1. a=2: 5*2+2=12, 7*2+3=17. gcd(12,17)=1. a=3: 17 and 24, gcd(17,24)=1. a=0: 2 and 3, gcd=1. a=-1: 5*(-1)+2=-3, 7*(-1)+3=-4. gcd(3,4)=1. Okay, seems to hold. 

So part (b) is done. Now part (c): If a is odd, then gcd(3a, 3a + 2) = 1. 

Hmm, here we have a condition that a is odd. Let me think. Let me denote d = gcd(3a, 3a + 2). Then d divides both 3a and 3a + 2. Therefore, d divides their difference, which is (3a + 2) - 3a = 2. Therefore, d divides 2. Therefore, possible values for d are 1 or 2. 

But since a is odd, let me check if d can be 2. If d divides 3a and d divides 2, then if d=2, then 2 divides 3a. But since a is odd, 3a is 3 times odd, which is odd. Therefore, 3a is odd, so 2 does not divide 3a. Therefore, d cannot be 2. Therefore, the only possibility is d=1. Therefore, gcd(3a, 3a + 2) = 1. 

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check with examples. Let a=1 (odd): 3*1=3, 3*1 +2=5. gcd(3,5)=1. a=3: 9 and 11, gcd=1. a=5: 15 and 17, gcd=1. a=-1: -3 and -1, gcd=1. 

But let me think again. Suppose a is odd, then 3a is odd. Then 3a + 2 is odd + even = odd. So both numbers are odd. Therefore, their gcd must be odd. Since the only divisors of 2 are 1 and 2, and since both numbers are odd, the gcd cannot be 2, so it must be 1. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm here. Let me try that. gcd(3a, 3a + 2) = gcd(3a, 2). Because gcd(m, m + k) = gcd(m, k). So here, m = 3a, and k = 2. Therefore, gcd(3a, 2). Now, since a is odd, 3a is odd. Therefore, gcd(odd, 2) = 1. Therefore, the gcd is 1. 

Yes, that's another way to think about it. So that's straightforward. 

Alternatively, suppose someone doesn't remember that property. Let me try to do it step by step. Let me denote d divides 3a and 3a + 2. Then d divides (3a + 2) - 3a = 2. Therefore, d divides 2. So d is 1 or 2. But since d divides 3a and a is odd, then 3a is odd. Therefore, d cannot be 2. Therefore, d=1. 

Therefore, part (c) is done. 

Wait, let me check for a=1, which is odd. 3a=3, 3a+2=5. gcd is 1. If a is even, say a=2, then 3a=6, 3a+2=8. gcd(6,8)=2. But the question says if a is odd, so even a is not considered here. 

Therefore, all three parts are done. Let me recap:

(a) Used Euclidean algorithm to reduce the gcd to gcd(a,1)=1.

(b) Similarly, reduced to gcd(a,1)=1.

(c) Noted that gcd(3a, 3a+2) divides 2, but since 3a is odd, gcd must be 1.

I think that's solid. Let me check again for part (b) if there's any possible mistake. Suppose someone might think that maybe there's a common divisor. Let me suppose that there exists a prime p dividing both 5a + 2 and 7a + 3. Then p divides their linear combinations. For example, 7a + 3 - (5a + 2) = 2a + 1. Therefore, p divides 2a + 1. Also, since p divides 5a + 2, then p divides 5a + 2 - 2*(2a + 1) = 5a + 2 - 4a - 2 = a. Therefore, p divides a. Then since p divides a and p divides 2a + 1, then p divides 2a + 1 - 2*a = 1. Therefore, p divides 1. Therefore, p=1. Therefore, gcd is 1. So that's another way to see it. 

Similarly for part (a): Suppose d divides 2a + 1 and 9a + 4. Then d divides 9a + 4 - 4*(2a + 1) = 9a + 4 - 8a - 4 = a. Then d divides a and 2a + 1. Therefore, d divides 2a + 1 - 2*a = 1. Therefore, d divides 1. Hence, gcd is 1. 

So that's another way to see it, using linear combinations. 

For part (c), same idea. If d divides 3a and 3a + 2, then d divides 2. Since d divides 3a and a is odd, d cannot be 2. Therefore, d=1. 

Therefore, all parts are proven. 

**Final Answer**

(a) $\boxed{1}$

(b) $\boxed{1}$

(c) $\boxed{1}$

To prove the given statements about the greatest common divisors (gcd), we employ a combination of the **Euclidean algorithm** and **properties of divisibility**. Here's a structured breakdown for each part:

---

### **(a) Show that $ \gcd(2a + 1, 9a + 4) = 1 $**

We apply the **Euclidean algorithm**:

Let:
- $ m = 9a + 4 $
- $ n = 2a + 1 $

Compute:
$$
9a + 4 = 4(2a + 1) + a
$$
So the remainder is $ a $. Then:
$$
\gcd(9a + 4, 2a + 1) = \gcd(2a + 1, a)
$$

Now compute:
$$
2a + 1 = 2a + 1
$$
$$
2a + 1 = 2 \cdot a + 1
$$
So the remainder is $ 1 $. Thus:
$$
\gcd(2a + 1, a) = \gcd(a, 1) = 1
$$

Therefore:
$$
\gcd(2a + 1, 9a + 4) = \boxed{1}
$$

---

### **(b) Show that $ \gcd(5a + 2, 7a + 3) = 1 $**

Again, using the **Euclidean algorithm**:

Let:
- $ m = 7a + 3 $
- $ n = 5a + 2 $

Compute:
$$
7a + 3 = 1(5a + 2) + (2a + 1)
$$
So the remainder is $ 2a + 1 $. Then:
$$
\gcd(7a + 3, 5a + 2) = \gcd(5a + 2, 2a + 1)
$$

Now compute:
$$
5a + 2 = 2(2a + 1) + a
$$
So the remainder is $ a $. Then:
$$
\gcd(5a + 2, 2a + 1) = \gcd(2a + 1, a)
$$

As in part (a), we find:
$$
\gcd(2a + 1, a) = \gcd(a, 1) = 1
$$

Thus:
$$
\gcd(5a + 2, 7a + 3) = \boxed{1}
$$

---

### **(c) If $ a $ is odd, show that $ \gcd(3a, 3a + 2) = 1 $**

Let $ d = \gcd(3a, 3a + 2) $. Then $ d $ divides both $ 3a $ and $ 3a + 2 $, so it divides their difference:
$$
(3a + 2) - 3a = 2
$$
Therefore, $ d \mid 2 $, so $ d \in \{1, 2\} $

But since $ a $ is **odd**, $ 3a $ is also **odd**, and thus $ d $ cannot be 2 (as 2 does not divide an odd number). Therefore:
$$
d = 1
$$

Hence:
$$
\gcd(3a, 3a + 2) = \boxed{1}
$$

---

### **Final Answers**

(a) $ \boxed{1} $  
(b) $ \boxed{1} $  
(c) $ \boxed{1} $
