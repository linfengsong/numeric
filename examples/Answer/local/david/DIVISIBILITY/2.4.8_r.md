 To find the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, we can use the prime factorization method.

1. Find the prime factorization of each number:

- The prime factorization of 143 is $11 \times 13$.
- The prime factorization of 227 is $227$ (since 227 is a prime number).
- The prime factorization of 306 is $2 \times 3 \times 51 = 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 17 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 17$.
- The prime factorization of 657 is $3 \times 219 = 3 \times 3 \times 73 = 3^2 \times 73$.
- The prime factorization of 272 is $2^4 \times 17$.
- The prime factorization of 1479 is $3 \times 493 = 3 \times 17 \times 29 = 3 \times 17 \times 29$.

2. Find the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of each number:

- The LCM of 143 and 227 is $11 \times 13 \times 227 = 3001$.
- The LCM of 306 and 657 is $2 \times 3^2 \times 17 \times 73 = 306 \times 73 = 22338$.
- The LCM of 272 and 1479 is $2^4 \times 3 \times 17 \times 29 = 272 \times 1479 = 400008$.

So, the LCM of 143 and 227 is 3001, the LCM of 306 and 657 is 22338, and the LCM of 272 and 1479 is 400008.
