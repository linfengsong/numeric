Okay, so I need to solve part (a) of this problem, which says that if the triangular number $ t_n $ is a perfect square, then $ t_{4n(n+1)} $ is also a square. Then, part (b) asks to use part (a) to find three examples of squares that are also triangular numbers. Let me start by recalling what triangular numbers are.

Triangular numbers are numbers that can form an equilateral triangle. The formula for the $ n $-th triangular number is $ t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $. So, for example, $ t_1 = 1 $, $ t_2 = 3 $, $ t_3 = 6 $, and so on. 

The problem says that if $ t_n $ is a perfect square, then $ t_{4n(n+1)} $ is also a square. So, given that $ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $ is a square, we need to show that $ \frac{4n(n+1)(4n(n+1) + 1)}{2} $ is a square. Wait, let me write that down properly. 

First, let me write $ t_{4n(n+1)} $. Let me denote $ m = 4n(n+1) $. Then, $ t_m = \frac{m(m+1)}{2} $. So substituting $ m $, we get:

$ t_{4n(n+1)} = \frac{4n(n+1)(4n(n+1) + 1)}{2} $.

Simplify that expression. Let me compute the numerator first:

$ 4n(n+1)(4n(n+1) + 1) $.

Let me compute $ 4n(n+1) + 1 $. Let me compute that term first. Let me denote $ k = 4n(n+1) $, so $ k + 1 = 4n(n+1) + 1 $. So, the entire expression is $ \frac{4n(n+1)(4n(n+1) + 1)}{2} $.

But perhaps I can simplify this expression. Let me see:

First, note that $ 4n(n+1) $ is equal to $ 4n^2 + 4n $. Therefore, $ 4n(n+1) + 1 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 $. Wait, that looks familiar. Let me check:

$ 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = (2n + 1)^2 $. Yes! Because $ (2n + 1)^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 $. Perfect square! So, substituting back, we have:

$ t_{4n(n+1)} = \frac{4n(n+1)(2n + 1)^2}{2} $.

Simplify numerator and denominator. The denominator is 2, so divide numerator by 2:

$ \frac{4n(n+1)}{2} \times (2n + 1)^2 = 2n(n+1) \times (2n + 1)^2 $.

Therefore, $ t_{4n(n+1)} = 2n(n+1)(2n + 1)^2 $.

Now, the problem states that $ t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $ is a perfect square. Let me denote that $ t_n = s^2 $, where $ s $ is some integer. Therefore, $ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = s^2 $. So, $ n(n+1) = 2s^2 $.

So, in the expression for $ t_{4n(n+1)} $, we have $ 2n(n+1)(2n + 1)^2 $. Since $ n(n+1) = 2s^2 $, substituting that into the expression:

$ 2 \times 2s^2 \times (2n + 1)^2 = 4s^2(2n + 1)^2 $.

Which simplifies to $ (2s(2n + 1))^2 $. Therefore, $ t_{4n(n+1)} = [2s(2n + 1)]^2 $, which is clearly a perfect square. Therefore, this proves part (a).

Wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through again:

Starting with $ t_{4n(n+1)} = \frac{4n(n+1)(4n(n+1) + 1)}{2} $. Then, since $ 4n(n+1) + 1 = (2n + 1)^2 $, so substituting that gives $ \frac{4n(n+1)(2n + 1)^2}{2} $. Then, simplifying 4/2 is 2, so we get $ 2n(n+1)(2n + 1)^2 $. Then, since $ t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = s^2 $, then $ n(n+1) = 2s^2 $. Therefore, substituting into the expression for $ t_{4n(n+1)} $, we get $ 2*(2s^2)*(2n + 1)^2 = 4s^2*(2n + 1)^2 $, which is $ (2s(2n + 1))^2 $. Therefore, it's a square. So that seems correct. Therefore, part (a) is proved.

Now, moving on to part (b): Use part (a) to find three examples of squares that are also triangular numbers. 

So, we need to find three numbers that are both triangular numbers and perfect squares. The problem suggests using part (a). So, perhaps we need to find some $ n $ such that $ t_n $ is a square, then use part (a) to generate another square triangular number. But maybe we can use the relationship given in part (a) to generate such numbers. 

Alternatively, maybe we can find the known square triangular numbers and use the formula from part (a). Let me recall that square triangular numbers are numbers that are both square and triangular. The first few are 0, 1, 36, 1225, 41616, etc. But since the problem says "three examples", perhaps we can use the ones that are generated via part (a). 

But first, maybe we need to find some initial square triangular numbers. For example, t_1 = 1, which is 1^2. Then, t_8 = 36, which is 6^2. Then t_49 = 1225, which is 35^2. Then t_288 = 41616, which is 204^2. So, these are known. But how to use part (a) to find them?

Wait, part (a) says that if t_n is a square, then t_{4n(n+1)} is also a square. Therefore, if we have a square triangular number t_n, then t_{4n(n+1)} is also square. Therefore, starting from n=1, which gives t_1=1, then we can compute m = 4*1*(1+1) = 8, so t_8 = 36, which is square. Then, using n=8, compute m = 4*8*(8+1) = 4*8*9 = 288, so t_288 = 41616, which is square. Then, using n=288, compute m = 4*288*(288+1) = 4*288*289, which would give the next square triangular number. Therefore, starting from n=1, we can generate the sequence 1, 36, 41616, etc. So, if we take those, then we can get three examples.

But the problem says "use part (a) to find three examples". So, perhaps we need to show that starting from some known square triangular numbers, we can generate others. However, maybe the problem expects us to find three examples using the relation from part (a). But since the first example is t_1=1, then t_8=36, then t_288=41616. Therefore, these three numbers are square triangular numbers. However, maybe the problem expects three examples, not necessarily generated by this method. But since part (a) is about generating a square triangular number from another square triangular number, then using that, we can get examples. 

Alternatively, maybe we need to find three examples where t_n is square, using the formula from part (a). For example, if we can find n such that t_n is square, then t_{4n(n+1)} is also square. Therefore, the examples would be t_n and t_{4n(n+1)}. However, the problem says "three examples of squares that are also triangular numbers", so maybe we need three numbers that are both square and triangular. 

But since t_1=1 is 1^2, t_8=36 is 6^2, and t_49=1225 is 35^2, but how do we get these using part (a)? Let me check.

Let me take n=1. Since t_1=1 is square. Then, according to part (a), t_{4*1*(1+1)} = t_8
