Okay, so I need to figure out how to prove this version of the Division Algorithm. The standard Division Algorithm says that for integers a and b (with b ≠ 0), there exist unique integers q and r such that a = qb + r, where 0 ≤ r < |b|. But here, the remainder r is supposed to be in the range -½|b| < r ≤ ½|b|. Hmm, that seems different. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, maybe I should recall the standard proof of the Division Algorithm. The usual proof involves considering the quotient q as the floor of a/b, and then the remainder r is a - qb. But here, the remainder is centered around zero, so maybe the quotient is adjusted differently?

Wait, the problem states that r is between -½|b| and ½|b|. So if b is positive, then r is between -b/2 and b/2. If b is negative, then |b| is still positive, so the range would be -|b|/2 < r ≤ |b|/2. But since b is negative, maybe we need to adjust the inequality accordingly? Let me check.

Let me first assume that b is positive. Then the standard remainder is 0 ≤ r < b. But here, we want r to be in (-b/2, b/2]. So, for example, if b = 2, then r would be between -1 and 1. So for a = 3, then q would be 1, r = 1, which is okay. For a = 2, r = 0. For a = 1, r = 1? Wait, no. If a = 1, then with b = 2, we have 1 = 0*2 + 1, so r = 1. But according to the new range, r should be between -1 and 1, so 1 is okay. If a = -1, then we have -1 = (-1)*2 + 1, so r = 1 again? But if we take q = -1, then r = -1 - (-1)*2 = -1 + 2 = 1. But if we wanted r to be negative, maybe we need to adjust q?

Wait, maybe there's a different way to choose q. Let me think. If we have a = qb + r, with r in (-½|b|, ½|b|], then q is not necessarily the floor(a/b). Let me try an example. Let's take a = 3 and b = 2. Then the standard division would have q = 1, r = 1. But if we want r in (-1, 1], then that's okay. If a = -3 and b = 2, then standard division would have q = -2, r = 1 (since -3 = (-2)*2 + 1). But if we want r to be between -1 and 1, then maybe q = -1, r = -3 - (-1)*2 = -3 + 2 = -1. So here, r = -1, which is within (-1, 1]. So in this case, q = -1. So the quotient is different. So maybe the quotient is the nearest integer to a/b, or something like that?

Alternatively, maybe q is floor(a/b + ½) or something? Let me think. Let me try to formalize this.

Let me first consider the case when b is positive. Let me assume b > 0. Then, the standard division algorithm gives us q = floor(a/b), r = a - qb, with 0 ≤ r < b. But we want r to be in (-b/2, b/2]. So if r is in that range, then we can adjust q accordingly.

Suppose that we have a = qb + r, with 0 ≤ r < b. If r is less than b/2, then that's already in the desired range. But if r is greater than or equal to b/2, then we can subtract b from r and add 1 to q. For example, if r = b/2 + k, where 0 ≤ k < b/2, then we can write a = (q + 1)b + (r - b) = (q + 1)b - (b - r). Since r - b = - (b - r), which is between -b/2 and 0. So that would give us a new remainder in (-b/2, 0]. Wait, but the problem states that the upper bound is inclusive. So maybe if r is exactly b/2, then we can have r = b/2, but in standard division, r is less than b. So if b is even, say b = 2, then r can be 1. For example, a = 3, b = 2: r = 1, which is exactly b/2. So that's okay. If a = 4, then r = 0. If a = 5, then q = 2, r = 1. So that's still okay. So maybe the idea is that if the remainder is more than b/2, subtract b and add 1 to q. If the remainder is less than b/2, leave it as is. However, if the remainder is exactly b/2, then we can leave it as is. But if the remainder is negative?

Wait, but in the standard division, the remainder is non-negative. But here, we want the remainder to be in (-b/2, b/2]. So if we have a negative remainder, we can adjust q accordingly. Wait, but maybe we can think of this as taking the nearest integer to a/b, and then adjusting the remainder.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the floor function. Let me think. If we take q = floor(a/b + 1/2). Wait, for example, if a/b is exactly halfway between two integers, then adding 1/2 would make it round to the nearest integer. Let me try with a = -3, b = 2. Then a/b = -1.5. Adding 1/2 gives -1.5 + 0.5 = -1. So floor(-1) = -1. Then q = -1, and r = a - qb = -3 - (-1)*2 = -3 + 2 = -1. Which is within (-1, 1], so that's good. If a = 1, b = 2, then a/b = 0.5. Adding 1/2 gives 1.0, floor(1.0) = 1. Then r = 1 - 1*2 = -1. Wait, that's -1, which is within (-1, 1]. But in this case, if we take q = 0, then r = 1, which is also within (-1, 1]. So there is ambiguity? But the problem says the integers q and r are unique. So how does that work?

Wait, in this case, if a = 1, b = 2. If we take q = 0, then r = 1. If we take q = 1, then r = -1. Both satisfy 1 = 0*2 + 1 and 1 = 1*2 + (-1). But according to the problem statement, there should be unique q and r. Therefore, this suggests that maybe my approach is wrong. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that the remainder r is in (-½|b|, ½|b|]. So for b = 2, that would be (-1, 1]. So both r = 1 and r = -1 are in that interval. So that would mean that there are two different representations? But the problem states that q and r are unique. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my reasoning.

Wait, maybe the problem actually has the remainder in the interval -½|b| < r ≤ ½|b|. So for b = 2, that would be -1 < r ≤ 1. So r = -1 is not allowed, but r = 1 is allowed. Wait, but -½|b| is -1, so the inequality is -1 < r ≤ 1. So r can't be -1, but can be 1. Therefore, in the case of a = 1, b = 2, r = 1 is allowed, but r = -1 is not. Therefore, in that case, the only possible remainder is 1. Therefore, q = 0. But if a = -1, b = 2, then a/b = -0.5. So if we take q = -1, then r = -1 - (-1)*2 = -1 + 2 = 1. But 1 is not in (-1, 1], so that's not allowed. Wait, but if we take q = 0, then r = -1 - 0*2 = -1, which is not in (-1, 1]. Hmm, so this seems like a problem. Wait, but maybe my interval is wrong?

Wait, the problem says -½|b| < r ≤ ½|b|. So for b = 2, that's -1 < r ≤ 1. So r can be 1, but not -1. So if a = -1, b = 2, then we need to find q and r such that -1 = q*2 + r, with -1 < r ≤ 1. Let's try q = -1: then r = -1 - (-1)*2 = -1 + 2 = 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. If q = 0: r = -1 - 0*2 = -1, which is not allowed. If q = -2: r = -1 - (-2)*2 = -1 + 4 = 3, which is not allowed. So only q = -1 gives a valid r. Therefore, in that case, r = 1. So even though r = -1 is not allowed, we can adjust q to make r positive. So maybe in general, we need to adjust q so that r is in that interval.

Therefore, the key idea is that for any a and b, we can find q such that r = a - qb is in (-½|b|, ½|b|]. So how do we find such q?

Alternatively, maybe we can think of q as the nearest integer to a/b. Let me check. For example, if a = 1, b = 2: a/b = 0.5, the nearest integer is 1 or 0. But if we take q = 0, then r = 1, which is allowed. If we take q = 1, then r = -1, which is not allowed. Therefore, maybe q is the floor(a/b + ½). Let me check. For a = 1, b = 2: a/b = 0.5, adding ½ gives 1.0, floor(1.0) = 1. Then r = 1 - 1*2 = -1, which is not allowed. Wait, so that's not working. But if we take q = floor(a/b + ½) or something else?

Wait, maybe q is the nearest integer to a/b, rounding to the nearest integer, with ties rounded to the nearest even integer? But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Let me try to formalize. Let me suppose that b is positive. Let me define q as the integer closest to a/b. If a/b is exactly halfway between two integers, say k + ½, then we need to define q to be either k or k + 1? But in that case, how does that affect the remainder?

Alternatively, maybe we can use the floor function with some adjustment. Let me think. Let me consider the standard division algorithm where r is in [0, b). If I want to adjust it to have r in (-b/2, b/2], then for each a, we can take the standard quotient q and check if the remainder r is in [0, b/2) or [b/2, b). If it is in [0, b/2), then we leave it as is. If it's in [b/2, b), then we subtract b from r and add 1 to q. This way, the new remainder would be in [-b/2, 0). However, the problem states that the upper bound is inclusive. So if the original remainder is exactly b/2, then we can keep it as is. Wait, but in the standard division, r is less than b, so if b is even, then b/2 is an integer. For example, if b = 2, then r can be 1, which is exactly b/2. So in that case, we can leave it as is. If the remainder is more than b/2, then we subtract b and add 1 to q.

So let me formalize this. Let me suppose that b > 0. Let me take the standard quotient q = floor(a/b), and remainder r = a - qb. Then:

- If 0 ≤ r < b/2: keep q and r.

- If b/2 ≤ r < b: set q' = q + 1 and r' = r - b. Then r' = a - (q + 1)b = a - qb - b = r - b. Since r ≥ b/2, then r - b ≥ -b/2. Also, since r < b, then r - b < 0. Therefore, r' ∈ (-b/2, 0). However, the problem states that the remainder should be in (-b/2, b/2]. So r' is in (-b/2, 0), which is within the desired range. However, if r = b/2, then r' = -b/2, which is not in (-b/2, b/2], but rather at the lower bound. Wait, the problem says -½|b| < r ≤ ½|b|. So if b is positive, then it's -b/2 < r ≤ b/2. So r = -b/2 is not allowed, but r = b/2 is allowed. Therefore, in the case when r = b/2, we can keep it as r = b/2. Therefore, we need to adjust the case when r = b/2. But in standard division, r is strictly less than b, so r = b/2 is allowed if b is even?

Wait, for example, if a = b/2, then a = 0*b + b/2. But if b is even, then b/2 is an integer. So in that case, the standard division would have q = 0 and r = b/2, which is allowed. So if we have r = b/2, we can leave it as is. But if r is greater than b/2, then we subtract b and add 1 to q. So in that case, the remainder becomes negative, but it's still within (-b/2, 0). Therefore, in this case, the remainder is in (-b/2, b/2]. So that seems okay.

Therefore, the process would be:

Given a and b > 0:

1. Compute q = floor(a/b).

2. Compute r = a - qb.

3. If r is in [0, b/2), then we are done: q and r.

4. If r is in (b/2, b), then set q = q + 1 and r = r - b.

5. If r = b/2, then we are done: q and r.

But wait, if r = b/2, then in step 3, it's in [0, b/2) only if b/2 is not included. But since the interval is [0, b/2), then r = b/2 is not included. Therefore, we need to check if r is exactly b/2. But in standard division, since r is an integer? Wait, no, r is an integer because a and b are integers. Wait, if b is even, then b/2 is integer. So if a is exactly b/2, then r = b/2 is integer. But if b is odd, then b/2 is not integer, so r cannot be equal to b/2. Therefore, in general, if b is even, then r can be equal to b/2. Otherwise, r cannot be equal to b/2. Therefore, the case when r = b/2 only occurs when b is even and a is a multiple of b/2. So in that case, we can leave it as is.

Therefore, the algorithm would work.

Similarly, if b is negative, we can take absolute value. Let me check. Suppose b is negative. Let me write b = -c where c > 0. Then the equation a = qb + r becomes a = q(-c) + r, which is equivalent to a = -qc + r. Let me rearrange it as a + qc = r. Since r is in (-½|b|, ½|b|] = (-c/2, c/2]. So we need to find integers q and r such that a + qc = r, with -c/2 < r ≤ c/2. So this is similar to the case when b is positive, but with a sign change. So we can apply the same algorithm but with c instead of b. Therefore, if we can solve it for positive b, then we can do the same for negative b by taking absolute value.

Therefore, the overall approach is:

For integers a and b ≠ 0, let c = |b|. Then, perform the division algorithm with c, and adjust q and r accordingly.

But let me formalize this.

Let me consider the case when b > 0 first. Then, as above, we can find q and r such that a = qb + r, with -b/2 < r ≤ b/2. Then, for b < 0, set c = -b > 0, and then solve a = q(-c) + r, which is equivalent to a + qc = r. So we need to find integers q and r such that r = a + qc is in (-c/2, c/2]. So this is equivalent to solving for q and r such that a = -qc + r, with r in (-c/2, c/2]. So if we let q' = -q, then this becomes a = q'c + r, with r in (-c/2, c/2]. Therefore, we can apply the same algorithm as for positive b.

Therefore, the key is to handle the case when b is positive, then adjust for negative b.

Therefore, the problem reduces to proving that for any
