 To show that $n^4 + 4n^2 + 11$ is of the form 16k, we need to find an integer k such that $n^4 + 4n^2 + 11 = 16k$.

Let's start by expanding the expression $n^4 + 4n^2 + 11$:

$n^4 + 4n^2 + 11 = (n^2 + 2)^2 + 7$

Now, let's substitute $n^2 = 2m + 1$ (since n is an odd integer), where m is an integer:

$(n^2 + 2)^2 + 7 = (2m + 1 + 2)^2 + 7 = (2m + 3)^2 + 7$

Expanding the square, we get:

$(2m + 3)^2 + 7 = 4m^2 + 12m + 9 + 7 = 4m^2 + 12m + 16$

Now, we can factor out a 4 from the expression:

$4m^2 + 12m + 16 = 4(m^2 + 3m + 4)$

Let's define $k = m^2 + 3m + 4$. Since m is an integer, k is also an integer.

Therefore, we have shown that $n^4 + 4n^2 + 11 = 4(m^2 + 3m + 4) = 16k$, where k is an integer.

Hence, $n^4 + 4n^2 + 11$ is of the form 16k.
