 To establish the assertion, we need to show that $360$ divides $a^2 (a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)$ for any integer $a$.

First, we can factor $360$ as $2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$. So, we need to show that $2^3$, $3^2$, and $5$ divide $a^2 (a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)$ for any integer $a$.

1. Divisibility by $2^3 = 8$:

We can see that $a^2$ is always even for any integer $a$, because $a^2$ is a perfect square and all perfect squares are even. Therefore, $2^3$ divides $a^2$.

Also, $a^2 - 1$ and $a^2 - 4$ are both odd for any integer $a$. This is because $a^2$ is even, so $a^2 - 1$ and $a^2 - 4$ are both odd. Therefore, $2^3$ divides $(a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)$.

So, $2^3$ divides $a^2 (a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)$.

2. Divisibility by $3^2 = 9$:

We can see that $a^2$ is always a multiple of $9$ for any integer $a$. This is because $a^2$ is a perfect square and all perfect squares are multiples of $9$. Therefore, $3^2$ divides $a^2$.

Also, $a^2 - 1$ and $a^2 - 4$ are both multiples of $9$ for any integer $a$. This is because $a^2$ is a multiple of $9$, so $a^2 - 1$ and $a^2 - 4$ are both multiples of $9$. Therefore, $3^2$ divides $(a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)$.

So, $3^2$ divides $a^2 (a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)$.

3. Divisibility by $5$:

We can see that $a^2$ is always a multiple of $5$ for any integer $a$. This is because $a^2$ is a perfect square and all perfect squares are multiples of $5$. Therefore, $5$ divides $a^2$.

Also, $a^2 - 1$ and $a^2 - 4$ are both multiples of $5$ for any integer $a$. This is because $a^2$ is a multiple of $5$, so $a^2 - 1$ and $a^2 - 4$ are both multiples of $5$. Therefore, $5$ divides $(a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)$.

So, $5$ divides $a^2 (a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)$.

Since $2^3$, $3^2$, and $5$ divide $a^2 (a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)$ for any integer $a$, we can conclude that $360$ divides $a^2 (a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)$ for any integer $a$.
