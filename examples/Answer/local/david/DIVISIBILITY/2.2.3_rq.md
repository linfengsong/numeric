Okay, so I need to use the Division Algorithm to solve these problems. Let me recall what the Division Algorithm says. It states that for any integer a and positive integer b, there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r, where 0 ≤ r < b. So basically, any integer can be expressed as a multiple of another integer plus a remainder. 

Starting with part (a): The square of any integer is either of the form 3k or 3k + 1. 

Hmm. Let me think. If I take any integer n, then according to the Division Algorithm, when I divide n by 3, the remainder can be 0, 1, or 2. So n can be written as 3q, 3q + 1, or 3q + 2 for some integer q. Then, if I square each of these, I can see what forms they take. 

Let me check each case:

Case 1: n = 3q. Then n² = (3q)² = 9q². Which is 3*(3q²), so that's 3k where k = 3q². So that's of the form 3k.

Case 2: n = 3q + 1. Then n² = (3q + 1)² = 9q² + 6q + 1. Let me factor out 3: 3*(3q² + 2q) + 1. So that's 3k + 1 where k = 3q² + 2q. So that's the form 3k + 1.

Case 3: n = 3q + 2. Then n² = (3q + 2)² = 9q² + 12q + 4. Let me see. Let me write 9q² + 12q + 4 as 3*(3q² + 4q) + 4. Wait, but 4 is 3 + 1, so that would be 3*(3q² + 4q + 1) + 1. Wait, let me check that again. 

Wait, 9q² + 12q + 4. Let me factor 3 from the first two terms: 3*(3q² + 4q) + 4. But 4 is 3*1 + 1, so that would be 3*(3q² + 4q + 1) + 1. Therefore, n² = 3k + 1 where k = 3q² + 4q + 1. 

So in this case, it's also of the form 3k + 1. 

Therefore, regardless of what n is, its square is either 3k or 3k + 1. So that proves part (a). 

Wait, let me check with an example. Let me take n = 2. Then n² = 4, which is 3*1 + 1. So that's 3k + 1. If n = 3, then n² = 9, which is 3*3. If n = 4, then 16 is 3*5 + 1. Yeah, that seems to check out. 

Okay, moving on to part (b): The cube of any integer has one of the forms: 9k, 9k + 1, or 9k + 8. 

Hmm. So similar approach. Let me think. Since we're dealing with cubes, maybe I need to consider the possible remainders when dividing by 9? But wait, the Division Algorithm says that when dividing by 3, the remainder is 0, 1, or 2. But here, we need to consider modulo 9? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the problem says to use the Division Algorithm, so maybe we need to consider division by 3 first, then analyze the cube?

Alternatively, maybe we can consider division by 9. Let me think. If I take any integer n, then by Division Algorithm, n can be written as 9q + r, where r is 0, 1, ..., 8. Then, if I cube n, I can compute n³ in terms of r. But that might be tedious, but maybe manageable. However, the problem says to use the Division Algorithm. Maybe it's expecting a different approach. 

Alternatively, since part (a) was about modulo 3, maybe part (b) is about modulo 9? Let me check. Let me think. If I take n modulo 3, then n can be 0, 1, or 2. Then, if I cube n, maybe I can find the possible forms modulo 9?

Wait, but perhaps the Division Algorithm is used in the sense that we can consider n modulo 3 first, then cube it. Let me try that. 

So, for any integer n, n can be written as 3q, 3q + 1, or 3q + 2. Then, cube each of these and see what they are modulo 9. 

Case 1: n = 3q. Then n³ = (3q)³ = 27q³ = 9*(3q³). So that's 9k, which is the first form. 

Case 2: n = 3q + 1. Then n³ = (3q + 1)³. Let me expand that. 

(3q + 1)^3 = 27q³ + 27q² + 9q + 1. Let me factor out 9: 9*(3q³ + 3q² + q) + 1. Therefore, n³ = 9k + 1, which is the second form. 

Case 3: n = 3q + 2. Then n³ = (3q + 2)^3. Let me expand that. 

(3q + 2)^3 = 27q³ + 54q² + 36q + 8. Let me factor out 9: 

First, 27q³ is 9*(3q³), 54q² is 9*(6q²), 36q is 9*(4q), and then +8. So altogether, that's 9*(3q³ + 6q² + 4q) + 8. Therefore, n³ = 9k + 8, which is the third form. 

Therefore, all cubes are either 9k, 9k + 1, or 9k + 8. 

Let me check with examples. Take n = 2: 2³ = 8, which is 9*0 + 8. n = 3: 27 = 9*3. n = 4: 64. 64 divided by 9 is 7*9 = 63, so 64 is 9*7 + 1, which is 9k + 1. Yes, that works. n = 5: 125. 9*13 = 117, 125 - 117 = 8, so 9k + 8. So that's correct. 

So that seems to work. Therefore, part (b) is proven. 

Now part (c): The fourth power of any integer is either of the form 5k or 5k + 1. 

Again, using the Division Algorithm. So similar approach. Let me think. For any integer n, divide by 5, so n can be written as 5q, 5q + 1, 5q + 2, 5q + 3, or 5q + 4. Then compute n^4 for each case and see what they are modulo 5. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the result from part (a) or (b)? Wait, but the problem says to use the Division Algorithm. Let me try the straightforward approach. 

Case 1: n = 5q. Then n^4 = (5q)^4 = 625q^4 = 5*(125q^4). So that's 5k. 

Case 2: n = 5q + 1. Then n^4 = (5q + 1)^4. Let me expand that. 

Alternatively, maybe compute modulo 5. Since (5q + 1)^4 ≡ 1^4 ≡ 1 mod 5. Therefore, n^4 = 5k + 1. 

Similarly for other cases. 

Case 3: n = 5q + 2. Then n^4 ≡ 2^4 mod 5. 2^4 = 16 ≡ 1 mod 5. So n^4 ≡ 1 mod 5. Therefore, n^4 = 5k + 1. 

Case 4: n = 5q + 3. Then n^4 ≡ 3^4 mod 5. 3^4 = 81 ≡ 1 mod 5. Because 81 divided by 5 is 16*5 = 80, so 81 ≡ 1. Therefore, n^4 ≡ 1 mod 5. 

Case 5: n = 5q + 4. Then n^4 ≡ 4^4 mod 5. 4^4 = 256. 256 divided by 5 is 51*5 = 255, so 256 ≡ 1 mod 5. Therefore, n^4 ≡ 1 mod 5. 

Therefore, in all cases, n^4 is either 5k or 5k + 1. 

Wait, but let me check with actual numbers. For example, take n = 2. 2^4 = 16, which is 5*3 + 1. n = 3: 81, which is 5*16 + 1. n = 4: 256, which is 5*51 + 1. n = 1: 1, which is 5*0 + 1. n = 5: 625, which is 5*125. So yes, all of them are either 5k or 5k + 1. 

But wait, why does 2^4, 3^4, etc., all give 1 mod 5? Let me check 2^4 = 16 mod 5 is 1, yes. 3^4 is 81 mod 5 is 1. 4^4 is 256 mod 5 is 1. 1^4 is 1. 0^4 is 0. So yeah, that's because 2^4 ≡ 1, 3^4 ≡ 1, 4^4 ≡ 1 mod 5. 

Wait, but why is that? Because 2^4 = 16 ≡ 1 mod 5. Similarly, 3^4 = (3^2)^2 = 9^2 ≡ 4^2 = 16 ≡ 1 mod 5. Similarly, 4^4 = (4^2)^2 = 16^2 ≡ 1^2 = 1 mod 5. So that's why. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a theorem that says that for numbers not divisible by 5, their fourth powers are congruent to 1 mod 5. But regardless, using the Division Algorithm, we can write n as 5q + r, where r is 0,1,2,3,4, then compute n^4 mod 5. 

But since the problem says to use the Division Algorithm, maybe we need to do the expansion. Let me try expanding for case 3: n = 5q + 2. 

(5q + 2)^4. Let me compute that. 

First, (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4. 

So here, a = 5q, b = 2. 

So (5q)^4 + 4*(5q)^3*2 + 6*(5q)^2*(2)^2 + 4*(5q)*(2)^3 + (2)^4. 

Calculating each term:

First term: 625q^4.

Second term: 4*(125q^3)*2 = 1000q^3.

Third term: 6*(25q^2)*4 = 600q^2.

Fourth term: 4*(5q)*8 = 160q.

Fifth term: 16.

So altogether, n^4 = 625q^4 + 1000q^3 + 600q^2 + 160q + 16. 

Now, let me factor out 5 from each term:

First term: 5*(125q^4).

Second term: 5*(200q^3).

Third term: 5*(120q^2).

Fourth term: 5*(32q).

Fifth term: 16. 

So n^4 = 5*(125q^4 + 200q^3 + 120q^2 + 32q) + 16. 

Now, 16 is 5*3 + 1, so n^4 = 5*(...) + 5*3 + 1 = 5*(...) + 1. Therefore, n^4 = 5k + 1. 

Similarly, for case 5, n = 5q + 4. Let me do that expansion. 

(5q + 4)^4. 

Again, using the binomial expansion:

(5q)^4 + 4*(5q)^3*4 + 6*(5q)^2*(4)^2 + 4*(5q)*(4)^3 + (4)^4.

First term: 625q^4.

Second term: 4*125q^3*4 = 2000q^3.

Third term: 6*25q^2*16 = 2400q^2.

Fourth term: 4*5q*64 = 1280q.

Fifth term: 256.

So n^4 = 625q^4 + 2000q^3 + 2400q^2 + 1280q + 256. 

Factor out 5:

First term: 5*(125q^4).

Second term: 5*(400q^3).

Third term: 5*(480q^2).

Fourth term: 5*(256q).

Fifth term: 256. 

So n^4 = 5*(125q^4 + 400q^3 + 480q^2 + 256q) + 256. 

Now, 256 divided by 5 is 51*5 = 255, so 256 = 5*51 + 1. Therefore, n^4 = 5*(...) + 5*51 + 1 = 5*(...) + 1. Therefore, n^4 = 5k + 1. 

So that's the same as before. 

Similarly, for n = 5q + 3, expanding would give similar results. 

Therefore, regardless of the case, the fourth power is either 5k or 5k + 1. 

Wait, but let me check with n = 5q + 3. Let me compute n^4. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Since we already know that for any integer n, n^4 mod 5 is either 0 or 1. So that's why. 

But regardless, using the Division Algorithm, we can write n as 5q + r, and then compute n^4. 

So, in conclusion, part (c) is also proven. 

Let me check with another example. Take n = 2: 2^4 = 16, which is 5*3 + 1. n = 3: 81, which is 5*16 + 1. n = 4: 256 = 5*51 + 1. n = 5: 625 = 5*125. n = 6: 1296. Let me divide 1296 by 5: 5*259 = 1295, so 1296 = 5*259 + 1. So yes, it's 5k + 1. 

Therefore, all cases covered. 

So, all three parts are proven using the Division Algorithm by considering the possible remainders when dividing by 3, 9, and 5 respectively, and then expanding the powers accordingly. 

**Final Answer**

(a) $\boxed{3k}$ or $\boxed{3k + 1}$

(b) $\boxed{9k}$, $\boxed{9k + 1}$, or $\boxed{9k + 8}$

(c) $\boxed{5k}$ or $\boxed{5k + 1}$

But since the problem asks to put the final answer within boxes, and each part is separate, maybe they expect each part's answer boxed. However, the instructions say "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Maybe for each part, box the conclusion. But since there are multiple answers per part, perhaps list them. 

But the original problem says "establish the following" and each part (a), (b), (c). So for each part, the answer is the forms given. 

But the user might expect each part's answer to be boxed. However, since the user might not have specified, but given the initial problem, perhaps for each part, write the conclusion. 

But looking back, the original instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Maybe the user expects each part's conclusion to be boxed. However, since each part has multiple forms, maybe box each form? But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe for each part, write the answer as the union of the forms. 

But in the original problem statement, the user says "establish the following" and each part has a statement. So for example, part (a) says "The square of any integer
