Okay, so I need to solve these three problems related to triangular numbers. Let me start by recalling what triangular numbers are. Triangular numbers are numbers that can form an equilateral triangle. The nth triangular number is given by the formula T(n) = n(n + 1)/2. For example, T(1) = 1, T(2) = 3, T(3) = 6, T(4) = 10, and so on. 

Starting with part (a): Find two triangular numbers whose sum and difference are also triangular numbers. Hmm. So, I need to find two triangular numbers, say T(a) and T(b), such that T(a) + T(b) and |T(a) - T(b)| are also triangular numbers. 

First, maybe I should list some triangular numbers to see if I can spot any pairs that satisfy this condition. Let me list them out:

T(1) = 1

T(2) = 3

T(3) = 6

T(4) = 10

T(5) = 15

T(6) = 21

T(7) = 28

T(8) = 36

T(9) = 45

T(10) = 55

T(11) = 66

T(12) = 78

T(13) = 91

T(14) = 105

T(15) = 120

T(16) = 136

T(17) = 153

T(18) = 171

T(19) = 190

T(20) = 210

Okay, so let me check pairs. Let me start with smaller numbers. Let's take T(1) = 1 and T(2) = 3. Their sum is 4, which is not triangular. The difference is 2, which is not triangular. So that's no good.

Next, T(1) and T(3): sum is 1 + 6 = 7, not triangular. Difference is 5, not triangular.

T(1) and T(4): sum is 1 + 10 = 11, not triangular. Difference is 9, which is triangular? Wait, T(4) is 10, so difference is 10 - 1 = 9. Is 9 a triangular number? Let me check. T(4) is 10, T(3) is 6, so 9 isn't in the list. Wait, T(4) is 10, so 9 is not triangular. So no.

How about T(2) and T(3): sum is 3 + 6 = 9. Not triangular. Difference is 3, which is triangular. But sum isn't. So that's only one of the two conditions met.

T(2) and T(4): sum is 3 + 10 = 13, not triangular. Difference is 7, not triangular.

T(2) and T(5): sum is 3 + 15 = 18. Is 18 triangular? Let me check. T(5) = 15, T(6) = 21. So 18 is not triangular. Difference is 12, which is not triangular.

T(3) and T(4): sum is 6 + 10 = 16, not triangular. Difference is 4, which is not triangular.

T(3) and T(5): sum is 6 + 15 = 21. T(6) = 21. So that's a triangular number. Difference is 15 - 6 = 9, which is not triangular. So sum is triangular, difference isn't. 

T(3) and T(6): sum is 6 + 21 = 27, not triangular. Difference is 15, which is triangular. So again, only one condition met.

T(4) and T(5): sum is 10 + 15 = 25, not triangular. Difference is 5, not triangular.

T(4) and T(6): sum is 10 + 21 = 31, not triangular. Difference is 11, not triangular.

T(4) and T(7): sum is 10 + 28 = 38, not triangular. Difference is 18, which is not triangular.

T(5) and T(6): sum is 15 + 21 = 36. Is 36 triangular? Let me check. T(8) = 36. Yes! So 36 is triangular. Difference is 21 - 15 = 6, which is T(3). So both sum and difference are triangular numbers. Wait, that seems to satisfy both conditions! Let me check again.

T(5) = 15, T(6) = 21. Their sum is 15 + 21 = 36, which is T(8). Their difference is 21 - 15 = 6, which is T(3). So yes! So that's a valid pair. So part (a) is T(5) and T(6). But let me check if there are other pairs as well.

Wait, but maybe there's another pair. Let me check T(6) and T(7): sum is 21 + 28 = 49. Is 49 triangular? Let's see. T(9) = 45, T(10) = 55, so no. Difference is 7, which is not triangular. 

T(6) and T(8): sum is 21 + 36 = 57, not triangular. Difference is 15, which is triangular. 

T(5) and T(7): sum is 15 + 28 = 43, not triangular. Difference is 13, not triangular.

T(5) and T(8): sum is 15 + 36 = 51, not triangular. Difference is 21, which is triangular.

T(6) and T(9): sum is 21 + 45 = 66. T(11) is 66. So sum is triangular. Difference is 45 - 21 = 24, which is not triangular. 

So that's only one condition. 

Wait, so T(5) and T(6) is a valid pair. Let me check if there are others. Let me check T(1) and T(2) again. No. Maybe higher numbers?

Let me try T(8) and T(10): sum is 36 + 55 = 91. T(13) is 91. So sum is triangular. Difference is 55 - 36 = 19, not triangular. 

T(8) and T(11): sum is 36 + 66 = 102. Not triangular. Difference is 30, not triangular.

T(9) and T(10): sum is 45 + 55 = 100. Not triangular. Difference is 10, which is triangular. 

So difference is triangular, sum isn't. 

T(9) and T(11): sum is 45 + 66 = 111, not triangular. Difference is 21, which is triangular.

T(10) and T(11): sum is 55 + 66 = 121. Is that triangular? Let me check. T(15) is 120, T(16) is 136. 121 is not triangular. Difference is 11, not triangular.

Hmm. So maybe the only pair is T(5) and T(6). Let me check another pair. How about T(0)? Wait, T(0) is 0, but usually triangular numbers start from T(1) = 1. But if we consider T(0) = 0, then maybe?

T(0) = 0, T(1) = 1. Sum is 1, which is triangular. Difference is 1, which is triangular. So that's another pair. But maybe the problem expects positive integers? The question says "triangular numbers", and T(0) is sometimes considered, but maybe not. Let me check the problem statement again. It just says "triangular numbers", so maybe including T(0). However, if we consider that, then T(0) and T(1) would satisfy the conditions. However, I need to check if the problem expects positive integers. Since the question is about "two triangular numbers", and if they allow zero, then that's a possibility. But maybe the answer they are looking for is T(5) and T(6). Let me check if T(0) is considered. 

But in the original problem, part (a) says "two triangular numbers", so if zero is allowed, then that's a possible answer. But maybe the problem expects two distinct triangular numbers? If so, then T(0) and T(1) would be valid. However, maybe the problem is expecting numbers beyond zero. Let me check the problem again. It doesn't specify, so perhaps both answers are possible. However, maybe the problem expects non-zero. Let me think. For example, in the problem statement, part (a
