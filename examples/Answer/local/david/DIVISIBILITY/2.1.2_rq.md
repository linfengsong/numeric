Okay, so I need to prove that the nth triangular number, t_n, is equal to the binomial coefficient (n+1 choose 2) for n ≥ 1. Hmm, let me start by recalling what triangular numbers are. 

Triangular numbers are the numbers that can form an equilateral triangle. The formula I remember for the nth triangular number is t_n = n(n + 1)/2. Let me verify that. For example, the first triangular number is 1, which is 1(1 + 1)/2 = 1. The second is 3, which is 2(2 + 1)/2 = 3. The third is 6, which is 3(3 + 1)/2 = 6. Yeah, that seems right. 

Now, the problem is asking me to express this in terms of binomial coefficients. I know that binomial coefficients are given by the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So, the question is saying that t_n = C(n + 1, 2). Let me check with the examples. For n = 1, C(2, 2) = 1, which matches t_1 = 1. For n = 2, C(3, 2) = 3, which matches t_2 = 3. For n = 3, C(4, 2) = 6, which matches t_3 = 6. Okay, so the formula seems to hold for these cases. 

But I need to prove it in general. Let me write down both expressions. 

t_n = n(n + 1)/2

and 

C(n + 1, 2) = (n + 1)! / [2! (n + 1 - 2)!] = (n + 1)! / [2! (n - 1)!]

Simplify that:

(n + 1)! = (n + 1) * n * (n - 1)! 

So substituting back:

(n + 1) * n * (n - 1)! / [2 * (n - 1)!] 

The (n - 1)! cancels out:

(n + 1) * n / 2 

Which is exactly the formula for t_n. So that shows that t_n = C(n + 1, 2). 

Wait, but is there another way to think about this? Maybe combinatorially? Let me try that approach. 

The binomial coefficient C(n + 1, 2) counts the number of ways to choose 2 items from n + 1 items. How does that relate to triangular numbers? 

Triangular numbers count the number of dots in a triangle with n rows. The first row has 1 dot, the second has 2, ..., the nth row has n dots. So the total number of dots is the sum from k = 1 to n of k, which is t_n. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to model the triangular numbers as combinations. Let me think. 

Suppose we have n + 1 objects, and we want to choose 2 of them. How does that relate to the triangular numbers? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a combinatorial argument. Let me think. If I consider the number of ways to choose 2 numbers from 1 to n + 1. Wait, but the triangular number is the sum of the first n numbers. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a bijection between the pairs of numbers and the triangular numbers. 

Wait, here's an idea. Suppose we think of the triangular number t_n as the number of pairs of integers (i, j) where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. Wait, but that would be C(n, 2). But t_n is n(n + 1)/2. Hmm, that's different. Wait, C(n, 2) is n(n - 1)/2. So that's not the same as t_n. 

Wait, but if we consider the number of pairs (i, j) where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, that would be C(n + 1, 2). Let me check. 

The number of pairs with i ≤ j is equal to the number of combinations with repetition. The formula for that is C(n + 1, 2). Wait, is that right? Let me recall. The formula for combinations with repetition is C(n + k - 1, k). So if we have k = 2, then it's C(n + 1, 2). 

But if we think of the number of pairs (i, j) where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, that's the same as the number of multisets of size 2 from a set of size n. Which is indeed C(n + 2 - 1, 2) = C(n + 1, 2). So that's equal to t_n? Wait, but t_n is n(n + 1)/2. Which is equal to C(n + 1, 2). So that's the same as the formula. 

So, in other words, the triangular number t_n is equal to the number of ways to choose two elements with repetition allowed from a set of size n. Which is C(n + 1, 2). 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Let me think about the triangular numbers as the sum of the first n natural numbers. 

So, t_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. 

But how does that relate to binomial coefficients? Well, I know that the sum of the first n natural numbers can be represented as a combination. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for the sum of the first n numbers in terms of binomial coefficients. Let me recall that the sum from k = 1 to n of k is equal to C(n + 1, 2). 

But how do I prove that? Well, if I use the formula for the binomial coefficient, which we did earlier, we can see that they are the same. 

But maybe there's another way to think about it. Let me think of the binomial coefficients. 

The binomial coefficients also have properties that can be used. For example, C(n, k) + C(n, k + 1) = C(n + 1, k + 1). But I don't know if that's directly helpful here. 

Alternatively, maybe using induction. Let me try that. 

Base case: n = 1. Then t_1 = 1. C(1 + 1, 2) = C(2, 2) = 1. So the base case holds. 

Assume that for some n ≥ 1, t_n = C(n + 1, 2). Then we need to show that t_{n + 1} = C((n + 1) + 1, 2) = C(n + 2, 2). 

But t_{n + 1} = t_n + (n + 1). By the definition of triangular numbers. 

By the induction hypothesis, t_n = C(n + 1, 2). So t_{n + 1} = C(n + 1, 2) + (n + 1). 

Let me compute that:

C(n + 1, 2) + (n + 1) = [ (n + 1)n / 2 ] + (n + 1) = [ (n + 1)n + 2(n + 1) ] / 2 = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 = C(n + 2, 2). 

Which is exactly what we needed. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1. 

So that's another way to prove it. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a direct combinatorial argument. Let me think again. 

Suppose we want to count the number of ways to choose 2 objects from n + 1 objects. That's C(n + 1, 2). But how does that relate to triangular numbers? 

Alternatively, think of the triangular numbers as the number of ways to arrange objects in a triangle. Wait, maybe not. 

Alternatively, think of the triangular number t_n as the number of edges in a complete graph with n + 1 vertices? Wait, no. The number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is C(n, 2). So that's different. 

Wait, but if we have n + 1 vertices, the number of edges is C(n + 1, 2), which is exactly the formula for t_n. Wait, but that's not directly the triangular number. Wait, but if we think of the triangular number as the number of edges in a complete graph with n + 1 vertices, then t_n = C(n + 1, 2). 

But the triangular number is also the sum from 1 to n. So, the sum from 1 to n is equal to the number of edges in a complete graph with n + 1 vertices. 

Is there a way to see that? For example, in a complete graph with n + 1 vertices, each vertex is connected to n others. But each edge is counted twice in that, so total number of edges is (n + 1)*n / 2, which is exactly C(n + 1, 2). 

But how does that relate to triangular numbers? Well, if we think of the triangular number as the number of edges in a complete graph with n + 1 vertices, then t_n = C(n + 1, 2). 

But maybe that's a bit of a stretch. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a direct combinatorial interpretation. Let me think. Suppose we have n + 1 objects.
