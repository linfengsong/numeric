 To prove this, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. We know that any integer can be divided into three categories: those that are divisible by 3, those that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and those that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3.

Let's consider an integer a. There are three possible cases:

1. a is divisible by 3. In this case, the statement is true, as a is one of the numbers that is divisible by 3.

2. a leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. In this case, we can write a as a = 3k + 1, where k is an integer. If we consider the numbers a, a + 2, and a + 4, we can see that a + 2 is divisible by 3, as a + 2 = 3k + 1 + 2 = 3(k + 1), which is divisible by 3.

3. a leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. In this case, we can write a as a = 3k + 2, where k is an integer. If we consider the numbers a, a + 2, and a + 4, we can see that a + 4 is divisible by 3, as a + 4 = 3k + 2 + 4 = 3(k + 2), which is divisible by 3.

In all three cases, we can see that one of the numbers a, a + 2, a + 4 is divisible by 3. Therefore, the statement is true for any integer a.
