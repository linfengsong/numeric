Okay, so I need to show that for a nonzero integer a, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and 0 is the absolute value of a, the gcd of a and a is also the absolute value of a, and the gcd of a and 1 is 1. Hmm, let me recall what gcd means. The greatest common divisor of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. 

Starting with gcd(a, 0). I remember that there's a property in number theory that says gcd(a, 0) is equal to |a|. But why is that? Let me think. Well, any number divides 0 because 0 divided by any non-zero integer is 0 with no remainder. So, for example, if I take a = 5, then 5 divides 0 because 0 = 5 * 0. Similarly, 1 divides 0, 2 divides 0, etc. But the gcd is the greatest such number. Since all positive integers divide 0, the largest one is |a|. Wait, but isn't |a| the largest divisor of itself? Yes, because the divisors of a are all the numbers that divide a, and the largest divisor of a is |a| itself. So, since every divisor of a is also a divisor of 0, the greatest common divisor must be |a|. That makes sense. So, gcd(a, 0) = |a|. 

Now, moving on to gcd(a, a). Well, the gcd of a number with itself should be the number itself, right? Because the divisors of a are the same as the divisors of a, so the greatest common divisor is just the number itself. But again, since we're dealing with absolute values, it's |a|. Let me verify with an example. Let's say a is 6. Then gcd(6, 6) is 6, which is |6|. If a is negative, say -6, then gcd(-6, -6) is still 6, which is |-6|. So yes, it's |a|. 

But maybe I should think about the definition of gcd. The gcd of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both. Since a divides itself, and the divisors of a are all the numbers that divide a, the largest one is |a|. So, that seems to check out. 

Now, the third one: gcd(a, 1) = 1. Well, 1 divides every integer, right? So, 1 divides a and 1 divides 1. Therefore, 1 is a common divisor. Now, is there a larger common divisor? Well, the divisors of 1 are just 1 and -1, but since we take the greatest positive divisor, it's 1. Therefore, the gcd must be 1. Let me think again. Suppose a is any nonzero integer. Then, since 1 divides both a and 1, and the only positive divisors of 1 are 1, so the gcd can't be larger than 1. Therefore, gcd(a, 1) must be 1. 

But maybe I should recall the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm for gcd(a, b) is based on the principle that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b). Let me try applying that. For example, gcd(a, 0). If we use the Euclidean algorithm, we would have gcd(a, 0) = gcd(0, a mod 0). Wait, but division by zero is undefined. Hmm, so maybe there's a special case here. In the Euclidean algorithm, when the second number is zero, the algorithm terminates, and the gcd is the first number. So, in that case, gcd(a, 0) = |a|. That's probably the reasoning. So, that's another way to see it. 

Similarly, for gcd(a, a), applying the Euclidean algorithm would give gcd(a, a) = gcd(a, a mod a). But a mod a is 0, so then it becomes gcd(a, 0) which we already said is |a|. Therefore, that also gives us |a|. 

For gcd(a, 1), applying the Euclidean algorithm would be gcd(a, 1) = gcd(1, a mod 1). But a mod 1 is 0, since any integer divided by 1 leaves remainder 0. Then, it becomes gcd(1, 0) which is |1| = 1. So that also checks out. 

So, all three cases can be verified using the Euclidean algorithm. 

But maybe I should also think about the definition of divisors. Let me recall that the gcd is the greatest common divisor, so it has to divide both numbers. 

For gcd(a, 0): Let's suppose d divides both a and 0. Since d divides a, then d is a divisor of a. Since d divides 0, which is always true for any d. Therefore, the set of common divisors of a and 0 is the set of divisors of a. Therefore, the greatest common divisor is the greatest divisor of a, which is |a|. 

For gcd(a, a): The common divisors of a and a are exactly the divisors of a. Therefore, the greatest common divisor is again |a|. 

For gcd(a, 1): The common divisors of a and 1 are the common divisors of a and 1. Since 1 is only divisible by 1 and -1, and since a is divisible by 1, the common divisors are 1 and -1. Therefore, the greatest common divisor is 1. 

So, all three cases are covered. 

Wait, but maybe I need to be careful with the definition of gcd. Sometimes, gcd is defined as the positive integer, so even if a is negative, the gcd is positive. So, in all cases, we take the absolute value. 

Another way to think about gcd(a, 0): The divisors of 0 are all integers, but since we are talking about positive divisors, the positive divisors of 0 are all positive integers. However, the common divisors of a and 0 are the positive integers that divide a. Therefore, the greatest one is |a|. 

Alternatively, in some textbooks, they define gcd(a, b) as the largest positive integer that divides both a and b. So, if we have gcd(a, 0), since all positive integers divide 0, the largest one that divides a is |a|. 

Similarly, gcd(a, a) is the largest positive integer that divides a, which is |a|. 

For gcd(a, 1), the largest positive integer that divides both a and 1 is 1. 

Therefore, all three statements hold. 

But maybe I should also think about specific examples to verify. 

Take a = 5. 

gcd(5, 0) = 5. 

gcd(5, 5) = 5. 

gcd(5, 1) = 1. 

Similarly, take a = -3. 

gcd(-3, 0) = 3. 

gcd(-3, -3) = 3. 

gcd(-3, 1) = 1. 

Another example, a = 7. 

gcd(7, 0) = 7. 

gcd(7, 7) = 7. 

gcd(7, 1) = 1. 

So, all examples check out. 

But maybe I need to be more formal. Let me try to write the proofs. 

First, gcd(a, 0) = |a|. 

Proof: Letâ€™s recall that the gcd of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both. For any integer a, every integer divides 0. Therefore, the common divisors of a and 0 are exactly the divisors of a. Therefore, the greatest common divisor is the greatest divisor of a, which is |a|. 

Alternatively, using the Euclidean algorithm: gcd(a, 0) = |a|. 

Second, gcd(a, a) = |a|. 

Proof: The greatest common divisor of a number and itself is the number itself. Since the divisors of a are the same as the divisors of a, the greatest common divisor is |a|. 

Third, gcd(a, 1) = 1. 

Proof: Since 1 divides every integer, 1 divides both a and 1. The only positive divisors of 1 are 1 and -1, but since gcd is defined as a positive integer, the greatest common divisor is 1. 

Alternatively, using the Euclidean algorithm: gcd(a, 1) = gcd(1, a mod 1) = gcd(1, 0) = 1. 

So, all three statements are proven. 

But maybe I should also consider the case when a is negative. For example, if a = -4. 

gcd(-4, 0) = |-4| = 4. 

gcd(-4, -4) = |-4| = 4. 

gcd(-4, 1) = 1. 

Which is correct. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of gcd in terms of linear combinations. The gcd of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as ax + by for integers x and y. 

For gcd(a, 0), we can write a = a*1 + 0*any, so the gcd is a, but since gcd is positive, it's |a|. 

Similarly, for gcd(a, a), we can write a = a*1 + a*0, so again, the gcd is |a|. 

For gcd(a, 1), we can write 1 = 1*1 + a*0, so the gcd is 1. 

Therefore, that also works. 

But maybe the linear combination approach is more advanced. However, it's another way to see it. 

Alternatively, in terms of the divisors. 

For gcd(a, 0), since 0 is divisible by any integer, so the common divisors are the divisors of a. The maximum is |a|. 

For gcd(a, a), same as above. 

For gcd(a, 1), common divisors are the divisors of 1, which are only 1 and -1, so maximum is 1. 

Therefore, all three cases are covered. 

I think that's thorough enough. So, the answer is that for a nonzero integer a, gcd(a, 0) = |a|, gcd(a, a) = |a|, and gcd(a, 1) = 1. 

**Final Answer**
For a nonzero integer $ a $, we have $\gcd(a, 0) = |a|$, $\gcd(a, a) = |a|$, and $\gcd(a, 1) = 1$. Therefore, the results are $\boxed{|a|}$, $\boxed{|a|}$, and $\boxed{1}$ respectively.

### **3. $ \gcd(a, 1) = 1 $**

- **Key Insight:** The only positive divisors of 1 are 1 and -1.
- Since 1 divides both $ a $ and 1, it is a common divisor.
- No number greater than 1 can divide 1, so 1 is the **greatest** common divisor.
- Therefore, $ \gcd(a, 1) = 1 $.

### **Verification via Euclidean Algorithm (Optional)**

- **For $ \gcd(a, 0) $:** The Euclidean algorithm terminates when the second number is 0, and the gcd is the absolute value of the first number, i.e., $ \gcd(a, 0) = |a| $.
- **For $ \gcd(a, a) $:** Using the Euclidean algorithm, $ \gcd(a, a) = \gcd(a, 0) = |a| $.
- **For $ \gcd(a, 1) $:** $ \gcd(a, 1) = \gcd(1, a \mod 1) = \gcd(1, 0) = 1 $.

---

### **Conclusion**

For a nonzero integer $ a $, we have:

- $ \gcd(a, 0) = |a| $
- $ \gcd(a, a) = |a| $
- $ \gcd(a, 1) = 1 $
