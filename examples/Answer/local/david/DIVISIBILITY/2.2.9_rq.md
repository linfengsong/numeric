<think>
Okay, so I need to verify that if an integer is both a square and a cube, meaning it's a sixth power, then it must be either of the form 7k or 7k + 1. Hmm, let me think. 

First, let me recall that numbers that are both squares and cubes are called sixth powers because the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. So any number that is both a square and a cube can be written as n^6 for some integer n. So, the problem is essentially saying that any sixth power is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 7. 

Wait, so I need to show that for any integer n, n^6 ≡ 0 or 1 mod 7. Is that true? Let me check with some examples. 

Take n = 0: 0^6 = 0, which is 0 mod 7. That's good. 

n = 1: 1^6 = 1, which is 1 mod 7. 

n = 2: 2^6 = 64. Let me divide 64 by 7: 7*9 = 63, so 64 is 1 mod 7. So 64 ≡ 1 mod 7. 

n = 3: 3^6. Let me compute that. 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^6 = (3^3)^2 = 27^2 = 729. Now divide 729 by 7. Let me compute 7*100 = 700, so 729 - 700 = 29. 29 divided by 7 is 4*7=28, so 29 is 1 mod 7. Therefore, 729 ≡ 1 mod 7. 

n = 4: 4^6. Let me compute 4^2 = 16, 4^3 = 64, 4^6 = (4^3)^2 = 64^2 = 4096. Dividing by 7: Well, 64 is 1 mod 7, so 64^2 is 1^2 = 1 mod 7. Therefore, 4096 ≡ 1 mod 7. 

n = 5: 5^6. Let me compute 5^2 = 25, 5^3 = 125. 125 mod 7: 7*17 = 119, so 125 - 119 = 6, so 5^3 ≡ 6 mod 7. Then 5^6 = (5^3)^2 ≡ 6^2 = 36 ≡ 1 mod 7 (since 35 is 5*7, so 36 is 1 mod 7). 

n = 6: 6^6. Let me compute 6 mod 7 is -1. So (-1)^6 = 1 mod 7. So 6^6 ≡ 1 mod 7. 

n = 7: 7^6 is obviously 0 mod 7. 

So, for n from 0 to 6, the sixth powers mod 7 are either 0 or 1. So that seems to hold. Therefore, if a number is a sixth power, then it is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 7. Therefore, it's either of the form 7k or 7k + 1. 

But wait, let me think again. How do I know that for all integers n, n^6 mod 7 is either 0 or 1? Maybe I should use Fermat's little theorem here. 

Fermat's little theorem says that if p is prime and n is not divisible by p, then n^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p. Here, p = 7, so n^6 ≡ 1 mod 7 if n is not divisible by 7. If n is divisible by 7, then n^6 ≡ 0 mod 7. Therefore, in general, n^6 ≡ 0 or 1 mod 7. 

Yes, that's exactly what we need. So this is a direct application of Fermat's little theorem. Therefore, any sixth power is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 7, so it must be of the form 7k or 7k + 1. 

But let me check if there are any exceptions or if there's a case I missed. For example, suppose n is a multiple of 7, say n = 7m. Then n^6 = (7m)^6 = 7^6 * m^6, which is obviously divisible by 7, so it's 7k. If n is not divisible by 7, then by Fermat's little theorem, n^6 ≡ 1 mod 7, so n^6 = 7k + 1. 

Therefore, all sixth powers are either 7k or 7k + 1. Therefore, the statement is verified. 

But wait, let me check another example. Let me take n = 8. Then 8^6. Well, 8 ≡ 1 mod 7, so 1^6 = 1 mod 7. Therefore, 8^6 ≡ 1 mod 7. So 8^6 is 262144. Let me divide by 7: 7*37449 = 262143, so 262144 is 1 mod 7. Correct. 

Another example: n = 9. 9 ≡ 2 mod 7. 2^6 = 64 ≡ 1 mod 7. So 9^6 is 531441. Divided by 7: 7*75920 = 531440, so 531441 is 1 mod 7. Correct. 

So all these examples check out. Therefore, the conclusion is correct. 

But maybe the problem is expecting a more detailed explanation? Let me think. 

Alternatively, maybe I can check all residues mod 7. Since any integer n mod 7 is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Then compute n^6 mod 7 for each residue. 

Let me do that:

For n ≡ 0 mod 7: 0^6 ≡ 0 mod 7.

n ≡ 1 mod 7: 1^6 = 1 mod 7.

n ≡ 2 mod 7: 2^6 = 64 mod 7. 64 divided by 7 is 9*7=63, so 64-63=1. So 1 mod 7.

n ≡ 3 mod 7: 3^6. Let me compute 3^2=9≡2, 3^3=3^2*3=2*3=6, 3^6=(3^3)^2=6^2=36≡1 mod 7. 

n ≡ 4 mod 7: 4^2=16≡2, 4^3=4^2*4=2*4=8≡1, 4^6=(4^3)^2≡1^2=1 mod 7.

n ≡ 5 mod 7: 5^2=25≡4, 5^3=5^2*5=4*5=20≡6, 5^6=(5^3)^2≡6^2=36≡1 mod 7.

n ≡ 6 mod 7: 6 ≡ -1 mod 7, so (-1)^6=1 mod 7. 

Therefore, for all residues mod 7, n^6 ≡ 0 or 1 mod 7. Therefore, any sixth power is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 7, which means it's either 7k or 7k + 1. 

Therefore, the statement is verified. 

But let me think again if there is any other way this could be approached. Maybe using the fact that sixth powers are squares and cubes, so maybe considering squares mod 7 and cubes mod 7? 

But squares mod 7: Let me check. The squares mod 7 are 0, 1, 2, 4. Let me compute:

0^2=0, 1^2=1, 2^2=4, 3^2=9≡2, 4^2=16≡2, 5^2=25≡4, 6^2=36≡1. So squares mod 7 are 0,1,2,4. 

Cubes mod 7: Let me compute:

0^3=0, 1^3=1, 2^3=8≡1, 3^3=27≡6, 4^3=64≡1, 5^3=125≡6, 6^3=216≡6. So cubes mod 7 are 0,1,6. 

So the intersection of squares and cubes mod 7 would be numbers that are both squares and cubes. So numbers that are sixth powers. So the sixth powers mod 7 are 0,1. Which is the intersection of squares (0,1,2,4) and cubes (0,1,6). So the intersection is 0 and 1. Therefore, sixth powers mod 7 are 0 or 1. Hence, any sixth power is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 7. Therefore, the conclusion follows. 

Therefore, the original statement is correct. 

But let me check if there's a case where a number is both a square and a cube but not congruent to 0 or 1 mod 7. But according to the above, since sixth powers are only 0 or 1 mod 7, there can't be such numbers. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the fact that if a number is a square and cube, then it's a sixth power, and then use modular arithmetic to show that sixth powers are 0 or 1 mod 7. 

So, in conclusion, the answer is that any sixth power is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 7, so it must be of the form 7k or 7k + 1. Therefore, the statement is verified. 

But just to make sure, let me check if there is a case where a number is both a square and a cube, but not a sixth power? Wait, no. If a number is both a square and a cube, then it must be a sixth power. Because the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. So if n is a square, then n = a^2, and if it's also a cube, then a^2 = b^3, so a must be a cube, say a = c^3, so n = (c^3)^2 = c^6. Similarly, if n is a cube, then n = d^3, and since it's a square, d^3 must be a square, so d must be a square, say d = e^2, so n = (e^2)^3 = e^6. Therefore, all numbers that are both squares and cubes are sixth powers. Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that sixth powers are 0 or 1 mod 7, which we have done. 

Therefore, the conclusion is correct. 

I think that's thorough. I considered multiple approaches: examples, Fermat's little theorem, checking all residues mod 7, and also reasoning about squares and cubes. All confirm that sixth powers are either 0 or 1 mod 7. Therefore, the original statement is verified.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{7k} \text{ or } \boxed{7k + 1}
</think>

To verify that any integer which is both a square and a cube (i.e., a **sixth power**) must be of the form $ 7k $ or $ 7k + 1 $, we begin by observing the following:

---

### **Understanding the Problem**

A number that is both a **square** and a **cube** is a **sixth power**. That is, if an integer $ n $ satisfies both $ n = a^2 $ and $ n = b^3 $, then $ n = c^6 $ for some integer $ c $. Therefore, the problem reduces to proving that **any sixth power** is congruent to either $ 0 $ or $ 1 \mod 7 $.

---

### **Using Fermat's Little Theorem**

Fermat’s Little Theorem states that for any integer $ n $ and a prime $ p $, if $ n \not\equiv 0 \mod p $, then:

$$
n^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p
$$

For $ p = 7 $, we have:

$$
n^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \quad \text{if } n \not\equiv 0 \mod 7
$$

If $ n \equiv 0 \mod 7 $, then clearly:

$$
n^6 \equiv 0 \mod 7
$$

Thus, for all integers $ n $, we have:

$$
n^6 \equiv 0 \text{ or } 1 \mod 7
$$

This means that any sixth power is congruent to **either 0 or 1 modulo 7**.

---

### **Interpreting the Result**

If $ n^6 \equiv 0 \mod 7 $, then $ n^6 = 7k $ for some integer $ k $.

If $ n^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7 $, then $ n^6 = 7k + 1 $ for some integer $ k $.

Therefore, any integer that is both a square and a cube (i.e., a sixth power) must be of the form:

$$
\boxed{7k} \text{ or } \boxed{7k + 1}
$$

---

### **Verification via Residues Modulo 7**

To confirm this result, we can compute $ n^6 \mod 7 $ for all residues $ n \mod 7 $:

| $ n \mod 7 $ | $ n^6 \mod 7 $ |
|----------------|------------------|
| 0              | 0                |
| 1              | 1                |
| 2              | 1                |
| 3              | 1                |
| 4              | 1                |
| 5              | 1                |
| 6              | 1                |

This confirms that for all $ n $, $ n^6 \equiv 0 $ or $ 1 \mod 7 $, and thus the sixth power is either of the form $ 7k $ or $ 7k + 1 $.

---

### **Conclusion**

We have shown that any integer that is both a square and a cube (i.e., a sixth power) must be congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 7. Therefore, such a number must be of the form:

$$
\boxed{7k} \text{ or } \boxed{7k + 1}
$$
