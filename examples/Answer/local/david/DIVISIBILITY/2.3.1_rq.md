Okay, so I need to show that if a divides b, then (-a) divides b, a divides (-b), and (-a) divides (-b). Let me start by recalling what it means for one integer to divide another. 

If a divides b, that means there exists some integer k such that b = a * k. Right? So, the definition is that a is a divisor of b if b can be written as a multiple of a. 

Now, the problem is asking about the divisibility of negative numbers. Let me take each part one by one. 

First, show that (-a) divides b. So, if a divides b, then (-a) divides b. Let me think. If b = a * k, then can I write b as (-a) multiplied by some integer? Let's see. If I factor out a negative sign from a, then -a is just -1 times a. So, if b = a * k, then b = (-a) * (-k). Because multiplying -a by -k gives a * k. So, since k is an integer, -k is also an integer. Therefore, b can be written as (-a) multiplied by (-k), which means that (-a) divides b. So that seems straightforward. 

Wait, let me check with an example. Suppose a = 2 and b = 6. Then since 2 divides 6, we can write 6 = 2 * 3. Then (-a) is -2. So, can -2 divide 6? Yes, because 6 = (-2) * (-3), and -3 is an integer. So that works. Similarly, if a is negative, say a = -3, then b would be a multiple of a. Let's say b = -6. Then since a divides b, (-a) is 3. Then can 3 divide -6? Yes, because -6 = 3 * (-2). So that works too. So, seems like the logic holds. 

Okay, moving on to the second part: show that a divides (-b). So, if a divides b, then a divides -b. Let me think. If b = a * k, then -b = -a * k. So, that can be written as a * (-k). Since -k is an integer, that means that -b is a multiple of a. Therefore, a divides -b. 

Again, testing with numbers. Let me take a = 2, b = 6. Then -b is -6. So, 2 divides -6? Yes, because -6 = 2 * (-3). Similarly, if a = -3 and b = 6, then a divides b? Wait, if a is -3, then does -3 divide 6? Yes, because 6 = (-3) * (-2). So then -b is -6. Then does a = -3 divide -6? Yes, because -6 = (-3) * 2. So, that works. 

Third part: show that (-a) divides (-b). So, if a divides b, then (-a) divides (-b). Let me think. Starting from b = a * k, so -b = -a * k. Then, if I want to write -b as (-a) multiplied by some integer. Let me see. -b = -a * k. But (-a) times something equals -a * k. So, if I factor out (-a), then it's (-a) * k. Therefore, that would mean that (-a) divides -b because k is an integer. Wait, but that's the same as the first part? Wait, no. Wait, in the first part, we had that (-a) divides b, which was b = a * k = (-a) * (-k). Now, for (-a) divides (-b), which is -b = -a * k. So, that is (-a) times k. Therefore, yes, since k is an integer, that shows that (-a) divides (-b). 

But maybe I can think of another way. If a divides b, then (-a) divides b, and we already showed that. Then, since (-a) divides b, then by the same logic, (-a) divides -b? Wait, no. Wait, if (-a) divides b, then (-a) divides any multiple of b, including -b. Wait, but is that a valid step? Let me think. If c divides d, then c divides any multiple of d. So, if c divides d, then c divides k*d for any integer k. So, if (-a) divides b, then (-a) divides (-1)*b, which is -b. So, that's another way to see it. 

Alternatively, since we know that (-a) divides b, then we can use the same reasoning as the first part. But maybe that's redundant. 

But let me check with numbers again. Take a = 2, b = 6. Then (-a) is -2, and -b is -6. So, does -2 divide -6? Yes, because -6 = (-2) * 3. Similarly, if a = -3, then (-a) is 3, and -b is -6. So, 3 divides -6? Yes, because -6 = 3 * (-2). So that works. 

So, all three parts seem to hold. Let me try to write them more formally. 

Given that a divides b, so by definition, there exists an integer k such that b = a * k. 

First, to show that (-a) divides b. Let's write b as (-a) * m, where m is an integer. From b = a * k, we can write b = (-a) * (-k). Since -k is an integer, m = -k. Therefore, (-a) divides b. 

Second, to show that a divides -b. Let's write -b as a * n, where n is an integer. From b = a * k, we have -b = a * (-k). Therefore, n = -k, which is an integer, so a divides -b. 

Third, to show that (-a) divides (-b). Let's write -b as (-a) * p, where p is an integer. From b = a * k, then -b = -a * k. Therefore, -b = (-a) * k. So, p = k, which is an integer. Therefore, (-a) divides (-b). 

Alternatively, we can also note that divisibility is preserved under multiplication by units in the integers. Since -1 is a unit (it's invertible), multiplying by -1 doesn't affect divisibility. So, if a divides b, then multiplying both sides by -1 (which is a unit), we have (-a) divides (-b). Wait, but maybe that's a bit more abstract. 

But the key idea is that if you have a divisor relationship, you can multiply both sides by any integer, and the divisibility still holds. Wait, not exactly. Wait, more precisely, if c divides d, then for any integer m, c divides m*d. So, if a divides b, then multiplying both sides by -1 (i.e., m = -1), then a divides -b. Similarly, if we multiply both sides by -1, then (-a) divides b? Wait, let me think. 

If a divides b, then there exists integer k such that b = a * k. Then, multiplying both sides by -1, we get -b = (-a) * k. Therefore, (-a) divides -b. Wait, but that's the third part. So, if we have that, then from this, we can also say that since a divides b, then (-a) divides -b, which is the third part. But then, how do we get the first part? 

Alternatively, if we have that (-a) divides -b, then multiplying both sides by -1, we get that a divides b. Wait, that seems circular. 

But maybe I need to be careful. Let me think again. 

If a divides b, then there exists integer k such that b = a * k. 

Then, for the first part: (-a) divides b. So, we need to show that there exists integer m such that b = (-a) * m. From b = a * k, we can write this as b = (-a) * (-k). So, m = -k, which is integer. Therefore, yes, (-a) divides b. 

For the second part: a divides -b. So, we need to show that there exists integer n such that -b = a * n. From b = a * k, then -b = a * (-k), so n = -k, which is integer. 

Third part: (-a) divides (-b). So, need to show that there exists integer p such that -b = (-a) * p. From b = a * k, then -b = -a * k. Which is (-a) * k. So, p = k, which is integer. 

Therefore, all three are proven by this method. 

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that divisibility is compatible with multiplication by units. Since -1 is a unit (i.e., it's invertible in the integers), multiplying a divisor by a unit doesn't change the divisibility. 

For example, if a divides b, then multiplying both a and b by -1, we get that (-a) divides (-b). But since divisibility is preserved under multiplication by units, that's why. 

But maybe that's more advanced. The problem is likely expecting the basic definition approach. 

Wait, but maybe there's another perspective. If we consider that the set of divisors of a number includes all multiples of that number, positive and negative. So, if a divides b, then all multiples of a (including negative multiples) divide b. 

But perhaps that's not precise. Wait, actually, if a divides b, then the divisors of b include a and -a, and so on. 

But in any case, the key is that multiplying a by -1 doesn't change the fact that it divides b. 

Another thought: if a divides b, then the same holds for -a because the sign doesn't affect the divisibility. For example, if I have 2 divides 6, then -2 divides 6 because 6 divided by -2 is -3, which is integer. Similarly, 2 divides -6 because -6 divided by 2 is -3, which is integer. And -2 divides -6 because -6 divided by -2 is 3, which is integer. 

Therefore, all these cases are covered. 

So, putting it all together, the three statements follow directly from the definition of divisibility and the fact that multiplying by -1 gives an equivalent divisibility condition. 

Wait, but let me check if there are any edge cases. For example, if a is zero? Wait, but the original problem says "if a | b", but if a is zero, then division by zero is undefined. So, I think we can assume that a is not zero. Because in the definition of divisibility, a divides b implies that a ≠ 0. 

So, assuming a ≠ 0, then all the above reasoning holds. 

Another edge case: if b is zero? Well, if a divides 0, then that's always true, because 0 = a * 0. Then, (-a) divides 0, because 0 = (-a) * 0. Similarly, a divides 0, and (-a) divides 0. So, even in that case, all the statements hold. 

Therefore, regardless of whether b is zero or not, as long as a divides b, then all three statements hold. 

So, I think this covers all the cases. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that if a divides b, then (-a) divides b, a divides (-b), and (-a) divides (-b). 

**Final Answer**
The statements are proven, so the final answer is \boxed{(-a) \mid b}, \boxed{a \mid (-b)}, and \boxed{(-a) \mid (-b)}.

To prove the given statements, we begin by recalling the **definition of divisibility** in the integers:

> If $ a \mid b $, then there exists an integer $ k $ such that $ b = a \cdot k $.

This definition is central to our reasoning. Let’s analyze each of the three claims one by one.

---

### **1. If $ a \mid b $, then $ (-a) \mid b $**

We are given that $ a \mid b $, so by definition, there exists an integer $ k $ such that:
$$
b = a \cdot k
$$

We can now rewrite this as:
$$
b = (-a) \cdot (-k)
$$

Since $ -k $ is also an integer, this shows that $ b $ is a multiple of $ -a $. Therefore:
$$
(-a) \mid b
$$

---

### **2. If $ a \mid b $, then $ a \mid (-b) $**

From the given, $ a \mid b $, so there exists an integer $ k $ such that:
$$
b = a \cdot k
$$

Multiplying both sides by $ -1 $, we get:
$$
-b = a \cdot (-k)
$$

Since $ -k $ is an integer, this shows that $ -b $ is also a multiple of $ a $. Therefore:
$$
a \mid (-b)
$$

---

### **3. If $ a \mid b $, then $ (-a) \mid (-b) $**

Again, from the assumption that $ a \mid b $, we have:
$$
b = a \cdot k
$$

Multiplying both sides by $ -1 $, we get:
$$
-b = -a \cdot k
$$

This can be rewritten as:
$$
-b = (-a) \cdot k
$$

Since $ k $ is an integer, this shows that $ -b $ is a multiple of $ -a $. Therefore:
$$
(-a) \mid (-b)
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

By applying the definition of divisibility and manipulating the expressions accordingly, we have shown that all three statements are logically implied by the initial condition $ a \mid b $. These results are consistent with the properties of divisibility in the integers, and they hold for all integers $ a \ne 0 $, since division by zero is undefined.

**Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{(-a) \mid b}, \quad \boxed{a \mid (-b)}, \quad \boxed{(-a) \mid (-b)}
$$
