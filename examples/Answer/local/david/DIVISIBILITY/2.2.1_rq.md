Okay, so I need to prove that for any integers a and b (with b not equal to zero), there exist unique integers q and r such that a = qb + r, where 2b ≤ r < 3b. Hmm, this seems similar to the division algorithm, which usually states that for integers a and b (b ≠ 0), there exist unique integers q and r with 0 ≤ r < |b| such that a = qb + r. But here, instead of the usual remainder range, the remainder r is between 2b and 3b. Interesting. So I need to adjust the division algorithm to fit this different remainder range.

First, let me recall the standard division algorithm. If I have integers a and b (b ≠ 0), then there exist unique integers q and r such that a = qb + r with 0 ≤ r < |b|. The key here is that the remainder is always non-negative and less than the absolute value of b. But in this problem, the remainder is between 2b and 3b. Wait, but that depends on the sign of b. If b is positive, then 2b ≤ r < 3b would mean that r is in that interval. If b is negative, then 2b would be negative and 3b would be more negative. But since r is supposed to be an integer, maybe we need to adjust for the sign of b?

Wait, let me think. The problem says that b is not zero, but doesn't specify whether it's positive or negative. So maybe I should consider both cases? Or maybe there's a way to adjust the standard division algorithm to fit this different remainder range.

Alternatively, maybe I can perform a substitution. Let me think. Suppose I want to write a = qb + r with 2b ≤ r < 3b. Let me consider the standard division algorithm. Let me first assume that b is positive. If b is positive, then 2b ≤ r < 3b. But in the standard division algorithm, the remainder is between 0 and b. So if I want to adjust the remainder to be between 2b and 3b, maybe I need to adjust q and r accordingly?

Alternatively, maybe I can perform a substitution. Let me think. If I let r' = r - 2b, then the condition 2b ≤ r < 3b would translate to 0 ≤ r' < b. So if I can write a = qb + r, then r = r' + 2b. Therefore, substituting back, a = qb + r' + 2b = (q + 2)b + r'. Therefore, if I can write a as (q + 2)b + r', where r' is between 0 and b, then this would satisfy the original equation. But then, this is similar to the standard division algorithm. So if I let q' = q + 2, then a = q'b + r', where 0 ≤ r' < b. Therefore, the existence and uniqueness of q' and r' would imply the existence and uniqueness of q and r. But then, since q' = q + 2, then q = q' - 2. Therefore, the original equation would have unique q and r?

Wait, but this seems like it's assuming that b is positive. Because if b is negative, then 2b ≤ r < 3b would be problematic because if b is negative, then 2b is more negative than 3b. For example, if b = -1, then 2b = -2 and 3b = -3, so the interval would be -2 ≤ r < -3, which is impossible because -2 is greater than -3. Therefore, the interval 2b ≤ r < 3b is empty if b is negative. Therefore, perhaps there's an error here? Wait, maybe the problem assumes that b is positive? Or maybe I need to adjust the interval accordingly?

Wait, the problem statement says "if a and b are integers, with b ≠ 0", so it doesn't specify the sign of b. Therefore, maybe I need to adjust the remainder interval depending on the sign of b. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended for positive b? Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Wait, let me check again. The original problem says "where 2b ≤ r < 3b". If b is positive, then 2b ≤ r < 3b is a valid interval. If b is negative, then 2b ≤ r < 3b would be an interval that goes from a lower bound to a higher bound, but since b is negative, multiplying by 2 and 3 would make the lower bound more negative. For example, if b = -1, then 2b = -2, 3b = -3, so the interval would be -2 ≤ r < -3, which is empty. Therefore, this suggests that the problem might have a typo, or perhaps the original problem assumes that b is positive? Alternatively, maybe the interval is supposed to be 2|b| ≤ r < 3|b|? But the problem states 2b ≤ r < 3b. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended for b positive, and the user just didn't specify? Or maybe the problem is correct, and I need to adjust for both cases. Let me think. If b is positive, then 2b ≤ r < 3b is a valid interval. If b is negative, then 2b ≤ r < 3b would be an empty interval. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering b positive? Or maybe the problem is using a different definition?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different modulus? Wait, in the standard division algorithm, the remainder is between 0 and |b|. So if we want to have a different range, maybe we can adjust the quotient accordingly. Let me try to think.

Suppose we want to write a = qb + r with 2b ≤ r < 3b. Let me consider two cases: b positive and b negative.

Case 1: b > 0. Then, the interval for r is 2b ≤ r < 3b. Let me think about how to adjust the standard division algorithm. Let me consider dividing a by b, but shifting the remainder. Let me think. Let me suppose that we can write a = q*b + r, where 0 ≤ r < b. Then, if I want to shift the remainder to be between 2b and 3b, I can write r = r' + 2b, where 0 ≤ r' < b. Then, substituting back, a = q*b + r' + 2b = (q + 2)*b + r'. Therefore, if I set q' = q + 2, then a = q'*b + r', where 0 ≤ r' < b. Therefore, since the standard division algorithm gives unique q and r, then this would give unique q' and r', hence unique q and r. Therefore, for b positive, this works. Therefore, for b positive, we can find such q and r.

But what if b is negative? Let me check. Suppose b is negative, say b = -k where k is a positive integer. Then, the condition is 2b ≤ r < 3b, which is 2*(-k) ≤ r < 3*(-k), so -2k ≤ r < -3k. But since k is positive, -2k is greater than -3k, so the interval is from -2k to -3k, which is empty. Therefore, there are no integers r satisfying that inequality. Therefore, this suggests that the problem might have an issue when b is negative. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that b is positive? Or maybe there is a mistake in the problem statement?

Alternatively, maybe the original problem intended the interval to be 2|b| ≤ r < 3|b|? Then, regardless of the sign of b, it would make sense. For example, if b is positive, then 2b ≤ r < 3b; if b is negative, then 2|b| = -2b, so the interval would be -2b ≤ r < -3b. Wait, but if b is negative, then -2b is positive, and -3b is also positive. So if b is negative, say b = -k, then 2|b| = 2k, and 3|b| = 3k, so the interval would be 2k ≤ r < 3k. But since b is negative, and we are writing a = qb + r, then if we have r between 2k and 3k, but b is negative. Let me check with an example.

Suppose b = -1, then 2|b| = 2, 3|b| = 3. So the interval is 2 ≤ r < 3. Since r is an integer, the only possible value is r = 2. Then, a = q*(-1) + 2. Therefore, for example, if a = 5, then 5 = -q + 2 => q = -3. Then, 5 = (-3)*(-1) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5. That works. So if we adjust the interval to 2|b| ≤ r < 3|b|, then regardless of the sign of b, the interval is valid. However, the problem states 2b ≤ r < 3b, which would not be valid for negative b. Therefore, maybe the problem has a typo? Or maybe the original problem assumes that b is positive?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to consider that when b is negative, the remainder is adjusted accordingly. Wait, but if b is negative, then 2b ≤ r < 3b is an empty interval, so there are no solutions. Therefore, this suggests that the problem is only valid for positive b. Therefore, maybe the problem assumes that b is positive? Or maybe there's another way to interpret it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the context of a specific modulus or something else. Wait, maybe the problem is using a different definition of the remainder. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I can adjust the quotient and remainder accordingly. Suppose I want to write a = qb + r with 2b ≤ r < 3b. Let me consider dividing a by b, but adjusting the quotient so that the remainder falls into that interval.

Let me think of the standard division algorithm. Let me write a = q*b + r, where 0 ≤ r < |b|. If I want to shift the remainder, I can adjust the quotient. Let me suppose that b is positive. Then, if I take the standard remainder r, and I want to have r' = r + 2b, then r' would be between 2b and 3b. But then, since r < b, r' < b + 2b = 3b. Also, since r ≥ 0, r' ≥ 2b. Therefore, if I set q' = q + 2, then a = q'*b + r', where 2b ≤ r' < 3b. Therefore, this gives the required representation. Therefore, for positive b, this works. However, if b is negative, then the standard division algorithm would have 0 ≤ r < |b|. Let me take b negative, say b = -k where k is positive. Then, the standard division algorithm would give a = q*(-k) + r, where 0 ≤ r < k. If I want to write a = q'*b + r', where 2b ≤ r' < 3b. Since b is negative, 2b = -2k and 3b = -3k. Therefore, the interval is -2k ≤ r' < -3k. But since k is positive, -2k is greater than -3k, so this interval is empty. Therefore, there are no such integers r' in that interval. Therefore, the problem is invalid for negative b? Therefore, maybe the problem assumes that b is positive? Or perhaps the original problem had absolute values?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, but I need to adjust the remainder for negative b. Let me think. Suppose b is negative. Let me write b = -k where k is a positive integer. Then, the condition is 2b ≤ r < 3b, which is -2k ≤ r < -3k. But since k is positive, this interval is from -2k to -3k, which is empty. Therefore, there are no integers r in that interval. Therefore, the problem cannot be solved for negative b. Therefore, maybe the problem is intended for positive b? Or perhaps the original problem had a different interval?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different definition of the remainder, such as in modular arithmetic? For example, if we consider modulo 3b - 2b = b. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to define a different kind of division with a different remainder range. However, given that for negative b the interval is empty, the problem might have an error.

Alternatively, maybe the original problem had 0 ≤ r < b, but the user mistyped it? Or maybe the interval is supposed to be 2b < r ≤ 3b? Let me check. If the interval was 2b < r ≤ 3b, then for b negative, 2b < r ≤ 3b would be -2k < r ≤ -3k, which is also empty. So that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe the interval is supposed to be -2b ≤ r < -3b? For b positive, that would be -2b ≤ r < -3b, which is empty. For b negative, say b = -k, then -2b = 2k and -3b = 3k, so 2k ≤ r < 3k, which is valid. Therefore, if the interval was -2b ≤ r < -3b, then for b positive, it's empty, and for b negative, it's valid. Therefore, maybe the problem has a typo, and the interval is supposed to be -2b ≤ r < -3b? But the problem says 2b ≤ r < 3b. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that when b is negative, I can adjust the quotient and remainder accordingly. Let me try. Let me suppose that b is negative. Let me write b = -k, where k is a positive integer. Then, the original equation is a = q*(-k) + r, with 2*(-k) ≤ r < 3*(-k), which is -2k ≤ r < -3k. However, since k is positive, -2k is greater than -3k. Therefore, the interval is from -2k to -3k, which is empty. Therefore, there are no integers r in that interval. Therefore, this suggests that the problem is invalid for negative b. Therefore, maybe the problem is only considering positive b? If that's the case, then I can proceed under the assumption that b is positive.

Therefore, assuming that b is positive, let me proceed. So, given that, we can use the standard division algorithm. Let me recall that for integers a and b (b > 0), there exist unique integers q and r such that a = qb + r with 0 ≤ r < b. Therefore, if I want to have r in [2b, 3b), then I can take the standard remainder r and add 2b to it. Therefore, let me define r' = r + 2b. Then, since 0 ≤ r < b, adding 2b gives 2b ≤ r' < 3b. Therefore, substituting back into the equation, a = qb + r = qb + r' - 2b = (q - 2)b + r'. Therefore, if I set q' = q - 2, then a = q'*b + r', where 2b ≤ r' < 3b. Therefore, this gives us the desired representation. However, here q' = q - 2, so the quotient is adjusted. But since the original q is unique, then q' is also unique. Therefore, this shows the existence and uniqueness of q' and r', hence of q and r.

Wait, but in this case, if we take r' = r + 2b, then we need to make sure that r' is still an integer, which it is, since r and b are integers. Therefore, this seems valid. Therefore, for positive b, we can find such q and r. However, the problem states that the remainder is between 2b and 3b, which for positive b is valid. Therefore, this seems to work.

But then, uniqueness? Let me check. Suppose there are two different pairs (q, r) and (q', r') such that a = qb + r = q'b + r', with 2b ≤ r, r' < 3b. Then, subtracting the two equations, we have (q - q')b = r' - r. Since r and r' are in [2b, 3b), their difference r' - r is between -b and b. Therefore, (q - q')b is between -b and b. Therefore, (q - q')b must be an integer multiple of b, but since the difference is between -b and b, the only possibility is that (q - q')b = 0, hence q - q' = 0, so q = q', and then r = r'. Therefore, uniqueness is preserved. Therefore, the representation is unique.

Therefore, for positive b, this works. However, the problem didn't specify that b is positive. Therefore, if we assume that b is positive, then the proof is valid. But if b is negative, the problem is invalid. However, since the problem says b ≠ 0, maybe it's intended that b is positive? Or maybe the original problem had absolute values? Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to adjust for negative b.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose b is negative. Let me take b = -k where k is a positive integer. Then, the original equation is a = q*(-k) + r, with 2*(-k) ≤ r < 3*(-k), which is -2k ≤ r < -3k. But since k is positive, this interval is from -2k to -3k, which is empty. Therefore, no solutions. Therefore, the problem is only valid when b is positive. Therefore, maybe the problem assumes that b is positive? Or maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the context of a specific modulus or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different kind of division. For example, if we consider the division algorithm with a different modulus. Wait, but I need to stick to the problem as
