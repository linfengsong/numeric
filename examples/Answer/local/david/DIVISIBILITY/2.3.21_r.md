 (a) We are given that $d | n$, which means that $n = d \cdot k$ for some integer $k$. We want to show that $2^d - 1 | 2^n - 1$.

We can rewrite $2^n - 1$ as $2^{d \cdot k} - 1$. Using the property of exponents, we can rewrite this as $(2^d)^k - 1$. Now, we can factor this expression using the difference of squares formula: $(2^d)^k - 1 = (2^d - 1)((2^d)^{k-1} + (2^d)^{k-2} + \dots + 1)$.

Since $2^d - 1$ is a factor of $(2^d)^k - 1$, we have shown that $2^d - 1 | 2^n - 1$.

(b) To verify that $2^{35} - 1$ is divisible by 31 and 127, we can use the result from part (a). We know that $2^5 - 1 = 31$ and $2^7 - 1 = 127$. Since $35 = 5 \cdot 7$, we can apply the result from part (a) with $d = 5$ and $n = 35$. This gives us $2^5 - 1 | 2^{35} - 1$, which means that $31 | 2^{35} - 1$.

Similarly, with $d = 7$ and $n = 35$, we have $2^7 - 1 | 2^{35} - 1$, which means that $127 | 2^{35} - 1$.

Therefore, $2^{35} - 1$ is divisible by both 31 and 127.
