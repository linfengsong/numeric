Okay, so I need to show that for any integer n ≥ 1, the expression n(7n² + 5) is divisible by 6. That means when I compute n(7n² + 5), the result should be a multiple of 6. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that if a number is divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3. So maybe I can check divisibility by 2 and 3 separately. If I can show that the expression is divisible by both 2 and 3, then it must be divisible by 6. That seems like a good plan.

Let me start with divisibility by 2. For the expression n(7n² + 5) to be even, either n is even or 7n² + 5 is even. Let me check both cases.

Case 1: n is even. If n is even, then n is divisible by 2, so the entire expression n(...) will be divisible by 2. That's straightforward.

Case 2: n is odd. If n is odd, then let's see what 7n² + 5 is. Since n is odd, n² is also odd (because odd times odd is odd). Then 7 times an odd number is odd (since 7 is odd, odd*odd=odd). Then adding 5 to that: odd + odd = even. So 7n² + 5 is even when n is odd. Therefore, if n is odd, the second factor is even, so the entire expression is even. 

So regardless of whether n is even or odd, the expression n(7n² + 5) is even. Therefore, it is divisible by 2. Good, that takes care of divisibility by 2.

Now, moving on to divisibility by 3. For the expression to be divisible by 3, either n is divisible by 3, or 7n² + 5 is divisible by 3. Let me check both possibilities.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the expression modulo 3. Let me try that approach. Let me compute n(7n² + 5) mod 3. Let me simplify the coefficients modulo 3 first.

Note that 7 ≡ 1 mod 3 (since 7 - 6 = 1), and 5 ≡ 2 mod 3 (since 5 - 3 = 2). Therefore, the expression becomes:

n(1*n² + 2) mod 3 = n(n² + 2) mod 3.

So we need to show that n(n² + 2) ≡ 0 mod 3 for any integer n.

Alternatively, maybe I can analyze this expression for n modulo 3. Since modulo 3, n can be 0, 1, or 2. Let me check each case.

Case 1: n ≡ 0 mod 3. Then n is divisible by 3, so the entire expression is 0 mod 3. So that's good.

Case 2: n ≡ 1 mod 3. Then n² ≡ 1² ≡ 1 mod 3. Then n² + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, the expression becomes n*(0) ≡ 0 mod 3. So that's also good.

Case 3: n ≡ 2 mod 3. Then n² ≡ (2)² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Then n² + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 ≡ 0 mod 3. So again, the expression is n*(0) ≡ 0 mod 3. 

So in all cases, the expression is congruent to 0 modulo 3. Therefore, the expression is divisible by 3.

Since we've shown that the expression is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by 6. Therefore, n(7n² + 5) is of the form 6k for some integer k. 

Wait, let me check with some examples to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Take n=1: 1*(7*1 +5)=1*(7+5)=12. 12 is 6*2, so yes.

n=2: 2*(7*4 +5)=2*(28 +5)=2*33=66. 66 is 6*11, correct.

n=3: 3*(7*9 +5)=3*(63 +5)=3*68=204. 204 divided by 6 is 34, so yes.

n=4: 4*(7*16 +5)=4*(112 +5)=4*117=468. 468 divided by 6 is 78. Correct.

n=5: 5*(7*25 +5)=5*(175 +5)=5*180=900. 900 divided by 6 is 150. Correct.

n=0: Wait, n ≥1, so n=0 isn't considered. But just for testing, n=0 would be 0*(0 +5)=0, which is 6*0. But the problem says n ≥1, so okay.

Another test: n=6. 6*(7*36 +5)=6*(252 +5)=6*257=1542. 1542 divided by 6 is 257. Correct.

Seems like all examples check out. Therefore, my reasoning seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. For example, expanding the expression:

n(7n² +5) = 7n³ +5n. Maybe I can show that 7n³ +5n is divisible by 6. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, note that 7n³ +5n = 7n³ +5n. Let me see if I can factor this or relate it to known divisibility rules. Alternatively, maybe consider modulo 6.

But since we already have that it's divisible by 2 and 3, which are coprime, so that's sufficient. But maybe another approach.

Alternatively, think about parity and divisibility by 3. Wait, but that's similar to what I did before.

Alternatively, think about 7n³ +5n. Let me factor n: n(7n² +5). Which is what we started with.

Alternatively, maybe think about the expression modulo 6. Let me compute 7n³ +5n mod 6.

Note that 7 ≡ 1 mod 6, so 7n³ ≡ n³ mod 6. Similarly, 5 ≡ -1 mod 6, so 5n ≡ -n mod 6. Therefore, the entire expression is n³ - n mod 6. Therefore, we need to show that n³ -n ≡ 0 mod 6 for all integers n. Wait, that's a known identity!

Yes! The expression n³ -n is always divisible by 6. Because n³ -n = n(n² -1) = n(n -1)(n +1), which is the product of three consecutive integers. Since among any three consecutive integers, there is a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3, so the product is divisible by 2*3=6. Therefore, n³ -n is divisible by 6. 

But wait, in our case, the expression is 7n³ +5n, which we converted to n³ -n mod 6. Therefore, 7n³ +5n ≡ n³ -n ≡ 0 mod 6. Therefore, 7n³ +5n is divisible by 6. Therefore, the original expression is divisible by 6. 

Therefore, this gives another way to see it. So, that's a more straightforward approach. 

But how did I get from 7n³ +5n to n³ -n mod 6? Let me check again:

7n³ +5n. Since 7 ≡ 1 mod 6, so 7n³ ≡ 1*n³ mod 6. Similarly, 5 ≡ -1 mod 6, so 5n ≡ -n mod 6. Therefore, 7n³ +5n ≡ n³ -n mod 6. Therefore, the expression is congruent to n³ -n mod 6, which is known to be 0. Therefore, the original expression is divisible by 6. 

That's a much more elegant way. Therefore, the problem reduces to knowing that n³ -n is divisible by 6. Which is a standard result. So that's another way to see it. 

But since the problem says "establish that the integer n(7n² +5) is of the form 6k", maybe they expect the first approach, breaking into divisibility by 2 and 3. But both approaches are valid. 

Alternatively, maybe I can combine both. For example, since we can write the expression as 7n³ +5n, which is equivalent to n³ -n mod 6, which is divisible by 6. Therefore, the expression is divisible by 6. 

But regardless, both approaches confirm that it's divisible by 6. Therefore, the conclusion holds. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use mathematical induction. Let me try that as another method.

Base case: n=1. 1*(7*1 +5)=12, which is 6*2. So base case holds.

Assume that for some integer k ≥1, k(7k² +5) is divisible by 6. Then, need to show that (k+1)(7(k+1)² +5) is divisible by 6.

But this might be more complicated. Let me try expanding (k+1)(7(k+1)² +5):

First compute 7(k+1)² +5:

=7(k² + 2k +1) +5 =7k² +14k +7 +5 =7k² +14k +12.

Then multiply by (k+1):

(k+1)(7k² +14k +12) = k*(7k² +14k +12) +1*(7k² +14k +12)

=7k³ +14k² +12k +7k² +14k +12

=7k³ + (14k² +7k²) + (12k +14k) +12

=7k³ +21k² +26k +12.

Now, we need to check if this expression is divisible by 6. Since we have an inductive hypothesis that k(7k² +5) is divisible by 6, which is 7k³ +5k. Let me see if I can relate the new expression to the previous one.

But maybe this approach is getting too involved. Let me see if I can write the new expression as the previous one plus something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not straightforward. Maybe induction isn't the easiest way here. Since we already have two methods that work, maybe induction is not necessary. However, just for thoroughness, let me try.

We need to show that 7(k+1)^3 +5(k+1) is divisible by 6. Let's compute that:

7(k+1)^3 +5(k+1) = 7(k³ + 3k² + 3k +1) +5k +5 =7k³ +21k² +21k +7 +5k +5 =7k³ +21k² +26k +12.

Earlier, we had 7k³ +5k from the original expression. Let me subtract them:

(7k³ +21k² +26k +12) - (7k³ +5k) =21k² +21k +12.

So, the difference is 21k² +21k +12. Let me check if this is divisible by 6. 21k² +21k +12 = 21(k² +k) +12. Since 21 is 3*7 and 12 is 3*4. Let me see:

21(k² +k) +12 = 3*(7(k² +k) +4). Now, 7(k² +k) +4. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, check divisibility by 2 and 3.

Divisibility by 2: 21k² +21k +12. 21k² is odd*even? Wait, 21 is odd, k² is either even or odd. Let me check:

If k is even: k² is even, so 21k² is even (odd*even). Similarly, 21k is even (odd*even). Then 21k² +21k is even + even = even. Then adding 12 (even) gives even + even = even. So divisible by 2.

If k is odd: k² is odd, so 21k² is odd*odd=odd. Similarly, 21k is odd*odd=odd. Then odd + odd = even. Adding 12 (even) gives even + even = even. So regardless, divisible by 2.

Divisibility by 3: 21k² +21k +12. 21 is divisible by 3, so 21k² is divisible by 3, 21k is divisible by 3, and 12 is divisible by 3. Therefore, the entire expression is divisible by 3. Therefore, 21k² +21k +12 is divisible by 6. Therefore, the difference between the new expression and the original expression is divisible by 6. 

Since the original expression is divisible by 6 by the inductive hypothesis, then the new expression is also divisible by 6. Therefore, by induction, the statement holds for all n ≥1. 

So that's another method, using induction. But since we already have two methods that work, maybe induction is overkill. But it's good to check.

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the conclusion is that n(7n² +5) is divisible by 6. Therefore, it is of the form 6k for some integer k.

Another way to think about it: since n³ -n is divisible by 6, and 7n³ +5n is congruent to n³ -n mod 6, then 7n³ +5n is also divisible by 6. Therefore, the original expression is divisible by 6. 

So, in conclusion, the expression is divisible by both 2 and 3, hence by 6, and examples confirm this. Therefore, the statement is established.

**Final Answer**
The integer $ n(7n^2 + 5) $ is of the form $ 6k $ for some integer $ k $, so the answer is \boxed{6k}.

To prove that for all integers $ n \geq 1 $, the expression $ n(7n^2 + 5) $ is divisible by 6, we can approach the problem by analyzing the divisibility of the expression by both 2 and 3, since 6 is the product of these two coprime numbers.

### Step 1: Divisibility by 2

We examine the expression:

$$
n(7n^2 + 5)
$$

- If $ n $ is even, then the entire expression is even since it is a product involving $ n $, which is divisible by 2.
- If $ n $ is odd, then $ n^2 $ is also odd, and so $ 7n^2 $ is odd. Adding 5 (which is also odd) to an odd number yields an even number. Thus, $ 7n^2 + 5 $ is even.

In either case, the expression $ n(7n^2 + 5) $ is even. Therefore, the expression is divisible by 2.

### Step 2: Divisibility by 3

We now consider the expression modulo 3. First, note the following congruences:

- $ 7 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $
- $ 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} $

Thus, the expression becomes:

$$
n(7n^2 + 5) \equiv n(n^2 + 2) \pmod{3}
$$

We now examine the behavior of $ n(n^2 + 2) \mod 3 $ for all possible values of $ n \mod 3 $:

- If $ n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $, then the expression is $ 0 \times (0 + 2) = 0 \mod 3 $
- If $ n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $, then $ n^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $, so $ n^2 + 2 \equiv 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $, and the expression is $ 1 \times 0 = 0 \mod 3 $
- If $ n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} $, then $ n^2 \equiv 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $, so $ n^2 + 2 \equiv 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $, and the expression is again $ 2 \times 0 = 0 \mod 3 $

In all cases, the expression is divisible by 3.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion

Since the expression is divisible by both 2 and 3, and since 2 and 3 are coprime, it follows that the expression is divisible by $ \text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6 $.

Thus, for all integers $ n \geq 1 $, the expression $ n(7n^2 + 5) $ is divisible by 6, and can be written in the form:

$$
n(7n^2 + 5) = 6k
$$

for some integer $ k $.
