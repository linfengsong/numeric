 (a) Let's consider two odd integers, say a and b. Since they are odd, we can write them as a = 2m + 1 and b = 2n + 1, where m and n are integers. Now, let's square these two numbers and add them together:

a^2 + b^2 = (2m + 1)^2 + (2n + 1)^2
= 4m^2 + 4m + 1 + 4n^2 + 4n + 1
= 4(m^2 + m) + 4(n^2 + n) + 2

Now, let's try to factor out a 4 from the first two terms:

4(m^2 + m) + 4(n^2 + n) + 2 = 4(m^2 + m + n^2 + n) + 2

Notice that the expression inside the parentheses is an integer, let's call it k (k = m^2 + m + n^2 + n). So we have:

4k + 2

Now, we want to show that this expression cannot be a perfect square. If it were a perfect square, it would be of the form (2l + 1)^2 for some integer l. Expanding this gives:

(2l + 1)^2 = 4l^2 + 4l + 1

Comparing this with our expression 4k + 2, we see that they are not the same. Specifically, the term 4l^2 in the perfect square is missing in our expression. Therefore, the sum of the squares of two odd integers cannot be a perfect square.

(b) Let's consider four consecutive integers, say n, n+1, n+2, and n+3. The product of these four numbers is:

n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)

Now, let's multiply the first and last numbers together, and the second and third numbers together:

(n(n+3))((n+1)(n+2))

Notice that the expression inside each set of parentheses is the product of two consecutive integers, which is always one less than a perfect square. For example, 2*3 = 6, which is one less than 7^2; 4*5 = 20, which is one less than 5^2, and so on.

So, we can write:

(n(n+3))((n+1)(n+2)) = (m^2 - 1)(m^2 + 1)

where m is an integer. Now, let's expand this:

(m^2 - 1)(m^2 + 1) = m^4 + m^2 - m^2 - 1
= m^4 - 1

Notice that this is one less than a perfect square (m^4). Therefore, the product of four consecutive integers is 1 less than a perfect square.
