 To prove this, we need to understand the properties of divisibility and the concept of consecutive integers.

First, let's consider the product of any three consecutive integers. We can represent these integers as n, n+1, and n+2. The product of these three integers can be written as n(n+1)(n+2).

Now, let's analyze the divisibility by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. 

1. Divisibility by 2: In any three consecutive integers, at least one of them must be even (divisible by 2). This is because every other number is even. So, one of the three numbers in our product will be divisible by 2.

2. Divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of any three consecutive integers is always divisible by 3. This is because the sum of the digits of n, n+1, and n+2 is 3n+3, which is always divisible by 3. Therefore, one of the three numbers in our product will be divisible by 3.

Since the product of any three consecutive integers is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6.

Next, let's consider the product of any four consecutive integers. We can represent these integers as n, n+1, n+2, and n+3. The product of these four integers can be written as n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3).

Now, let's analyze the divisibility by 24. A number is divisible by 24 if it is divisible by both 8 and 3.

1. Divisibility by 8: In any four consecutive integers, at least one of them must be divisible by 8. This is because every eighth number is divisible by 8. So, one of the four numbers in our product will be divisible by 8.

2. Divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of any four consecutive integers is always divisible by 3. This is because the sum of the digits of n, n+1, n+2, and n+3 is 4n+6, which is always divisible by 3. Therefore, one of the four numbers in our product will be divisible by 3.

Since the product of any four consecutive integers is divisible by both 8 and 3, it is divisible by 24.

Finally, let's consider the product of any five consecutive integers. We can represent these integers as n, n+1, n+2, n+3, and n+4. The product of these five integers can be written as n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4).

Now, let's analyze the divisibility by 120. A number is divisible by 120 if it is divisible by both 5, 4, and 3.

1. Divisibility by 5: In any five consecutive integers, at least one of them must be divisible by 5. This is because every fifth number is divisible by 5. So, one of the five numbers in our product will be divisible by 5.

2. Divisibility by 4: In any five consecutive integers, at least one of them must be divisible by 4. This is because every fourth number is divisible by 4. So, one of the five numbers in our product will be divisible by 4.

3. Divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of any five consecutive integers is always divisible by 3. This is because the sum of the digits of n, n+1, n+2, n+3, and n+4 is 5n+10, which is always divisible by 3. Therefore, one of the five numbers in our product will be divisible by 3.

Since the product of any five consecutive integers is divisible by both 5, 4, and 3, it is divisible by 120.

In conclusion, we have proven that the product of any three consecutive integers is divisible by 6, the product of any four consecutive integers is divisible by 24, and the product of any five consecutive integers is divisible by 120.
