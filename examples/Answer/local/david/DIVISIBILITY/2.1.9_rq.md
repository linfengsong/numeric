Okay, so I need to establish the identity $ t_x = t_y + t_z $ where $ x = \frac{n(n+3)}{2} + 1 $, $ y = n + 1 $, and $ z = \frac{n(n+3)}{2} $ for $ n \geq 1 $. Then, using this identity, prove that there are infinitely many triangular numbers that are the sum of two other triangular numbers. Also, part (b) asks for three examples of such triangular numbers. 

First, let me recall what triangular numbers are. A triangular number $ t_k $ is given by the formula $ t_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} $. So, for example, $ t_1 = 1 $, $ t_2 = 3 $, $ t_3 = 6 $, and so on. 

The problem is about showing that for certain values of x, y, z, the triangular number at position x is equal to the sum of the triangular numbers at positions y and z. Then, since n can be any integer greater than or equal to 1, there are infinitely many such cases, hence infinitely many triangular numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two others. 

Let me start by writing down the expressions for $ t_x $, $ t_y $, and $ t_z $ in terms of n. 

First, compute x, y, z:

Given:
- $ x = \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} + 1 $
- $ y = n + 1 $
- $ z = \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} $

So, let me compute $ t_x $, $ t_y $, and $ t_z $:

Starting with $ t_y $:

Since $ y = n + 1 $, then $ t_y = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} $.

Similarly, $ t_z $ is $ \frac{z(z + 1)}{2} $, where $ z = \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} $. Let me compute that:

First, compute z:

$ z = \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} $. Let me denote that as $ z = \frac{n^2 + 3n}{2} $.

Therefore, $ t_z = \frac{z(z + 1)}{2} = \frac{ \left( \frac{n^2 + 3n}{2} \right) \left( \frac{n^2 + 3n}{2} + 1 \right) }{2} $.

Similarly, $ t_x $ is $ \frac{x(x + 1)}{2} $, where $ x = \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} + 1 $. Let me compute that:

First, compute x:

$ x = \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} + 1 = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} $. Wait, because $ \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} + 1 = \frac{n^2 + 3n}{2} + \frac{2}{2} = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} $.

Note that $ n^2 + 3n + 2 = (n + 1)(n + 2) $. Let me check:

$ (n + 1)(n + 2) = n^2 + 3n + 2 $. Yes, correct. Therefore, $ x = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} $. Wait, but that's exactly $ t_{n + 1} $? Wait, no. Wait, $ t_{n + 1} = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} $. So, x is equal to $ t_{n + 1} $? Wait, but that would mean that $ t_x = t_{t_{n + 1}} $? Wait, no. Wait, x is equal to $ t_{n + 1} $, but x is the index of the triangular number. Wait, no. Wait, hold on:

Wait, x is equal to $ \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} $, which is exactly $ t_{n + 1} $. Therefore, $ t_x = t_{t_{n + 1}} $? Wait, no. Wait, x is the index, so $ t_x $ is the triangular number at position x. So, if x is equal to $ t_{n + 1} $, then $ t_x = t_{t_{n + 1}} $. But that seems complicated. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here?

Wait, let me check again:

Original expression for x:

$ x = \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} + 1 $. Let me compute this:

Let me compute $ n(n + 3) = n^2 + 3n $. Then, adding 1 gives $ n^2 + 3n + 1 $. Wait, no. Wait, no, the original expression is $ \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} + 1 $, which is $ \frac{n(n + 3) + 2}{2} $. Therefore, numerator is $ n^2 + 3n + 2 $, which factors as (n + 1)(n + 2). Therefore, x = $ \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} $. Therefore, x is equal to $ t_{n + 1} $, because $ t_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} $. Wait, so if x = $ \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} $, then x is equal to $ t_{n + 1} $. Therefore, $ t_x = t_{t_{n + 1}} $. Wait, but that seems like a different thing. Wait, but maybe I need to check again.

Wait, no. Wait, the index x is equal to $ t_{n + 1} $, so $ t_x $ is the triangular number whose index is $ t_{n + 1} $. So, $ t_x = \frac{t_{n + 1} (t_{n + 1} + 1)}{2} $. That seems complicated. But maybe there's another way. 

But the problem says that $ t_x = t_y + t_z $. So, perhaps I need to compute $ t_x $, $ t_y $, and $ t_z $, and show that they satisfy this equation. Let me try that.

First, compute $ t_y $:

As above, $ t_y = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} $. So, that's straightforward.

Then, $ t_z $: z is $ \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} $, so:

$ t_z = \frac{z(z + 1)}{2} = \frac{ \left( \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} \right) \left( \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} + 1 \right) }{2} $.

Let me compute that:

First, compute $ z + 1 = \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} + 1 = \frac{n(n + 3) + 2}{2} = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} $. Wait, that's interesting. So z + 1 is equal to $ \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} $, which is exactly $ t_{n + 1} $. Therefore, $ t_z = \frac{ z \times (z + 1) }{2} = \frac{ z \times t_{n + 1} }{2} $.

But z is $ \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} $, so:

$ t_z = \frac{ \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} \times t_{n + 1} }{2} = \frac{n(n + 3)}{4} \times t_{n + 1} $.

Hmm, not sure if that helps yet. Let me compute $ t_x $:

Earlier, we found that x is equal to $ \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} $, which is $ t_{n + 1} $. Therefore, $ t_x = \frac{ x(x + 1) }{2} = \frac{ t_{n + 1} (t_{n + 1} + 1) }{2} $.

So, if we can show that $ \frac{ t_{n + 1} (t_{n + 1} + 1) }{2} = t_y + t_z $, then we are done. Since $ t_y = t_{n + 1} $, then:

So, substituting:

Left-hand side (LHS): $ \frac{ t_{n + 1} (t_{n + 1} + 1) }{2} $

Right-hand side (RHS): $ t_y + t_z = t_{n + 1} + t_z $

Therefore, we need to show that:

$ \frac{ t_{n + 1} (t_{n + 1} + 1) }{2} = t_{n + 1} + t_z $

Let me rearrange this equation:

Multiply both sides by 2:

$ t_{n + 1} (t_{n + 1} + 1) = 2 t_{n + 1} + 2 t_z $

Divide both sides by $ t_{n + 1} $ (assuming $ t_{n + 1} \neq 0 $, which it isn't for n ≥ 1):

$ t_{n + 1} + 1 = 2 + \frac{2 t_z}{t_{n + 1}} $

Therefore:

$ t_{n + 1} + 1 - 2 = \frac{2 t_z}{t_{n + 1}} $

Simplify left side:

$ t_{n + 1} - 1 = \frac{2 t_z}{t_{n + 1}} $

Multiply both sides by $ t_{n + 1} $:

$ t_{n + 1}^2 - t_{n + 1} = 2 t_z $

So, if I can show that $ t_{n + 1}^2 - t_{n + 1} = 2 t_z $, then the identity holds.

Let me compute $ t_{n + 1}^2 - t_{n + 1} $:

First, $ t_{n + 1} = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} $. Therefore, $ t_{n + 1}^2 = \left( \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} \right)^2 $. Then subtract $ t_{n + 1} $:

So:

$ t_{n + 1}^2 - t_{n + 1} = t_{n + 1} (t_{n + 1} - 1) $

Let me compute that:

First, $ t_{n + 1} - 1 = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} - 1 = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2) - 2}{2} $.

Compute numerator:

$ (n + 1)(n + 2) - 2 = n^2 + 3n + 2 - 2 = n^2 + 3n $.

Therefore, $ t_{n + 1} - 1 = \frac{n^2 + 3n}{2} $.

But wait, that's exactly z! Because z is $ \frac{n(n + 3)}{2} $. So, z = $ \frac{n^2 + 3n}{2} $. Therefore, $ t_{n + 1} - 1 = z $.

Therefore, $ t_{n + 1}^2 - t_{n + 1} = t_{n + 1} \times z $.

Therefore, according to our previous equation, we have:

$ t_{n + 1}^2 - t_{n + 1} = 2 t_z $

Which implies:

$ t_{n + 1} \times z = 2 t_z $

Therefore, we need to check if this equality holds. Let me compute $ t_z $:

Earlier, we had:

$ t_z = \frac{ z(z + 1) }{2} $. But z + 1 is equal to $ \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} $, which is $ t_{n + 1} $. Therefore, $ t_z = \frac{ z \times t_{n + 1} }{2} $.

Therefore, substituting into the equation $ t_{n + 1} \times z = 2 t_z $:

Left side: $ t_{n + 1} \times z $

Right side: 2 * $ \frac{ z \times t_{n + 1} }{2} $ = $ z \times t_{n + 1} $

Therefore, both sides are equal. So, the equation holds. Therefore, our original equation $ t_x = t_y + t_z $ is valid. 

Therefore, we have established that for any n ≥ 1, the triangular number $ t_x $ is equal to the sum of $ t_y $ and $ t_z $, where x, y, z are defined as above. Since there are infinitely many n ≥ 1, this shows there are infinitely many triangular numbers that are sums of two other triangular numbers. That answers part (a).

Now, part (b) asks for three examples of triangular numbers that are sums of two other triangular numbers. 

Since we have an identity that works for any n ≥ 1, we can pick specific values of n to compute concrete examples. Let me choose n = 1, 2, 3, and see what we get.

First, let's take n = 1:

Compute x, y, z:

x = [1*(1 + 3)]/2 + 1 = [1*4]/2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

y = 1 + 1 = 2

z = [1*(1 + 3)]/2 = 4/2 = 2

Therefore, t_x = t_3 = 6, t_y = t_2 = 3, t_z = t_2 = 3. Therefore, 6 = 3 + 3. So, 6 is the sum of 3 and 3. So, 6 is a triangular number that is the sum of two other triangular numbers.

Wait, but 3 is itself a triangular number, so this is valid. So, 6 is an example.

Let me check n = 2:

x = [2*(2 + 3)]/2 + 1 = [2*5]/2 + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6

y = 2 + 1 = 3

z = [2*(2 + 3)]/2 = 10/2 = 5

Therefore, t_x = t_6 = 21, t_y = t_3 = 6, t_z = t_5 = 15. Then, 6 + 15 = 21. So, 21 = 6 + 15. So, 21 is another example.

Third example, n = 3:

x = [3*(3 + 3)]/2 + 1 = [3*6]/2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10

y = 3 + 1 = 4

z = [3*(3 + 3)]/2 = 18/2 = 9

Therefore, t_x = t_10 = 55, t_y = t_4 = 10, t_z = t_9 = 45. Then, 10 + 45 = 55. So, 55 is another example.

Therefore, three examples are 6, 21, and 55. However, let me check if these are distinct and if they are indeed triangular numbers. 

t_3 = 6, yes. t_6 = 21, yes. t_10 = 55, yes. So, these are valid examples. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants three different examples, but these are three different triangular numbers. 

But let me check if there are other examples. For n=4:

x = [4*(4 + 3)]/2 + 1 = [4*7]/2 + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15

y = 4 + 1 = 5

z = [4*7]/2 = 14

So, t_x = t_15 = 120, t_y = t_5 = 15, t_z = t_14 = 105. 15 + 105 = 120. So, 120 is another example. 

So, maybe the problem wants three examples, so 6, 21, 55, or 120, etc. So, the answer for part (b) can be these numbers.

But let me check if there are other examples not generated by this formula. For example, maybe some smaller triangular numbers. For instance, 1 is t_1. Can 1 be written as sum of two triangular numbers? Well, the only way is 0 + 1, but 0 isn't considered a triangular number here (since triangular numbers are defined for positive integers). Similarly, t_2 = 3. Can 3 be written as sum of two triangular numbers? 1 + 2? But 2 isn't a triangular number. Wait, triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, etc. So, 3 can be written as 1 + 2, but 2 is not triangular. Alternatively, 3 = 3 + 0. Again, 0 is not considered. So, maybe 3 cannot be expressed as sum of two triangular numbers. Similarly, 6 can be 3 + 3. So, 6 is the first one. 

So, the examples generated by the formula are valid. Therefore, part (b) can be
