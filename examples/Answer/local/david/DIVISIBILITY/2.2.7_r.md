 To obtain the Division Algorithm with the given conditions, we will use the standard Division Algorithm and manipulate the results to fit the desired conditions.

The standard Division Algorithm states that for any integers a and b, with b ≠ 0, there exist unique integers q and r such that a = qb + r, where 0 ≤ r < |b|.

Now, let's consider the case where b > 0. In this case, the standard Division Algorithm gives us 0 ≤ r < b. We can rewrite this as 0 ≤ r ≤ b - 1. 

Next, we multiply both sides of the inequality by -1, which gives us -r ≥ -b + 1. Then, we add b to both sides, which gives us b - r ≥ 1. 

Now, we can rewrite the inequality as -b + 1 ≤ r, which is equivalent to -b + 1 ≤ r < 0. 

Since b > 0, we have -b < 0. Therefore, we can rewrite the inequality as -b < r < 0. 

Now, we can multiply all parts of the inequality by -1, which gives us b > -r > 0. 

Finally, we can rewrite the inequality as 0 < -r ≤ b, which is equivalent to 0 < r ≤ b. 

Now, let's consider the case where b < 0. In this case, the standard Division Algorithm gives us 0 ≤ r < -b. We can rewrite this as 0 ≤ r ≤ -b - 1. 

Next, we multiply both sides of the inequality by -1, which gives us -r ≥ b + 1. Then, we add b to both sides, which gives us b - r ≥ 1. 

Now, we can rewrite the inequality as -b - 1 ≤ r, which is equivalent to -b - 1 ≤ r < 0. 

Since b < 0, we have -b > 0. Therefore, we can rewrite the inequality as -b - 1 < r < 0. 

Now, we can multiply all parts of the inequality by -1, which gives us b + 1 > -r > 0. 

Finally, we can rewrite the inequality as 0 < -r ≤ b + 1, which is equivalent to 0 < r ≤ b + 1. 

Now, we can combine the results for both cases, b > 0 and b < 0, to obtain the desired version of the Division Algorithm:

For integers a and b, with b ≠ 0, there exist unique integers q and r that satisfy a = qb + r, where $-\frac{1}{2}|b| < r \leq{\frac{1}{2}|b|}$.
