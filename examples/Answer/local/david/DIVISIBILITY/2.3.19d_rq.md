Okay, so I need to prove that if an integer a is not divisible by 2 or 3, then 24 divides (a² + 23). Hmm, let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. 

First, the integer a is not divisible by 2 or 3. That means a is an odd number (since it's not divisible by 2) and also not a multiple of 3. So, a must be congruent to 1 or 5 mod 6, right? Because numbers not divisible by 2 or 3 are the numbers that are coprime to 6. Let me check that. The numbers coprime to 6 are 1, 5, 7, 11, etc. So yeah, modulo 6, they are either 1 or 5. 

So maybe I can consider cases where a ≡ 1 mod 6 or a ≡ 5 mod 6. Then compute a² + 23 and check if it's divisible by 24. But 24 is 8*3, so maybe I can check divisibility by 8 and by 3 separately? Because if something is divisible by both 8 and 3, then it's divisible by 24. That might be a good approach. Let me try that.

First, let's check divisibility by 3. Since a is not divisible by 3, then a ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3. Let me compute a² mod 3. If a ≡ 1 mod 3, then a² ≡ 1² = 1 mod 3. If a ≡ 2 mod 3, then a² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. So in either case, a² ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, a² + 23 ≡ 1 + 23 mod 3. Let me compute 23 mod 3. 3*7=21, so 23-21=2. So 23 ≡ 2 mod 3. Therefore, a² + 23 ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. So that's good, a² + 23 is divisible by 3. 

Now, check divisibility by 8. Since a is not divisible by 2, it's odd. So a is odd. Let me think about a² mod 8. Let me recall that for odd numbers, their squares mod 8 are 1. Wait, let me check. Let me take some examples. 

If a is 1 mod 8, then a² is 1 mod 8. If a is 3 mod 8, then 3²=9≡1 mod 8. Similarly, 5²=25≡1 mod 8, 7²=49≡1 mod 8. Wait, so any odd number squared is congruent to 1 mod 8? That seems right. Let me confirm with another example: 9 mod 8 is 1, 9²=81≡1 mod 8. Yeah, so regardless of which odd number you take, its square is 1 mod 8. Therefore, a² ≡ 1 mod 8. Therefore, a² + 23 ≡ 1 + 23 mod 8. 23 divided by 8 is 2*8=16, 23-16=7, so 23≡7 mod 8. Therefore, 1 + 7 = 8 ≡ 0 mod 8. Therefore, a² + 23 is divisible by 8. 

Since a² + 23 is divisible by both 3 and 8, and 3 and 8 are coprime, then it must be divisible by 24. Therefore, 24 divides a² + 23. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check with some examples to make sure. Let me take a few numbers not divisible by 2 or 3 and see if a² + 23 is divisible by 24. 

Take a=1. Then 1² + 23 = 24. 24 is divisible by 24. Good. 

Take a=5. 5² +23=25 +23=48. 48 divided by 24 is 2. Good. 

Take a=7. 7² +23=49 +23=72. 72 divided by 24 is 3. Good. 

Take a=11. 11²=121. 121 +23=144. 144 divided by 24 is 6. Perfect. 

Take a=13. 13²=169. 169 +23=192. 192/24=8. Yep. 

Another one, a=17. 17²=289. 289 +23=312. 312 divided by 24 is 13. So that works. 

Wait, so all these examples work. So seems like the logic is correct. 

But let me think again about the modulus. For divisibility by 8, I said that any odd number squared is 1 mod 8. Let me confirm that again. Let me take a general odd number. Let me write a as 2k +1, where k is integer. Then a² = (2k +1)^2 = 4k² +4k +1 = 4k(k +1) +1. Now, since either k or k+1 is even, so k(k+1) is even. Therefore, 4k(k +1) is divisible by 8. Therefore, a² ≡1 mod 8. Yes, that's correct. So regardless of k, that term is divisible by 8. Therefore, a² ≡1 mod 8. Therefore, adding 23, which is 7 mod 8, gives 1 +7=8≡0 mod 8. 

Similarly, for modulus 3. Since a is not divisible by 3, then a ≡1 or 2 mod 3. Then a² ≡1 mod 3, as I showed before. Then adding 23, which is 2 mod 3, gives 1 +2=3≡0 mod 3. 

Therefore, since 8 and 3 are coprime, then 24 divides a² +23. 

But maybe I can approach this problem using another method. Let me think. Since a is not divisible by 2 or 3, then a is coprime to 6. So maybe using Euler's theorem? But Euler's theorem says that if a and n are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡1 mod n. However, φ(24)=φ(8*3)=φ(8)*φ(3)=4*2=8. So a^8 ≡1 mod 24? Wait, but I don't know if that helps here. Maybe not directly. 

Alternatively, since we need to show that a² ≡ -23 mod 24. Let me compute -23 mod 24. Since 24 -23=1, so -23 ≡1 mod 24. Wait, so does that mean that a² ≡1 mod 24? Wait, if a² +23 ≡0 mod24, then a² ≡-23 mod24. But -23 mod24 is 1, so a² ≡1 mod24. So if I can show that a² ≡1 mod24, then that would be sufficient. 

But is that true? Let me check with previous examples. For a=1, 1²=1≡1 mod24. For a=5, 25≡1 mod24. For a=7, 49≡1 mod24 (since 48 is 2*24). For a=11, 121 mod24: 24*5=120, so 121≡1 mod24. Similarly, 13²=169, 168 is 7*24, so 169≡1 mod24. So yes, seems like a²≡1 mod24. Therefore, a² +23≡1 +23=24≡0 mod24. 

So if I can show that a² ≡1 mod24, then done. 

But how to show that? Well, since a is not divisible by 2 or 3, so a is coprime to 24. So maybe using Euler's theorem? φ(24)=8, so a^8≡1 mod24. But we need a²≡1 mod24. Wait, but that might not hold. For example, take a=5. 5²=25≡1 mod24. 5^8=(5²)^4≡1^4=1 mod24. So maybe in this case, a²≡1 mod24. But is this true for all a coprime to 24? 

Wait, take a=7. 7²=49≡1 mod24. Similarly, a=11. 11²=121≡1 mod24. a=13. 13²=169≡1 mod24. a=17. 17²=289. 289 divided by 24: 24*12=288, so 289≡1 mod24. So seems like for numbers coprime to 24, their squares are 1 mod24? Wait, is that a general result? 

Wait, let me check a=5 mod24. Let me check a=5, 5²=25≡1 mod24. Similarly, a=7, same. What about a=11? 11 mod24. 11²=121≡1 mod24. What about a=13? 13²=169≡1 mod24. Similarly, a=17: 17²=289≡1 mod24. a=19: 19²=361. 360 is 15*24, so 361≡1 mod24. a=23: 23²=529. 528 is 22*24, so 529≡1 mod24. So all numbers coprime to 24, when squared, give 1 mod24? That seems to be the case. 

But why? Is there a theorem for that? Well, since 24=8*3. If we can show that a²≡1 mod8 and a²≡1 mod3, then by Chinese remainder theorem, a²≡1 mod24. Which is exactly what we did earlier. Because we showed that a²≡1 mod8 and a²≡1 mod3. Therefore, since 8 and 3 are coprime, then a²≡1 mod24. Therefore, a² +23≡1 +23=24≡0 mod24. 

So that's another way to think about it. So maybe the problem is equivalent to showing that a²≡1 mod24. Which is true for numbers coprime to 24. 

But why is a²≡1 mod8 and mod3? Well, for mod3, since a is not divisible by 3, then a≡1 or 2 mod3, and squaring gives 1. For mod8, since a is odd, a≡1,3,5,7 mod8, and squaring gives 1 mod8. 

Therefore, combining these two, we get that a²≡1 mod24. Therefore, a² +23≡1 +23=24≡0 mod24. 

So that's another way to look at it. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if a is not divisible by 2 or 3, then a is congruent to ±1, ±5 mod 12. Wait, maybe not necessary. 

Alternatively, since a is not divisible by 2 or 3, then a can be written as 6k ±1. Let me try that. Let me suppose that a=6k +1 or a=6k -1. Let me check both cases. 

Case 1: a=6k +1. Then compute a² +23. 

a² = (6k +1)^2 = 36k² +12k +1. Then a² +23 = 36k² +12k +1 +23 = 36k² +12k +24. Factor out 12: 12*(3k² +k +2). Now, check if this is divisible by 24. So 12*(something). To get 24, we need that something to be even. So check if 3k² +k +2 is even. Let me compute 3k² +k +2 mod2. 

Since 3≡1 mod2, so 3k² ≡k² mod2. Then k² +k +2 ≡k² +k mod2. Because 2≡0 mod2. 

Now, k² +k =k(k +1). Which is the product of two consecutive integers, so it's even. Therefore, k(k +1) is even. Therefore, 3k² +k +2 is even. Therefore, 12*(even) = 24*(integer). Therefore, divisible by 24. 

Case 2: a=6k -1. Then compute a² +23. 

a² = (6k -1)^2 = 36k² -12k +1. Then a² +23 = 36k² -12k +1 +23 = 36k² -12k +24. Factor out 12: 12*(3k² -k +2). Again, check if 3k² -k +2 is even. 

Again compute mod2: 3k² -k +2 ≡k² -k mod2. Because 3≡1 mod2 and 2≡0 mod2. 

So k² -k =k(k -1). Which is the product of two consecutive integers, so it's even. Therefore, k(k -1) is even. Therefore, 3k² -k +2 is even. Therefore, 12*(even) = 24*(integer). Therefore, divisible by 24. 

Therefore, in both cases, whether a is 6k +1 or 6k -1, a² +23 is divisible by 24. 

So that's another way to approach it. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use modular arithmetic directly. Since a is not divisible by 2 or 3, then a ≡1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23 mod24. Wait, but since 24 is the modulus, maybe considering all residues coprime to 24. But since we already showed that a² ≡1 mod24, then adding 23 gives 24≡0 mod24. 

But perhaps I can check each residue. Let me check. The numbers coprime to 24 are the numbers from 1 to 23 that are not divisible by 2 or 3. So they are: 1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23. Let me compute a² +23 for each of these and check divisibility by 24. 

For a=1: 1 +23=24. Divisible by 24. 

a=5: 25 +23=48. Divisible by 24. 

a=7: 49 +23=72. Divisible by 24. 

a=11: 121 +23=144. Divisible by 24. 

a=13: 169 +23=192. Divisible by 24. 

a=17: 289 +23=312. Divisible by 24. 

a=19: 361 +23=384. Divisible by 24. 

a=23: 529 +23=552. Divisible by 24. 

So all of them work. Therefore, since all residues coprime to 24 satisfy the condition, then for any integer a not divisible by 2 or 3, a² +23 is divisible by 24. 

Therefore, the assertion holds. 

But maybe there's another way to think about it. For example, using the fact that if a is not divisible by 2 or 3, then a is congruent to 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23 mod24. As above. But since we have already checked all these residues, and they all satisfy the condition, then the conclusion follows. 

Alternatively, since we have already shown that a² ≡1 mod24, which is equivalent to a² +23 ≡0 mod24, then the result holds. 

But maybe I need to be careful here. Because in general, for numbers not divisible by 2 or 3, does a² ≡1 mod24 always hold? Let me check another example. Let me take a= -1 mod24, which is 23. 23²=529. 529 divided by 24 is 22*24=528, so 529≡1 mod24. Yep. 

Another example, a= -5 mod24, which is 19. 19²=361. 361 - 24*15=361-360=1. So 1 mod24. 

Same with a= -7 mod24, which is 17. 17²=289. 289 - 24*12=289 - 288=
