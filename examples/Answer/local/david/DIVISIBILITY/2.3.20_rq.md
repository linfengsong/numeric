Okay, so I need to confirm these properties of the greatest common divisor. Let me take them one by one. Starting with part (a). 

(a) If gcd(a, b) = 1 and gcd(a, c) = 1, then gcd(a, bc) = 1. The hint says to use the fact that 1 can be expressed as ax + by and au + cv, then multiply them. Let me think. 

First, since gcd(a, b) = 1, by the definition of gcd, there exist integers x and y such that 1 = ax + by. Similarly, since gcd(a, c) = 1, there exist integers u and v such that 1 = au + cv. 

Now, if I multiply these two equations together: (ax + by)(au + cv) = 1*1 = 1. Let me expand this product. 

Multiplying out, we get:

ax*au + ax*cv + by*au + by*cv = a^2xu + acxv + abyu + bcyv. 

Hmm, so grouping terms:

= a(axu + bxv + byu) + bc(yv). 

Wait, the hint says it's a(aux + cvx + byu) + bc(yv). Let me check. 

Wait, maybe I need to factor out a from some terms. Let me see:

The first term is a^2xu, which is a times axu. The second term is acxv, which is a times cxv. The third term is abyu, which is a times byu. The fourth term is bcyv, which is bc times yv. 

So combining the first three terms, they all have a factor of a. So:

a(axu + cxv + byu) + bc(yv). 

So the entire expression is equal to 1. Therefore, 1 can be written as a*(some integer) + bc*(some integer). That means that a and bc have a linear combination that equals 1, which implies that gcd(a, bc) divides 1. Since gcd(a, bc) is a positive integer, it must be 1. Therefore, gcd(a, bc) = 1. 

Okay, that seems to work. So part (a) is confirmed. 

Moving on to part (b): If gcd(a, b) = 1 and c divides a, then gcd(b, c) = 1. 

Let me think. If c divides a, then a = c*k for some integer k. So since gcd(a, b) = 1, that means that gcd(c*k, b) = 1. Let me recall that gcd(c*k, b) = gcd(c, b) if gcd(k, b) = 1? Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Wait, actually, gcd(c*k, b) = gcd(c, b) * gcd(k, b / gcd(c, b))? Maybe not. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b) = 1, and a is c*k, then any common divisor of c and b must divide a and b, but since gcd(a, b) = 1, that common divisor must be 1. So suppose d divides both c and b. Then d divides c and d divides b. Since c divides a, then d divides a. Therefore, d divides a and d divides b, so d divides gcd(a, b) = 1. Hence, d = 1. Therefore, gcd(b, c) = 1. 

Yes, that seems to work. So if there is a common divisor of b and c, it must divide a and b, which are coprime, so only 1. Therefore, gcd(b, c) = 1. 

Part (b) is done. 

Part (c): If gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(ac, b) = gcd(c, b). 

Hmm. Let me think. Let me denote d = gcd(ac, b). Then d divides ac and d divides b. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then any common divisor of ac and b must divide c and b? Wait, let me recall that if gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a, b) = 1 implies that any common divisor of ac and b must divide c and b? 

Wait, suppose d divides ac and d divides b. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then d must divide c. Because if d divides b and d divides ac, and since a and b are coprime, then d can't have any common factors with a. Therefore, d divides c. Therefore, gcd(ac, b) divides c and b, so gcd(ac, b) divides gcd(c, b). 

Conversely, if we take gcd(c, b), then since gcd(a, b) = 1, gcd(c, b) divides b, and since gcd(a, b) = 1, gcd(c, b) divides c, and since a and b are coprime, gcd(c, b) doesn't have any factors in common with a, so gcd(c, b) divides ac. Therefore, gcd(ac, b) is equal to gcd(c, b). 

Alternatively, maybe using the property that gcd(a, b) = 1 implies gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b), and then maybe using some properties of gcd. Let me try to use the formula. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(ac, b) = gcd(c, b). Let me think of specific examples. Suppose a = 2, b = 3, c = 4. Then gcd(2, 3) = 1. Then gcd(2*4, 3) = gcd(8, 3) = 1. And gcd(4, 3) is 1. So same. Another example: a = 3, b = 4, c = 6. gcd(3, 4) = 1. Then gcd(3*6, 4) = gcd(18, 4) = 2. And gcd(6, 4) = 2. So same. So seems like the property holds. 

But how to prove it? Let me think. 

Let me denote d = gcd(ac, b). Then d divides b and d divides ac. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then d divides c. Because suppose d divides b and divides ac. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a, d) divides gcd(a, b) = 1, so gcd(a, d) = 1. Therefore, since d divides ac and gcd(a, d) = 1, then d divides c. Therefore, d divides gcd(c, b). Hence, gcd(ac, b) divides gcd(c, b). 

Conversely, if d divides gcd(c, b), then d divides c and d divides b. Therefore, d divides ac and d divides b, so d divides gcd(ac, b). Therefore, gcd(ac, b) = gcd(c, b). 

So that's the proof. 

Part (c) is done. 

Part (d): If gcd(a, b) = 1 and c divides a + b, then gcd(a, c) = gcd(b, c) = 1. 

The hint says to let d = gcd(a, c). Then d divides a and d divides c, so d divides (a + b) - a = b. Therefore, d divides b. But since gcd(a, b) = 1, then d divides 1. Therefore, d = 1. Hence, gcd(a, c) = 1. Similarly, same logic for gcd(b, c). 

Let me check. Suppose d divides a and c. Then since c divides a + b, then a + b = c*k for some integer k. Then d divides a and d divides c, so d divides c*k, which is a + b. Therefore, d divides (a + b) - a = b. Therefore, d divides b. But since gcd(a, b) = 1, then d divides 1, hence d = 1. Therefore, gcd(a, c) = 1. Similarly, if we take d = gcd(b, c), then d divides b and c, so d divides a + b - b = a. Then since gcd(a, b) = 1, d divides 1. Therefore, gcd(b, c) = 1. 

Therefore, both gcd(a, c) and gcd(b, c) are 1. 

Part (d) is done. 

Part (e): If gcd(a, b) = 1, d divides ac, and d divides bc, then d divides c. 

Hmm. Let me think. So given that gcd(a, b) = 1, and d divides ac and d divides bc, then d divides c. 

Let me think. Since d divides ac and d divides bc, then d divides any linear combination of ac and bc. For example, d divides c*(a - b) or something? Wait, but maybe more straightforward. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b) = 1, then there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = 1. 

If d divides ac and d divides bc, then d divides ac and d divides bc. Let me think about prime factors. Suppose that p is a prime divisor of d. Then p divides ac and p divides bc. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then p cannot divide both a and b. Therefore, p divides c. Hence, all prime factors of d divide c, so d divides c. 

Alternatively, suppose d divides ac and d divides bc. Then, since gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a, b) = 1 implies that gcd(a, b) divides 1. Therefore, any common divisor of ac and bc must divide c. Wait, let me think again. 

Let me consider that since gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a, b) = 1 implies that gcd(a, b) = 1. Therefore, if d divides ac and d divides bc, then d divides c. 

Alternatively, suppose that d divides ac and d divides bc. Then, since gcd(a, b) = 1, then there exists integers x and y such that ax + by = 1. Then multiplying both sides by c gives axc + byc = c. Since d divides ac and d divides bc, then d divides axc + byc = c. Therefore, d divides c. 

Yes, that seems to work. 

Let me verify with an example. Let a = 2, b = 3, which are coprime. Let c = 4. Suppose d divides 2*4 = 8 and d divides 3*4 = 12. Then d divides gcd(8, 12) = 4. So d divides 4. But according to the statement, d should divide c = 4. Which is true. If d divides 8 and 12, then d divides 4. So yes, in this case, d divides c. 

Another example: a = 3, b = 5, c = 7. Then ac = 21, bc = 35. Then gcd(21, 35) = 7, which divides c = 7. 

Another example: suppose d divides ac and bc. Let me take d = 7. If a = 3, b = 5, c = 7. Then 7 divides 21 and 35, and 7 divides c. 

But suppose a = 2, b = 3, c = 6. Then d divides 12 and 18, so d divides 6. Which is c. So yes. 

So the logic is that if d divides both ac and bc, then since a and b are coprime, any common divisor of ac and bc must divide c. 

Therefore, part (e) is confirmed. 

Part (f): If gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a², b²) = 1. 

The hint says to first show that gcd(a, b²) = 1 and gcd(a², b) = 1. Let me think. 

First, if gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a, b²) = 1. Let me see. Suppose that gcd(a, b) = 1. Then any prime divisor of a cannot divide b. Therefore, since b² has the same prime factors as b, then gcd(a, b²) must be 1. Similarly, gcd(a², b) = 1. 

Then, if we can show that gcd(a², b²) = 1. Suppose that there is a prime p that divides both a² and b². Then p divides a and p divides b. Therefore, p divides gcd(a, b), which is 1. Therefore, no such prime exists. Hence, gcd(a², b²) = 1. 

Alternatively, using the hint. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a, b²) = 1. Similarly, gcd(a², b) = 1. Then, using the property that gcd(a², b²) = gcd(a, b²) * gcd(a², b) / gcd(a, b)? Wait, not sure. Maybe not. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b²) = 1, then gcd(a², b²) divides gcd(a, b²) * gcd(a², b). Wait, not sure. Let me think. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b²) = 1, then gcd(a², b²) = gcd(a², b²). Let me use the property that gcd(a², b²) = gcd(a, b)². Wait, but if gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a², b²) = 1² = 1. 

But how to prove that? 

Alternatively, if I can show that gcd(a², b²) divides gcd(a, b)². Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. 

Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then any common divisor of a² and b² must divide a and b. Because suppose d divides a² and b². Then d divides a² and d divides b². Then, since d divides a², any prime factor of d divides a, and similarly divides b. Therefore, d divides gcd(a, b) = 1. Therefore, d = 1. Therefore, gcd(a², b²) = 1. 

Alternatively, using the hint. Let me first show that gcd(a, b²) = 1. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then there are no primes dividing both a and b. Therefore, no primes divide both a and b². Therefore, gcd(a, b²) = 1. Similarly, gcd(a², b) = 1. 

Now, suppose that gcd(a², b²) = d. Then d divides a² and d divides b². Then, since d divides a², any prime factor of d divides a. Similarly, any prime factor of d divides b. Therefore, d divides gcd(a, b) = 1. Therefore, d = 1. 

Alternatively, if we use the property that gcd(a², b²) = gcd(a, b)². Since gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(a², b²) = 1² = 1. 

But maybe the hint is suggesting to use that gcd(a, b²) = 1 and gcd(a², b) = 1. Let me think. If I can show that gcd(a², b²) divides both gcd(a, b²) and gcd(a², b), but since they are both 1, then gcd(a², b²) divides 1, hence equals 1. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a², b²) divides a² and b². Since gcd(a, b²) = 1, then gcd(a², b²) divides gcd(a², b²) and gcd(a, b²) = 1. Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, since gcd(a, b²) = 1, then gcd(a², b²) divides gcd(a, b²) * gcd(a², b). Wait, not sure. 

But regardless, the key idea is that if a and b are coprime, then their squares are also coprime. Because if there was a common divisor of a² and b², it would have to divide both a and b, hence be 1. 

Therefore, part (f) is confirmed. 

Let me just recap all parts to make sure I didn't miss anything. 

(a) Used the linear combination to show that gcd(a, bc) = 1. 

(b) Used the fact that if c divides a and gcd(a, b) = 1, then any common divisor of b and c must divide 1. 

(c) Showed that gcd(ac, b) divides gcd(c, b) and vice versa. 

(d) Used the fact that gcd(a, c) divides b and since gcd(a, b) = 1, it must be 1. 

(e) Used the linear combination of ax + by = 1 to show that d divides c. 

(f) Used the fact that if a and b are coprime, then their squares are coprime. 

All parts seem to check out. 

**Final Answer**

(a) $\boxed{1}$

(b) $\boxed{1}$

(c) $\boxed{1}$

(d) $\boxed{1}$

(e) $\boxed{1}$

(f) $\boxed{1}$

Wait, but the question says "Confirm the following properties of the greatest common divisor" and each part asks to confirm that the gcd is 1 or something. But the way the questions are phrased, for example, (a) says gcd(a, bc) = 1, so the answer is 1. However, the user might expect the answers to be boxed as per each part. However, since the original question is to confirm the properties, and each part is a statement that needs to be confirmed, but the user might want the final answers boxed as per each part. However, in the initial problem statement, the user might expect each part's answer to be boxed. But looking at the original problem, the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Since there are multiple parts, but in the initial problem, the user might want each part's conclusion boxed. However, since each part is a statement, and the answer is that the gcd equals 1 or something, but the exact answer for each part is 1? Wait, no. For example, part (a) is "gcd(a, bc) = 1", so the answer is that it's equal to 1, so boxed 1. Similarly for others
