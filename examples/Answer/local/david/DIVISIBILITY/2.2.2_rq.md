Okay, so I need to show that any integer of the form 6k + 5 is also of the form 3j + 2, but the reverse isn't true. Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking.

First, let me recall that integers can be classified based on their remainders when divided by a certain number. For example, modulo 3, integers can be 0, 1, or 2. Similarly, modulo 6, they can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, the problem is about converting between these forms.

The first part is to show that if an integer is of the form 6k + 5, then it can also be expressed as 3j + 2 for some integer j. Let me try to manipulate the expression 6k + 5 to see if I can write it in terms of 3j + 2.

Let me think. If I have 6k + 5, I can note that 6k is equal to 3*(2k). So, 6k + 5 = 3*(2k) + 5. Now, if I want to write this as 3j + 2, then I need to adjust the constants. Let me subtract 3 from 5, which gives me 2. So, 3*(2k) + 5 = 3*(2k) + 3 + 2 = 3*(2k + 1) + 2. Therefore, if I let j = 2k + 1, then 6k + 5 = 3j + 2. That seems to work. Let me check with a specific example. Let's take k = 0. Then 6*0 + 5 = 5. Now, if j = 2*0 + 1 = 1, then 3*1 + 2 = 5. That works. Another example: k = 1. 6*1 + 5 = 11. Then j = 2*1 + 1 = 3. 3*3 + 2 = 11. Perfect. So, this shows that any number of the form 6k + 5 can be written as 3j + 2. So that part seems okay.

Now, the second part is to show that the converse is not true. That is, not every number of the form 3j + 2 can be written as 6k + 5. So, I need to find a number that is of the form 3j + 2 but not of the form 6k + 5. Let me think about how numbers of the form 3j + 2 look.

Numbers congruent to 2 mod 3. So, numbers like 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, etc. Now, numbers of the form 6k + 5 are numbers congruent to 5 mod 6. Let me check their congruence mod 3. Since 6k is divisible by 3, 6k + 5 ≡ 0 + 5 ≡ 2 mod 3. So, numbers of the form 6k + 5 are exactly the numbers congruent to 2 mod 3, but with an additional constraint. Wait, but numbers congruent to 2 mod 3 can be written as 3j + 2, where j can be any integer. However, numbers of the form 6k + 5 are numbers congruent to 2 mod 3 but with k being an integer, so they are numbers congruent to 2 mod 3 that are also congruent to 5 mod 6. Wait, maybe I need to think about this differently.

Alternatively, since 6k + 5 is equivalent to 3*(2k) + 5, which is 3*(2k) + 3 + 2 = 3*(2k + 1) + 2. Therefore, numbers of the form 6k + 5 are numbers that are 2 mod 3 and also odd? Wait, let me check. Let me take 6k + 5. Since 6k is even (because 6 is even) and 5 is odd, so even + odd = odd. Therefore, numbers of the form 6k + 5 are all odd numbers congruent to 2 mod 3. Wait, but numbers congruent to 2 mod 3 can be both even and odd? Let me check. For example, 2 is even and 2 mod 3. 5 is odd and 2 mod 3. 8 is even and 2 mod 3. 11 is odd and 2 mod 3. So, numbers congruent to 2 mod 3 alternate between even and odd. Therefore, numbers of the form 6k + 5 are specifically the odd numbers congruent to 2 mod 3. Therefore, the converse is not true because there are even numbers congruent to 2 mod 3, which cannot be expressed as 6k + 5.

Wait, let me verify that. Let me take a number that is 2 mod 3 and even. For example, 8. Is 8 of the form 6k + 5? Let's solve 6k + 5 = 8. Then 6k = 3, so k = 0.5. Which is not an integer. Therefore, 8 cannot be expressed as 6k + 5. Therefore, 8 is of the form 3j + 2 (since 8 = 3*2 + 2) but not of the form 6k + 5. Therefore, that's a counterexample. Hence, the converse is not true.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of congruence classes. Let me note that 6k + 5 ≡ 5 mod 6. Therefore, numbers of the form 6k + 5 are numbers congruent to 5 mod 6. On the other hand, numbers of the form 3j + 2 are numbers congruent to 2 mod 3. Since 5 mod 6 is equivalent to 2 mod 3 (since 5 divided by 3 is 1 with remainder 2), so numbers congruent to 5 mod 6 are a subset of numbers congruent to 2 mod 3. Therefore, every number congruent to 5 mod 6 is congruent to 2 mod 3, but not every number congruent to 2 mod 3 is congruent to 5 mod 6. Therefore, the converse is not true.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the forms. Let me suppose that 3j + 2 = 6k + 5. Then, rearranging, 3j - 6k = 5 - 2 = 3. Therefore, 3(j - 2k) = 3. Therefore, j - 2k = 1. Therefore, j = 2k + 1. Therefore, this shows that if 3j + 2 = 6k + 5, then j must be equal to 2k + 1. Therefore, this suggests that every number of the form 3j + 2 that is also of the form 6k + 5 must have j = 2k + 1. However, not all numbers of the form 3j + 2 can be written in this way. For example, if I take j = 0, then 3*0 + 2 = 2. Let me see if 2 can be written as 6k + 5. Then 6k + 5 = 2 => 6k = -3 => k = -0.5, which is not an integer. Therefore, 2 cannot be written as 6k + 5. Therefore, even though 2 is of the form 3j + 2, it's not of the form 6k + 5. Therefore, the converse is not true.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about parity. Since 6k + 5 is always odd (as 6k is even and 5 is odd), while numbers of the form 3j + 2 can be both even and odd. For example, if j is even, say j = 2m, then 3*(2m) + 2 = 6m + 2, which is even. If j is odd, say j = 2m + 1, then 3*(2m + 1) + 2 = 6m + 5, which is odd. Therefore, numbers of the form 3j + 2 include both even and odd numbers. However, numbers of the form 6k + 5 are always odd. Therefore, the even numbers of the form 3j + 2 cannot be expressed as 6k + 5. Therefore, the converse is not true because there are numbers of the form 3j + 2 that are even and thus cannot be expressed as 6k + 5.

So, putting it all together: any number of the form 6k + 5 is odd and congruent to 2 mod 3, so it can be written as 3j + 2 where j is odd (since j = 2k + 1). However, numbers of the form 3j + 2 can be even or odd, so not all of them are odd, hence not all can be written as 6k + 5.

Therefore, the first part is proven by expressing 6k + 5 as 3*(2k + 1) + 2, and the second part is shown by counterexamples like 2 or 8, which are of the form 3j + 2 but not of the form 6k + 5.

Wait, but let me check another example. Let me take j = 1, which gives 3*1 + 2 = 5, which is 6*0 + 5. So that works. j = 2 gives 3*2 + 2 = 8, which is not 6k + 5. So, that's a counterexample. Similarly, j = 3 gives 11, which is 6*1 + 5. So, alternating between being expressible and not. So, the numbers of the form 3j + 2 where j is odd can be written as 6k + 5, but when j is even, they can't. Therefore, the converse is not true because there are numbers of the form 3j + 2 (specifically, those where j is even) that cannot be written as 6k + 5.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the set of numbers of the form 6k + 5 is a subset of numbers of the form 3j + 2, but not the other way around.

So, to recap:

1. For any integer k, 6k + 5 = 3*(2k) + 5 = 3*(2k + 1) + 2. Therefore, if we let j = 2k + 1, then 6k + 5 = 3j + 2. Hence, every number of the form 6k + 5 is of the form 3j + 2.

2. To show the converse is not true, we can take a number of the form 3j + 2 that is not of the form 6k + 5. For example, take j = 0: 3*0 + 2 = 2. Suppose 2 = 6k + 5. Then 6k = -3, so k = -0.5, which is not an integer. Therefore, 2 is not of the form 6k + 5. Similarly, take j = 2: 3*2 + 2 = 8. Suppose 8 = 6k + 5. Then 6k = 3, so k = 0.5, not integer. Hence, 8 is not of the form 6k + 5. Therefore, the converse does not hold.

Alternatively, since numbers of the form 6k + 5 are odd numbers congruent to 2 mod 3, while numbers of the form 3j + 2 include both even and odd numbers, the converse is not true because there are even numbers in the form 3j + 2 that are not of the form 6k + 5.

Therefore, the proof is complete.

**Final Answer**
Any integer of the form $6k + 5$ can be expressed as $3j + 2$ but not conversely. This is demonstrated by the transformation $6k + 5 = 3(2k + 1) + 2$ and counterexamples like $2$ or $8$ which are of the form $3j + 2$ but not $6k + 5$. Thus, the statement is proven, and the final answer is \boxed{2} as a representative counterexample, though the question doesn't require a specific boxed answer. However, following the instructions, the final answer should be boxed, so I will box the key conclusion.

But the original question says "Show that...", so maybe the user expects a conclusion. However, since the problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", but the problem is a proof, not a calculation. Maybe the user expects the boxed answer to be the counterexample? But the question is to show the statement, not to provide a numerical answer. However, in some cases, problems like this might expect a specific number as a counterexample, but the original problem doesn't specify. Since the user instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", but the answer is a proof, perhaps the user expects the boxed answer to be the counterexample. However, the initial problem is to show that any integer of the form 6k + 5 is also of the form 3j + 2 but not conversely. Since there is no single answer, but the user might have expected the counterexample, but since the original problem is a proof, maybe the answer is just confirming the statement. However, given the instructions, I think the user might have intended the answer to be the counterexample. But since the problem is to show the statement, maybe the answer is just the statement. However, in the absence of specific instructions, and given the initial problem, perhaps the user expects the answer to be boxed as the counterexample, but since the user might not have intended that. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the statement itself, but in the context of the problem, maybe the answer is the number 2 or 5 or something. Wait, the original problem says "Show that...", so maybe there's no single answer. However, the user might have wanted the answer to be the conclusion, which is that the converse is not true, but since the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", maybe they want the boxed answer to be the number that is of the form 3j + 2 but not 6k + 5, like 2 or 8. Since the problem says "not conversely", so maybe the answer is \boxed{2} as an example. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the answer to be the statement, but since the user is using the problem from a textbook or something, maybe they want the answer to be \boxed{2} as a counterexample. Given that, I think the safest way is to box the counterexample, which is 2.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2}

To show that any integer of the form $ 6k + 5 $ is also of the form $ 3j + 2 $, but the converse is not true, we analyze the structure of these expressions and their congruences modulo 3 and 6.

---

### **Part 1: $ 6k + 5 $ can be written as $ 3j + 2 $**

Start with the expression:

$$
6k + 5
$$

We can factor out 3 from the $ 6k $ term:

$$
6k + 5 = 3(2k) + 5
$$

Now, rewrite 5 as $ 3 + 2 $:

$$
3(2k) + 5 = 3(2k) + 3 + 2 = 3(2k + 1) + 2
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
6k + 5 = 3(2k + 1) + 2
$$

Let $ j = 2k + 1 $, which is an integer for any integer $ k $. Therefore, we can write:

$$
6k + 5 = 3j + 2
$$

This shows that **any integer of the form $ 6k + 5 $ is also of the form $ 3j + 2 $**.

---

### **Part 2: The converse is not true**

Now consider the reverse: suppose an integer is of the form $ 3j + 2 $. Is it necessarily of the form $ 6k + 5 $?

To test this, let’s examine specific examples of numbers of the form $ 3j + 2 $:

- $ j = 0 \Rightarrow 3(0) + 2 = 2 $
- $ j = 1 \Rightarrow 3(1) + 2 = 5 $
- $ j = 2 \Rightarrow 3(2) + 2 = 8 $
- $ j = 3 \Rightarrow 3(3) + 2 = 11 $

Now, check if these can be written as $ 6k + 5 $:

- $ 2 = 6k + 5 \Rightarrow 6k = -3 \Rightarrow k = -0.5 $ (not an integer)
- $ 8 = 6k + 5 \Rightarrow 6k = 3 \Rightarrow k = 0.5 $ (not an integer)

So, **some numbers of the form $ 3j + 2 $ cannot be written as $ 6k + 5 $**. For example, $ 2 $ and $ 8 $ are of the form $ 3j + 2 $, but not of the form $ 6k + 5 $.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **All** integers of the form $ 6k + 5 $ are of the form $ 3j + 2 $, since we can always express them as $ 3(2k + 1) + 2 $.
- **Not all** integers of the form $ 3j + 2 $ are of the form $ 6k + 5 $, as shown by counterexamples like $ 2 $ or $ 8 $.

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{2}
$$
