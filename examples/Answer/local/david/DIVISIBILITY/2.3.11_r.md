 To verify this, we will use the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd).

First, let's consider $gcd(a, b)$. By definition, this is the largest integer that divides both $a$ and $b$ without leaving a remainder.

Next, let's consider $gcd(-a, b)$. Since $-a$ is just $a$ multiplied by $-1$, any divisor of $a$ is also a divisor of $-a$. Therefore, the gcd of $-a$ and $b$ is the same as the gcd of $a$ and $b$.

Similarly, for $gcd(a, -b)$, any divisor of $b$ is also a divisor of $-b$. Therefore, the gcd of $a$ and $-b$ is the same as the gcd of $a$ and $b$.

Finally, for $gcd(-a, -b)$, since both $-a$ and $-b$ are just $a$ and $b$ multiplied by $-1$, the gcd of $-a$ and $-b$ is the same as the gcd of $a$ and $b$.

Therefore, we have verified that $gcd(a, b) = gcd(-a, b) = gcd(a, -b) = gcd(-a, -b)$.
