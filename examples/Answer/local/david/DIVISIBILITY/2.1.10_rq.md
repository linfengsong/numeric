Okay, so I need to prove that the nth pentagonal number, which is defined recursively as p₁ = 1 and pₙ = pₙ₋₁ + (3n - 2) for n ≥ 2, is equal to the formula n(3n - 1)/2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, since the problem gives a recursive definition, maybe I can use mathematical induction to prove the formula. That seems like a solid approach. Alternatively, maybe I can expand the recursive formula and find a closed-form expression. Let me try both approaches and see which one works better.

Starting with induction. For induction, I need to verify the base case and then assume it's true for some k and show it's true for k + 1.

Base case: n = 1. According to the formula, p₁ should be 1(3*1 - 1)/2 = (1*2)/2 = 1. Which matches the given p₁ = 1. So the base case holds.

Now, assume that for some integer k ≥ 1, pₖ = k(3k - 1)/2. Now, we need to show that pₖ₊₁ = (k + 1)(3(k + 1) - 1)/2.

From the recursive definition, pₖ₊₁ = pₖ + (3(k + 1) - 2) = pₖ + (3k + 3 - 2) = pₖ + 3k + 1.

Using the induction hypothesis, substitute pₖ:

pₖ₊₁ = [k(3k - 1)/2] + 3k + 1.

Let me compute that:

First, expand the terms:

= [ (3k² - k)/2 ] + 3k + 1

To combine these terms, I need a common denominator. Let me convert 3k + 1 into halves:

= (3k² - k)/2 + (6k)/2 + 2/2

Now combine all terms:

= [3k² - k + 6k + 2]/2

Simplify the numerator:

3k² + 5k + 2

So pₖ₊₁ = (3k² + 5k + 2)/2.

Now, let me check if this is equal to the formula for pₖ₊₁, which is (k + 1)(3(k + 1) - 1)/2.

Compute the formula:

(k + 1)(3(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)(3k + 3 - 1) = (k + 1)(3k + 2)

Multiply that out:

= 3k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1) = 3k² + 3k + 2k + 2 = 3k² + 5k + 2

Which is exactly the numerator we had earlier. Therefore, pₖ₊₁ = (3k² + 5k + 2)/2 = (k + 1)(3k + 2)/2, which matches the formula. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1.

Wait, so that's the induction proof. But maybe I should also try expanding the recursive formula directly, just to see if I can get the same result. Let me try that approach as well.

Given that pₙ = pₙ₋₁ + (3n - 2). Starting from p₁ = 1, let's write out the terms:

p₁ = 1

p₂ = p₁ + 3*2 - 2 = 1 + 6 - 2 = 5

p₃ = p₂ + 3*3 - 2 = 5 + 9 - 2 = 12

p₄ = 12 + 3*4 - 2 = 12 + 12 - 2 = 22

Which matches the numbers given in the problem statement. Now, if I want to find a closed-form formula, I can expand the recursive relation.

Since pₙ = pₙ₋₁ + (3n - 2), this is a linear recurrence relation. To find pₙ, we can express it as the sum of the initial term plus the sum of the increments from k=2 to n.

So, pₙ = p₁ + Σ (from k=2 to n) [3k - 2]

Since p₁ = 1, then:

pₙ = 1 + Σ (from k=2 to n) [3k - 2]

Alternatively, we can adjust the summation indices to start from k=1. Let me write that:

Σ (from k=2 to n) [3k - 2] = Σ (from k=1 to n) [3k - 2] - [3*1 - 2] = Σ (from k=1 to n) [3k - 2] - (3 - 2) = Σ (from k=1 to n) [3k - 2] - 1

Therefore, pₙ = 1 + [Σ (from k=1 to n) (3k - 2) - 1] = Σ (from k=1 to n) (3k - 2)

So pₙ = Σ (from k=1 to n) (3k - 2). Let me compute this sum.

First, split the sum into two parts:

Σ (from k=1 to n) 3k - Σ (from k=1 to n) 2 = 3 Σ (from k=1 to n) k - 2 Σ (from k=1 to n) 1

Compute each sum:

Σ (from k=1 to n) k = n(n + 1)/2

Σ (from k=1 to n) 1 = n

Therefore,

pₙ = 3*(n(n + 1)/2) - 2*n = (3n(n + 1))/2 - 2n

Let me simplify this expression:

First, expand 3n(n + 1)/2:

= (3n² + 3n)/2 - 2n

Convert 2n to halves to combine:

= (3n² + 3n)/2 - (4n)/2 = [3n² + 3n - 4n]/2 = [3n² - n]/2 = n(3n - 1)/2

Which is exactly the formula we needed to prove! So that's another way to derive it by expanding the recurrence relation. Therefore, regardless of the approach, we arrive at the formula pₙ = n(3n - 1)/2.

Therefore, the formula is proven both by induction and by expanding the recursive definition. Let me check if there's another way, maybe using the general formula for quadratic sequences or something else, but I think these two methods are sufficient.

Wait, just to be thorough, let me check with n=2,3,4 using the formula.

For n=2: 2*(3*2 -1)/2 = 2*(6 -1)/2 = 2*5/2 = 5. Correct.

n=3: 3*(9 -1)/2 = 3*8/2 = 12. Correct.

n=4: 4*(12 -1)/2 = 4*11/2 = 22. Correct. So the formula works for the first few terms.

Therefore, both methods confirm that the formula holds. Thus, the proof is complete.

**Final Answer**
The nth pentagonal number is given by \boxed{\dfrac{n(3n - 1)}{2}}.

To prove that the $ n $-th pentagonal number $ p_n $, defined recursively by

$$
p_1 = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad p_n = p_{n-1} + (3n - 2) \quad \text{for } n \geq 2,
$$

is given by the closed-form formula

$$
p_n = \frac{n(3n - 1)}{2},
$$

we can use either **mathematical induction** or **direct summation of the recurrence**. Let's explore both approaches in detail.

### **Approach 1: Mathematical Induction**

**Base Case:**  
For $ n = 1 $,  
$$
p_1 = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1(3 \cdot 1 - 1)}{2} = \frac{1 \cdot 2}{2} = 1.
$$
So the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**  
Assume that the formula holds for some integer $ k \geq 1 $, i.e.,  
$$
p_k = \frac{k(3k - 1)}{2}.
$$
We now show that it also holds for $ k+1 $:

Using the recurrence relation:
$$
p_{k+1} = p_k + (3(k+1) - 2) = p_k + (3k + 1).
$$
Substitute the inductive hypothesis:
$$
p_{k+1} = \frac{k(3k - 1)}{2} + (3k + 1).
$$
Combine terms:
$$
p_{k+1} = \frac{3k^2 - k}{2} + 3k + 1.
$$
Write $ 3k + 1 $ with a denominator of 2:
