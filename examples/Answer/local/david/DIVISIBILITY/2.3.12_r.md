 To prove that gcd(a, a + n) divides n, we can use the property of greatest common divisors (gcd) that if d divides both a and b, then d divides their difference, a - b.

Let d = gcd(a, a + n). Since d divides both a and a + n, it also divides their difference, which is n. Therefore, d divides n.

Now, we want to show that gcd(a, a + 1) = 1. Since 1 is a divisor of any integer, we can use the result we just proved. We know that gcd(a, a + 1) divides 1. The only divisors of 1 are 1 and -1, but since gcd(a, a + 1) is a positive integer, it must be 1.

Therefore, gcd(a, a + 1) = 1.
