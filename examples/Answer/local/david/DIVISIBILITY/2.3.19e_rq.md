Okay, so I need to prove that for any integer a, 360 divides a²(a² - 1)(a² - 4). Let me start by understanding what this means. The problem is saying that no matter what integer a I pick, when I compute this product a²(a² - 1)(a² - 4), it should be divisible by 360. 

First, let me recall that 360 can be factored into prime factors. Let me do that. 360 is 36 * 10, which is 6² * 10. Breaking it down further into primes: 6 is 2 * 3, and 10 is 2 * 5. So, 360 = 2³ * 3² * 5. Therefore, to show that 360 divides the product, I need to show that the product is divisible by 8, 9, and 5. Because 8, 9, and 5 are the prime power components of 360, and they are pairwise coprime. So if I can show that the product is divisible by each of these, then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem or just the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, it will be divisible by their product, which is 360. 

So, my plan is to check divisibility by 8, 9, and 5 separately. Let me tackle each one step by step.

Starting with divisibility by 5. Let me think. For the product a²(a² - 1)(a² - 4) to be divisible by 5, at least one of the factors must be divisible by 5. So, I need to show that for any integer a, one of a², a² - 1, or a² - 4 is divisible by 5. 

Let me consider the possible residues of a modulo 5. Since we are dealing with squares, maybe I can analyze the possible quadratic residues modulo 5. The quadratic residues modulo 5 are 0²=0, 1²=1, 2²=4, 3²=9≡4, 4²=16≡1. So the quadratic residues modulo 5 are 0, 1, 4. Therefore, a² mod 5 can be 0, 1, or 4. 

Now, let me check for each possible residue of a² mod 5:

Case 1: a² ≡ 0 mod 5. Then, the term a² is divisible by 5. So the entire product is divisible by 5.

Case 2: a² ≡ 1 mod 5. Then, the term (a² - 1) ≡ 0 mod 5. Therefore, the product is divisible by 5.

Case 3: a² ≡ 4 mod 5. Then, the term (a² - 4) ≡ 0 mod 5. Therefore, the product is divisible by 5.

So, in all cases, the product is divisible by 5. Therefore, the product is divisible by 5. Great, that's done.

Now moving on to divisibility by 9. Let me think. The product needs to be divisible by 9, which is 3². So, I need to ensure that the product has at least two factors of 3. Let me analyze the factors again. The product is a²(a² - 1)(a² - 4). Let me consider the possible residues of a modulo 3. 

First, quadratic residues modulo 3 are 0²=0, 1²=1, 2²=4≡1. So, quadratic residues modulo 3 are 0 and 1. Therefore, a² mod 3 can be 0 or 1. 

Let me check each case:

Case 1: a ≡ 0 mod 3. Then, a² ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, the term a² is divisible by 3. But we need divisibility by 9. So, if a is divisible by 3, then a² is divisible by 9. Therefore, the product will have a factor of 9 from a². 

Case 2: a ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3. Then, a² ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. So, the term (a² - 1) is divisible by 3. However, we need to check if it's divisible by 9. Let me think. If a² ≡ 1 mod 3, then a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3. But how much is it divisible by? Let me check for divisibility by 9. 

Let me consider a ≡ 1 mod 3. Let me write a = 3k + 1. Then, a² = 9k² + 6k + 1. Therefore, a² - 1 = 9k² + 6k = 3k(3k + 2). So, this is divisible by 3, but not necessarily by 9. Similarly, if a ≡ 2 mod 3, then a = 3k + 2. Then, a² = 9k² + 12k + 4, so a² - 1 = 9k² + 12k + 3 = 3(3k² + 4k + 1). Again, divisible by 3 but not necessarily by 9. 

Therefore, if a is not divisible by 3, then (a² - 1) is divisible by 3, but only once. However, we need to have two factors of 3. So, maybe there is another term that contributes another factor of 3? Let me check the other terms. 

The other terms are a² and a² - 4. Let me check if they can contribute more factors. 

If a ≡ 1 mod 3, then a² ≡ 1 mod 3, so a² - 4 ≡ 1 - 4 ≡ -3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Wait, so if a² ≡ 1 mod 3, then a² - 4 ≡ 1 - 4 = -3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, in this case, both (a² - 1) and (a² - 4) are divisible by 3. Similarly, if a ≡ 2 mod 3, then a² ≡ 1 mod 3, so a² - 4 ≡ 1 - 4 = -3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, again, both (a² - 1) and (a² - 4) are divisible by 3. 

Therefore, when a is not divisible by 3, then both (a² - 1) and (a² - 4) are divisible by 3. Therefore, the product would have two factors of 3. Let me check that. 

So, if a ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3, then (a² - 1) and (a² - 4) are both divisible by 3. Therefore, the product would have two factors of 3. Therefore, in this case, the product is divisible by 3² = 9. 

If a ≡ 0 mod 3, then a² is divisible by 9. Therefore, the product is divisible by 9. 

Therefore, in all cases, the product is divisible by 9. 

So, that's good. So divisibility by 9 is covered. 

Now, moving on to divisibility by 8. Let me think. The product needs to be divisible by 8. So, we need to show that the product a²(a² - 1)(a² - 4) is divisible by 8. Let me analyze this. 

First, note that 8 is 2³. So, we need the product to have at least three factors of 2. Let me consider the possible residues of a modulo 8 or maybe modulo something else. Alternatively, perhaps consider parity and other properties. Let me think. 

Alternatively, since we are dealing with a², let me think about the possible values of a² modulo 8. The squares modulo 8 are as follows:

0² = 0 mod 8

1² = 1 mod 8

2² = 4 mod 8

3² = 9 ≡ 1 mod 8

4² = 16 ≡ 0 mod 8

5² = 25 ≡ 1 mod 8

6² = 36 ≡ 4 mod 8

7² = 49 ≡ 1 mod 8

So, quadratic residues modulo 8 are 0, 1, 4. Therefore, a² mod 8 can be 0, 1, or 4. 

Therefore, depending on a's residue mod 8, a² is 0, 1, or 4. Let me analyze each case. 

Case 1: a is even. Then, a is divisible by 2. Let me check if a is divisible by 4 or 2. 

But maybe instead of splitting into cases, let me think about the product. Let me note that a², a² - 1, and a² - 4. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the parity of a. Let me think. 

But maybe it's better to analyze the factors. Let me note that a² and a² - 1 are consecutive integers? Wait, no. Wait, a² and a² - 1 are consecutive integers. Similarly, a² - 4 is two less than a². 

Wait, but maybe I can think of the product as follows: Let me denote b = a². Then, the product is b(b - 1)(b - 4). So, we need to show that this product is divisible by 8. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the product in terms of consecutive numbers. However, since b, b - 1, and b - 4 are not necessarily consecutive. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider different cases based on the value of a mod something. Let me think. Since we need to check divisibility by 8, maybe considering modulo 8 is helpful. 

But since a² mod 8 can be 0, 1, or 4, let me consider each case. 

Case 1: a² ≡ 0 mod 8. Then, a is divisible by 4 (since if a² is divisible by 8, then a must be divisible by 4). Therefore, a = 4k. Then, let me compute the product:

a² = 16k² ≡ 0 mod 8.

a² - 1 = 16k² - 1 ≡ -1 mod 8.

a² - 4 = 16k² - 4 ≡ -4 mod 8.

Therefore, the product is 0 * (-1) * (-4) = 0 mod 8. Therefore, divisible by 8.

Case 2: a² ≡ 1 mod 8. Then, a is odd. Let me check. Since a² ≡ 1 mod 8 implies that a is odd. Let me compute the product:

a² = 1 mod 8.

a² - 1 = 0 mod 8.

a² - 4 = 1 - 4 = -3 ≡ 5 mod 8.

Therefore, the product is 1 * 0 * 5 = 0 mod 8. Therefore, divisible by 8.

Case 3: a² ≡ 4 mod 8. Then, a is even but not divisible by 4. Because if a is divisible by 2 but not by 4, then a = 2k where k is odd. Then, a² = 4k². Since k is odd, k² ≡ 1 mod 2, so 4k² ≡ 4 mod 8. Therefore, a² ≡ 4 mod 8. 

So, in this case, a² = 4 mod 8. Then, compute the product:

a² = 4 mod 8.

a² - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 mod 8.

a² - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0 mod 8.

Therefore, the product is 4 * 3 * 0 = 0 mod 8. Therefore, divisible by 8.

Therefore, in all cases, the product is divisible by 8. 

Therefore, since the product is divisible by 8, 9, and 5, which are pairwise coprime, the product is divisible by 8 * 9 * 5 = 360. Therefore, 360 divides the product. 

Wait, but let me check if there is any overlap or if I need to consider more carefully. For example, when a is even, maybe there are multiple factors of 2. But since we have already shown that in each case, the product is divisible by 8, regardless of the case, then it's okay. 

But let me test with some examples to make sure. Let me pick some integers and check. 

Take a = 0: Then, the product is 0²*(0² - 1)*(0² - 4) = 0 * (-1) * (-4) = 0. 0 is divisible by any number, so that's okay.

Take a = 1: 1²*(1 - 1)*(1 - 4) = 1 * 0 * (-3) = 0. Divisible by 360.

a = 2: 4*(4 - 1)*(4 - 4) = 4 * 3 * 0 = 0. Divisible by 360.

a = 3: 9*(9 - 1)*(9 - 4) = 9*8*5 = 360. Which is exactly 360. So 360 divides 360. 

a = 4: 16*(16 - 1)*(16 - 4) = 16 * 15 * 12. Let me compute that. 16 * 15 = 240, 240 * 12 = 2880. 2880 divided by 360 is 8. So yes, divisible.

a = 5: 25*(25 - 1)*(25 - 4) = 25*24*21. Let me compute 25*24 = 600, 600*21 = 12600. 12600 / 360 = 35. So yes.

a = 6: 36*(36 - 1)*(36 - 4) = 36 * 35 * 32. 36 * 35 = 1260, 1260 * 32 = 40320. 40320 / 360 = 112. So yes.

a = -1: same as a = 1, since it's squared. So same result.

a = 7: 49*(49 - 1)*(49 - 4) = 49*48*45. Let me compute 49*48 = 2352, 2352*45. Let me divide by 360. 2352 / 360 = 6.533... but maybe better to factor. 49*48*45 = 49 * 48 * 45. 48 is divisible by 16 and 3, 45 is 9*5. So 49 is 7², 48 is 16*3, 45 is 9*5. Therefore, total factors: 16*3*9*5*7². 16 is 2⁴, 3 is 3, 9 is 3², 5 is 5, so total factors of 2: 4, factors of 3: 1 + 2 = 3, factors of 5: 1. But 360 is 2³ * 3² * 5. So, the product has 2⁴, 3³, 5, so definitely divisible by 2³, 3², 5. Therefore, yes.

Another example: a = 2. We saw earlier that it's zero. 

What about a = 3? 9*8*5 = 360. 

Another example: a = 4. 16*15*12. Let me check divisibility by 8, 9, 5. 

Divisible by 5? Yes, because 15 is divisible by 5.

Divisible by 9? 16 is 16, 15 is 15, 12 is 12. The product is 16*15*12. 15 is divisible by 3, 12 is divisible by 3, so total of two 3s. 16 is 2⁴, so divisible by 8. 

Yes, that works. 

Another example: a = 5. 25*24*21. Divisible by 5 (25), by 9? 24 is 24, 21 is 21. 24 has one 3, 21 has one 3, so total two 3s. Divisible by 8? 24 is divisible by 8? 24 / 8 = 3. Yes. So 24 is divisible by 8. Therefore, the product is divisible by 8, 9, and 5. 

Another example: a = 1. The product is 0, which is divisible by everything. 

a = 2: 4*3*0 = 0. 

a = 3: 9*8*5 = 360. 

a = 4: 16*15*12 = 2880. 2880 / 360 = 8. 

a = 5: 25*24*21 = 12600. 12600 / 360 = 35. 

a = 6: 36*35*32 = 40320.
