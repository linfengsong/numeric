 (a) 6x + 51y = 22.
The greatest common divisor of 6 and 51 is 3, which divides 22. So, the Diophantine equation 6x + 51y = 22 can be solved.

(b) 33x + 14y = 115.
The greatest common divisor of 33 and 14 is 1, which divides 115. So, the Diophantine equation 33x + 14y = 115 can be solved.

(c) 14x + 35y = 93.
The greatest common divisor of 14 and 35 is 7, which does not divide 93. So, the Diophantine equation 14x + 35y = 93 cannot be solved.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{(c)}$.
