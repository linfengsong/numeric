 To show that any integer of the form 6k + 5 is also of the form 3j + 2, we need to find a relationship between these two forms.

Let's consider an integer of the form 6k + 5. We can rewrite this as:

6k + 5 = 3(2k) + 2 + 3

Now, we can see that this integer is of the form 3j + 2, where j = 2k + 1.

Now, let's consider the converse, which is to show that any integer of the form 3j + 2 is also of the form 6k + 5.

Let's consider an integer of the form 3j + 2. We can rewrite this as:

3j + 2 = 3(j) + 2

However, we cannot directly express this integer in the form 6k + 5, as the coefficients of j in both forms are not the same. Therefore, we cannot conclude that any integer of the form 3j + 2 is also of the form 6k + 5.

In conclusion, we have shown that any integer of the form 6k + 5 is also of the form 3j + 2, but not conversely.
