Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of the reciprocals of the first n triangular numbers is less than 2. Let me start by recalling what triangular numbers are. The nth triangular number, t_n, is given by the formula t_n = n(n + 1)/2. So, the reciprocals would be 1/t_n = 2/[n(n + 1)]. 

The problem is asking about the sum S_n = 1/t_1 + 1/t_2 + ... + 1/t_n, which translates to S_n = 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/10 + ... + 2/[n(n + 1)]. I need to show that this sum is always less than 2, regardless of how large n is. 

First, maybe I can write out the first few terms and see if I can spot a pattern or find a telescoping series or something. Let me compute S_1, S_2, S_3, etc.

For n=1: S_1 = 1/t_1 = 1/1 = 1. Which is less than 2. 

For n=2: S_2 = 1 + 1/3 ≈ 1.333... Still less than 2.

For n=3: 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 ≈ 1 + 0.333 + 0.166 ≈ 1.5. Still less than 2.

n=4: Adding 1/10. So total ≈ 1.5 + 0.1 = 1.6.

n=5: 1/15 added. So ≈ 1.6 + 0.066... ≈ 1.666...

n=6: 1/21 ≈ 0.0476, so ≈ 1.714...

Continuing this way, it seems like the sum is increasing but approaching some limit. Maybe it approaches 2? But the problem says it's less than 2 for all n. So perhaps the sum converges to 2 as n approaches infinity? If that's the case, then for any finite n, the sum would be less than 2. But how do I prove that?

Alternatively, maybe I can use induction. Let me think. If I can show that S_n < 2 for all n, then maybe by induction. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can find a telescoping series. Since each term is 2/[n(n + 1)], which can be written as 2[1/n - 1/(n + 1)]. Wait, let me check that:

Let me recall that 1/[n(n + 1)] = 1/n - 1/(n + 1). Therefore, 2/[n(n + 1)] = 2[1/n - 1/(n + 1)]. So the sum S_n would be the sum from k=1 to n of 2[1/k - 1/(k + 1)].

So that's 2 times the sum from k=1 to n of [1/k - 1/(k + 1)]. Let me write that out:

S_n = 2 * [ (1/1 - 1/2) + (1/2 - 1/3) + (1/3 - 1/4) + ... + (1/n - 1/(n + 1)) ].

Now, if I expand this, most terms should cancel out. Let's see:

The first term is 1/1 - 1/2, then +1/2 -1/3, then +1/3 -1/4, etc. So the -1/2 cancels with +1/2, -1/3 cancels with +1/3, and so on. So all the intermediate terms cancel, and we are left with 1/1 - 1/(n + 1). Therefore, the entire sum becomes:

S_n = 2 * [1 - 1/(n + 1)] = 2 * [ (n + 1 - 1)/(n + 1) ) ] = 2 * [n / (n + 1)] = 2n / (n + 1).

Wait, so S_n = 2n / (n + 1). Then, since n is a positive integer, 2n/(n + 1) is less than 2. Because 2n/(n + 1) = 2 - 2/(n + 1). Therefore, since 2/(n + 1) is positive, subtracting it from 2 gives something less than 2. 

Therefore, the sum S_n = 2n/(n + 1) < 2 for all positive integers n. Therefore, the sum of reciprocals of the first n triangular numbers is less than 2. 

Wait, but hold on, let me check with the earlier examples. For n=1, S_1 = 2*1/(1 + 1) = 2/2 = 1, which matches. For n=2, 2*2/(2 + 1) = 4/3 ≈ 1.333..., which matches. For n=3, 2*3/4 = 6/4 = 1.5, which matches. So this formula seems correct. Therefore, the sum is exactly 2n/(n + 1), which is always less than 2. 

But then why does the problem say "the sum of the reciprocals of the first n triangular numbers is less than 2"? Because it's actually equal to 2n/(n + 1), which is less than 2. Therefore, the inequality holds for all n. 

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Let me recast the sum. 

Original sum S_n is sum_{k=1}^n 1/t_k = sum_{k=1}^n 2/[k(k + 1)] = 2 * sum_{k=1}^n [1/k - 1/(k + 1)].

Yes, that telescopes to 2*(1 - 1/(n + 1)) = 2*(n/(n + 1)) = 2n/(n + 1). 

Therefore, the sum is exactly 2n/(n + 1). Therefore, since 2n/(n + 1) = 2 - 2/(n + 1), which is less than 2 for all n ≥ 1. Therefore, the inequality holds. 

But then why is the problem presented as needing to be proven? Maybe the question is expecting a different approach? Or maybe there is a misunderstanding here? Let me check again. 

Wait, the triangular numbers are t_k = k(k + 1)/2, so reciprocal is 2/[k(k + 1)], which is correct. Then the sum from k=1 to n of 2/[k(k + 1)] is indeed telescoping. So the sum is 2*(1 - 1/(n + 1)) = 2n/(n + 1). Therefore, the sum is less than 2. 

Therefore, the problem is straightforward once you recognize the telescoping series. Maybe the problem is intended to be a simple telescoping sum problem. 

Alternatively, maybe the original problem is written as "the sum of reciprocals of the first n triangular numbers is less than 2", which is true because the sum is 2n/(n + 1), which approaches 2 as n approaches infinity. Therefore, for all finite n, it's less than 2. 

But perhaps the problem is in a context where the student is supposed to not know about telescoping series? Maybe they are supposed to use induction or another method? 

Alternatively, maybe I need to verify my telescoping approach again. Let me compute S_1 through S_4 using the formula and check. 

For n=1: 2*1/(1 + 1) = 1. Correct. 

For n=2: 2*2/(2 + 1) = 4/3 ≈ 1.333... Correct. 

For n=3: 6/4 = 1.5. Correct. 

For n=4: 8/5 = 1.6. Correct. 

So yes, the formula holds. Therefore, the sum is always less than 2. 

Therefore, the problem is solved by recognizing that the sum telescopes to 2n/(n + 1), which is less than 2. 

But maybe the original problem is presented in a way that the student is supposed to not know that the sum telescopes? For example, if someone doesn't recognize the telescoping nature, they might try to bound the sum. 

Alternatively, maybe there is an alternative approach. Let me think. 

Suppose I don't see the telescoping sum. How else could I approach this? 

Well, since each term is 2/[k(k + 1)], which is equal to 2*(1/k - 1/(k + 1)), so the sum telescopes. But if I didn't know that, maybe I could compare the sum to an integral or use induction. 

Alternatively, using induction. Let me try that. 

Base case n=1: S_1 = 1 < 2. True. 

Assume that for some n ≥ 1, S_n = 2n/(n + 1) < 2. Then S_{n + 1} = S_n + 1/t_{n + 1} = 2n/(n +
