 To show that a | gcd(a, b) gcd(a, c), we need to show that a is a divisor of the product of the greatest common divisors of a and b, and a and c.

First, let's recall the definition of the greatest common divisor (gcd): gcd(a, b) is the largest integer that divides both a and b.

Now, let's consider the given information that a | bd. This means that a divides the product of b and d.

We want to show that a | gcd(a, b) gcd(a, c). To do this, we can use the property of gcd that states gcd(a, b) gcd(a, c) = gcd(a, bc).

Now, we know that a | bd, and we want to show that a | gcd(a, b) gcd(a, c) = gcd(a, bc).

Since a | bd, we can say that there exists an integer k such that a * k = bd.

Now, let's consider the gcd(a, bc). Since a | bd, we can say that a is a divisor of bd. Therefore, a is also a divisor of gcd(a, bc) * k, because gcd(a, bc) * k = bd.

So, we have shown that a | gcd(a, b) gcd(a, c), as required.
