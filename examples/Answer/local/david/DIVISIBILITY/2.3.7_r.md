 To prove that $16 | a^4 + b^4 - 2$ for all odd integers $a$ and $b$, we can use the properties of odd numbers and the Binomial Theorem.

First, let's recall that an odd number can be represented as $2k + 1$, where $k$ is an integer. So, we can let $a = 2k_1 + 1$ and $b = 2k_2 + 1$, where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are integers.

Now, let's expand $(a^4 + b^4 - 2)$:

$a^4 + b^4 - 2 = (2k_1 + 1)^4 + (2k_2 + 1)^4 - 2$

Using the Binomial Theorem, we can expand $(2k_1 + 1)^4$ and $(2k_2 + 1)^4$:

$(2k_1 + 1)^4 = \sum_{i=0}^{4} \binom{4}{i} (2k_1)^i (1)^{4-i}$

$(2k_2 + 1)^4 = \sum_{j=0}^{4} \binom{4}{j} (2k_2)^j (1)^{4-j}$

Since we are only interested in the divisibility by 16, we can focus on the terms that are multiples of 16. Notice that the only terms in the expansions of $(2k_1 + 1)^4$ and $(2k_2 + 1)^4$ that are multiples of 16 are the terms with $i = 4$ and $j = 4$:

$(2k_1)^4$ and $(2k_2)^4$

So, we can rewrite the expression as:

$a^4 + b^4 - 2 = (2k_1)^4 + (2k_2)^4 - 2$

Now, we can factor out the common factor of 16:

$a^4 + b^4 - 2 = 16(k_1)^4 + 16(k_2)^4 - 2$

Since $k_1$ and $k_2$ are integers, $(k_1)^4$ and $(k_2)^4$ are also integers. Therefore, $16(k_1)^4 + 16(k_2)^4 - 2$ is an integer.

Finally, we need to show that $16 | (16(k_1)^4 + 16(k_2)^4 - 2)$. Since 16 is a factor of itself, we can conclude that $16 | (16(k_1)^4 + 16(k_2)^4 - 2)$.

Thus, we have proven that if $a$ and $b$ are both odd integers, then $16 | a^4 + b^4 - 2$.
