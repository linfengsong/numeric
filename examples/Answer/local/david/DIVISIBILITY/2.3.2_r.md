 (a) If a | b, then by definition there exists an integer k such that b = ak. Therefore, bc = a(kc), and since kc is an integer, a | bc.

(b) If a | b and a | c, then there exist integers k and m such that b = ak and c = am. Therefore, $bc = a^2km$, and since $a^2$, k, and m are all integers, $a^2 | bc$.

(c) If a | b, then there exists an integer k such that b = ak. Therefore, ac | bc, since ac = a(kc) and kc is an integer. Conversely, if ac | bc, then there exists an integer k such that bc = a(kc). Since c â‰  0, we can divide both sides by c to get b = ak, and thus a | b.

(d) If a | b and c | d, then there exist integers k and m such that b = ak and d = cm. Therefore, bd = a(kc)m, and since a, k, c, and m are all integers, ac | bd.

3. This statement is false. Consider the case where a = 2, b = 4, and c = 2. Then a | (b + c) since 2 | (4 + 2), but neither a | b nor a | c, since 2 does not divide 4 or 2.
