 To establish that the difference of two consecutive cubes is never divisible by 2, we can use the property of cubes and the properties of even and odd numbers.

Let's consider two consecutive integers, say n and n+1. We want to find the difference of their cubes, which is (n+1)^3 - n^3.

Expanding the cubes, we get:

(n+1)^3 - n^3 = (n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1) - n^3

Simplifying, we get:

3n^2 + 3n + 1

Now, let's consider the properties of even and odd numbers. If n is even, then n^2 is even (since the square of an even number is even). If n is odd, then n^2 is odd (since the square of an odd number is odd). In either case, 3n^2 is even (since the product of an even number and any integer is even).

Similarly, 3n is even if n is even and odd if n is odd.

Now, let's consider the term 1. Since 1 is an odd number, the sum of an even number and 1 is always odd.

So, the expression 3n^2 + 3n + 1 is always odd.

Therefore, the difference of two consecutive cubes, (n+1)^3 - n^3, is never divisible by 2, as it is always odd.
