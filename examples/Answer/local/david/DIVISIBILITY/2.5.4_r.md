 To prove that the Diophantine equation ax - by = c has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers, we will use the concept of Bezout's Identity and the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

First, let's recall that a and b are relatively prime positive integers, which means that the greatest common divisor of a and b is 1, i.e., gcd(a, b) = 1.

Now, let's consider the Diophantine equation ax - by = c. We know that there exists integers x and y such that ax - by = gcd(a, b) = 1, by Bezout's Identity. Let's denote these integers as x1 and y1, i.e., ax1 - by1 = 1.

Now, let's multiply both sides of the equation ax1 - by1 = 1 by c, we get acx1 - bcy1 = c. This means that (x, y) = (x1, y1) is a solution to the Diophantine equation ax - by = c.

Next, let's consider an arbitrary integer k. We can add k times the equation ax1 - by1 = 1 to itself, we get:

a(x1 + k) - b(y1 + k) = a(x1) - b(y1) + k(a - b) = 1 + k(a - b).

This means that (x, y) = (x1 + k, y1 + k) is also a solution to the Diophantine equation ax - by = c.

Now, we have shown that for any integer k, (x1 + k, y1 + k) is a solution to the Diophantine equation ax - by = c. Since there are infinitely many integers k, there are infinitely many solutions in the positive integers.

Therefore, we have proved that the Diophantine equation ax - by = c has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers.
