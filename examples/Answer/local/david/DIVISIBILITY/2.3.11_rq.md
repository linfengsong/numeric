<think>
Okay, so I need to verify that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b is the same as the gcd of -a and b, -a and -b, and a and -b. Hmm, let me think. I remember that gcd is about the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without a remainder. But what happens when the numbers are negative? 

First, let me recall the definition of gcd. The gcd of two integers a and b is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b. But wait, does the sign of the numbers matter? For example, if I have gcd(6, 9), it's 3. What about gcd(-6, 9)? Well, the divisors of -6 are the same as the divisors of 6, right? Because if a number divides -6, it also divides 6. Similarly, divisors of 9 are the same as divisors of -9. So maybe the gcd of negative numbers is the same as the gcd of their absolute values?

Let me check that. Suppose we have gcd(-a, b). Since gcd is defined for positive integers, maybe we can take absolute values first. So maybe gcd(-a, b) is equal to gcd(|-a|, |b|) which is gcd(a, |b|). But since gcd(a, b) is the same as gcd(a, |b|), because if b is negative, then the gcd is still the same as with the absolute value. Therefore, gcd(-a, b) = gcd(a, b). Similarly, gcd(-a, -b) would be gcd(|-a|, |-b|) = gcd(a, b). And gcd(a, -b) would be gcd(a, |b|) = gcd(a, b). So that seems to make sense. 

But wait, maybe I need to be more formal here. Let me try to recall the properties of gcd. One important property is that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b + ka) for any integer k. Also, gcd(a, b) = gcd(|a|, |b|). Is that right? I think so. Because if you take absolute values, the divisors are the same. So, for example, gcd(-a, b) = gcd(|-a|, b) = gcd(a, b). Similarly, gcd(a, -b) = gcd(a, |b|) = gcd(a, b). And gcd(-a, -b) = gcd(|-a|, |-b|) = gcd(a, b). Therefore, all these are equal. 

But maybe I need to verify this with some examples. Let me take some numbers. Let's say a = 4 and b = 6. Then gcd(4, 6) is 2. Now, gcd(-4, 6) should also be 2. Divisors of -4 are ±1, ±2, ±4. Divisors of 6 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6. The common divisors are ±1, ±2. The greatest one is 2. Similarly, gcd(4, -6) would be the same. Divisors of 4 are same as before, divisors of -6 are same as 6, so same result. And gcd(-4, -6) would be divisors of -4 and -6, which are same as divisors of 4 and 6. So again, gcd is 2. So that works. 

Another example: a = 0 and b = 5. Wait, but the problem says not both of which are zero. So if a is 0, then gcd(0, 5) is 5. Then gcd(-0, 5) is gcd(0, 5) which is still 5. Similarly, gcd(0, -5) is 5, and gcd(-0, -5) is 5. So that works too. 

But maybe I should think about the case when both a and b are negative. Let's say a = -3, b = -6. Then gcd(-3, -6) is 3, since the divisors of -3 are ±1, ±3 and divisors of -6 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6. Common divisors are ±1, ±3. The greatest positive one is 3. Which is same as gcd(3, 6). So that works. 

Wait, but maybe there's a more formal way to show this? Let me try to recall the definition. The gcd is the greatest common divisor, so it's the largest positive integer that divides both numbers. So if we have negative numbers, their divisors are the same as the absolute values. Therefore, the set of common divisors of -a and b is the same as the set of common divisors of a and b. Therefore, the greatest common divisor is the same. 

Alternatively, maybe using the Euclidean algorithm? Let me think. The Euclidean algorithm relies on the fact that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b). But if we have negative numbers, does that affect the algorithm? For example, if we compute gcd(-a, b), since the remainder when dividing -a by b is the same as when dividing a by b? Wait, let's see. Let me recall that in the Euclidean algorithm, the remainder is always non-negative. So if we have a negative number, say -a, and we divide by b, we can adjust the quotient accordingly. 

For example, suppose we want to compute gcd(-a, b). Let me think of it as gcd(b, -a). But since gcd(b, -a) = gcd(b, a), because gcd(b, -a) is same as gcd(b, a). Therefore, the Euclidean algorithm would proceed the same way. Therefore, the gcd is unaffected by the sign of the numbers. 

Alternatively, maybe using the definition that gcd(a, b) is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as ax + by for integers x and y. Wait, is that correct? Actually, that's the definition of the gcd in terms of linear combinations. So if we have ax + by = d, then for negative numbers, say -a and b, we can write (-a)x + by = d, which is the same as ax + by = -d. But since d is positive, -d is negative. However, since the gcd is the smallest positive integer, maybe we can adjust the signs. 

Wait, actually, the gcd is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as a linear combination. So if we have gcd(-a, b), then the linear combinations would be (-a)x + by. But if we take x' = -x, then it becomes ax' + by. So the same as the linear combinations of a and b. Therefore, the set of linear combinations of -a and b is the same as the set of linear combinations of a and b. Therefore, the gcd is the same. 

Therefore, regardless of the signs, the gcd remains the same. Therefore, gcd(a, b) = gcd(-a, b) = gcd(a, -b) = gcd(-a, -b). 

But maybe I should also consider the case when one of the numbers is zero. Wait, the problem states that not both of which are zero. So if one is zero, say a = 0, then gcd(0, b) is |b|. Similarly, gcd(0, -b) is | -b | = |b|. And gcd(-0, b) is same as gcd(0, b). So that works. 

Alternatively, if both a and b are zero, but the problem says they are not both zero. So we don't have to consider that case. 

Another way to think about it is that the gcd is defined as a positive integer, so even if you have negative numbers, you take their absolute values. Therefore, gcd(a, b) is equal to gcd(|a|, |b|). Therefore, since gcd(-a, b) = gcd(|-a|, |b|) = gcd(a, |b|) = gcd(a, b). Similarly for others. 

Therefore, all those expressions are equal. 

Wait, but let me check another example where the numbers have different signs. Let's say a = 5 and b = -10. Then gcd(5, -10) is 5. Because divisors of 5 are ±1, ±5; divisors of -10 are ±1, ±2, ±5, ±10. Common divisors are ±1, ±5. Greatest positive is 5. Similarly, gcd(-5, -10) is same as gcd(5, 10) which is 5. So that works. 

Alternatively, if a = -7 and b = 14, then gcd(-7, 14) is 7, which is same as gcd(7, 14). 

Therefore, all these examples seem to confirm that the gcd is the same regardless of the signs of a and b. 

But maybe I need to think about the formal proof. Let me try to write it down. 

Let me recall that for any integers a and b, gcd(a, b) = gcd(|a|, |b|). Therefore, if we can show that gcd(-a, b) = gcd(|-a|, |b|) = gcd(a, |b|) = gcd(a, b). Similarly, gcd(a, -b) = gcd(a, |b|) = gcd(a, b). And gcd(-a, -b) = gcd(|-a|, |-b|) = gcd(a, b). Therefore, all four expressions are equal to gcd(a, b). 

Therefore, the equality holds. 

Alternatively, using the property that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, -b). Let me try to prove this. 

Suppose that d divides a and b, then d divides a and -b. Conversely, if d divides a and -b, then d divides a and b. Therefore, the set of common divisors of a and b is same as the set of common divisors of a and -b. Therefore, their gcds are same. Similarly, since gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, -b), and gcd(a, -b) = gcd(-a, -b), and so on. 

Wait, let me elaborate. Let me consider that if d divides a and b, then d divides a and -b. Because if d divides b, then d divides -b. Similarly, if d divides a and -b, then d divides a and b. Therefore, the set of common divisors of a and b is same as the set of common divisors of a and -b. Hence, their gcds are equal. 

Similarly, gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, -b) = gcd(-a, b) = gcd(-a, -b). 

Therefore, this is a more formal proof. 

Alternatively, using the definition of gcd as the largest positive integer that divides both numbers. Since the divisors of a and b are same as the divisors of -a and b, etc., because if a number divides a, it divides -a, and vice versa. Therefore, the largest common divisor is same. 

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the conclusion is the same. 

But maybe I need to check if there's any case where this might not hold? For example, if one of the numbers is zero. Wait, but if a is zero, then gcd(0, b) is |b|. Similarly, gcd(0, -b) is | -b | = |b|. Similarly, gcd(-0, b) is same as gcd(0, b). So that works. 

Another case: if both a and b are zero? But the problem states that they are not both zero. So we don't have to consider that. 

Therefore, I think this covers all cases. 

Therefore, the answer is that the gcd is the same regardless of the signs of the numbers, because the divisors are same as their absolute values, and the gcd is defined as the largest positive integer that divides both numbers. Therefore, gcd(a, b) = gcd(-a, b) = gcd(a, -b) = gcd(-a, -b). 

**Final Answer**
The greatest common divisors are equal, so the result is \boxed{gcd(a, b)}.
</think>

To verify that  
$$
\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(-a, b) = \gcd(a, -b) = \gcd(-a, -b)
$$
for any integers $ a $ and $ b $, not both zero, we must understand how the **greatest common divisor (gcd)** behaves with respect to the sign of the integers involved.

### **Understanding the GCD**

The **greatest common divisor** of two integers $ a $ and $ b $ is defined as the **largest positive integer** that divides both $ a $ and $ b $ without leaving a remainder. That is, it is the **largest positive integer** that is a **common divisor** of both numbers.

Importantly, the **gcd is always non-negative**, and it is **independent of the sign** of the input integers. This is because:

- A divisor of a number is also a divisor of its negative counterpart.
- For example, if $ d $ divides $ a $, then $ d $ also divides $ -a $, and vice versa.

### **Key Property of GCD**

A crucial property of the gcd is:

$$
\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(|a|, |b|)
$$

This is because the set of common divisors of $ a $ and $ b $ is the same as the set of common divisors of $ |a| $ and $ |b| $, and the gcd is the **maximum** of these common divisors.

---

### **Applying the Property**

Let’s apply this to the expressions in the problem:

1. **$ \gcd(-a, b) $**  
   Since $ \gcd(-a, b) = \gcd(|-a|, |b|) = \gcd(a, b) $

2. **$ \gcd(a, -b) $**  
   Similarly, $ \gcd(a, -b) = \gcd(a, |b|) = \gcd(a, b) $

3. **$ \gcd(-a, -b) $**  
   $ \gcd(-a, -b) = \gcd(|-a|, |-b|) = \gcd(a, b) $

Thus, all four expressions reduce to the same value, $ \gcd(a, b) $.

---

### **Special Case: One of the Numbers is Zero**

Suppose $ a = 0 $, then $ \gcd(0, b) = |b| $, and similarly:

- $ \gcd(0, -b) = |b| $
- $ \gcd(-0, b) = |b| $
- $ \gcd(-0, -b) = |b| $

So again, all are equal to $ \gcd(0, b) = |b| $, which is consistent with the general result.

---

### **Conclusion**

Since the gcd of two integers is defined as the **largest positive integer** that divides both, and since the sign of the integers does not affect the set of common divisors, we conclude that:

$$
\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(-a, b) = \gcd(a, -b) = \gcd(-a, -b)
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\gcd(a, b)}
