 To prove that $3a^2$ - 1 is never a perfect square, we can use a proof by contradiction. We will assume that there exists an integer $a$ such that $3a^2$ - 1 is a perfect square, and then show that this leads to a contradiction.

Let's assume that $3a^2$ - 1 is a perfect square, which means there exists an integer $k$ such that $3a^2$ - 1 = $k^2$.

Now, let's rearrange the equation to isolate $a^2$:

$3a^2$ = $k^2$ + 1

$a^2$ = $\frac{k^2 + 1}{3}$

Since $a^2$ is an integer, $\frac{k^2 + 1}{3}$ must also be an integer. However, this is a contradiction because $k^2 + 1$ is always one more than a multiple of 3, and a number that is one more than a multiple of 3 cannot be divided by 3 without a remainder.

Therefore, our assumption that $3a^2$ - 1 is a perfect square is false, and we have proven that $3a^2$ - 1 is never a perfect square.
