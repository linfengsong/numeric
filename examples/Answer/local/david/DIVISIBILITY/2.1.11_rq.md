Okay, so I need to verify these two relations between pentagonal, square, and triangular numbers for n ≥ 2. Let me start by recalling what each of these numbers are. 

First, triangular numbers. The formula for the nth triangular number, t_n, is n(n + 1)/2. That's straightforward. 

Square numbers are a bit simpler, right? The nth square number is just n². 

Pentagonal numbers... Hmm, I think pentagonal numbers are a bit more complex. Let me recall. The formula for the nth pentagonal number, p_n, is given by p_n = n(3n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. I remember that pentagonal numbers can be represented by a formula similar to triangular numbers but with different coefficients. Let me verify. 

Yes, according to my notes, the pentagonal number formula is p_n = n(3n - 1)/2. For example, the first few pentagonal numbers are 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, etc. Let me check for n=1: 1*(3*1 -1)/2 = 1*2/2 = 1. For n=2: 2*(6 -1)/2 = 2*5/2 = 5. Yep, that seems right. 

So, given that, let me tackle part (a): p_n = t_{n-1} + n². 

First, let me write down the formulas:

p_n = n(3n - 1)/2

t_{n-1} = (n - 1)(n)/2

n² is just n². 

So according to the equation, p_n should equal t_{n-1} + n². Let me compute both sides and see if they match. 

Left side: p_n = n(3n - 1)/2

Right side: t_{n-1} + n² = [(n - 1)n]/2 + n². Let me compute that:

[(n² - n)/2] + n² = (n² - n)/2 + (2n²)/2 = (n² - n + 2n²)/2 = (3n² - n)/2. 

Which is exactly the same as the left side, n(3n - 1)/2. So yes, they are equal. Therefore, part (a) is verified. 

Wait, that was straightforward. Let me check with a specific example to make sure. Let's take n=2. 

For n=2:

Left side: p_2 = 2*(6 - 1)/2 = 2*5/2 = 5.

Right side: t_{1} + 2² = 1 + 4 = 5. Yep, matches. 

Another example, n=3:

Left side: p_3 = 3*(9 -1)/2 = 3*8/2 = 12.

Right side: t_2 + 9 = 3 + 9 = 12. Perfect. 

Okay, so part (a) seems to check out. 

Now moving on to part (b): p_n = 3t_{n-1} + n = 2t_{n-1} + t_n. 

Wait, so this is saying that p_n is equal to both 3t_{n-1} + n and also 2t_{n-1} + t_n. So I need to verify both equations. 

First, let me check the first one: p_n = 3t_{n-1} + n. 

Again, using the formulas:

Left side: p_n = n(3n -1)/2

Right side: 3t_{n-1} + n = 3*[(n -1)n/2] + n = [3n(n -1)/2] + n. Let me compute that:

First term: 3n(n -1)/2 = [3n² - 3n]/2

Adding n: [3n² - 3n]/2 + n = [3n² - 3n + 2n]/2 = [3n² - n]/2 = n(3n -1)/2, which is equal to p_n. 

So that checks out. 

Now, let me check the second equation: p_n = 2t_{n-1} + t_n. 

Again, let me compute both sides. 

Left side: p_n = n(3n -1)/2

Right side: 2t_{n-1} + t_n = 2*[(n -1)n/2] + [n(n +1)/2]

Simplify:

First term: 2*(n² -n)/2 = n² -n

Second term: [n(n +1)]/2 = (n² +n)/2

Adding them together: n² -n + (n² +n)/2. Let me combine these terms. 

Convert n² -n to have denominator 2: [2n² - 2n]/2 + [n² +n]/2 = [2n² - 2n + n² +n]/2 = [3n² -n]/2 = n(3n -1)/2, which is equal to p_n. 

So that also checks out. 

Therefore, both equations in part (b) are verified. 

But just to be thorough, let me test with specific numbers again. 

Take n=2:

First equation: 3t_{1} + 2 = 3*1 + 2 = 5, which is p_2 =5. Correct.

Second equation: 2t_{1} + t_2 = 2*1 + 3 = 5. Correct.

n=3:

First equation: 3t_2 + 3 = 3*3 + 3 = 9 + 3 = 12, which is p_3=12. Correct.

Second equation: 2t_2 + t_3 = 2*3 + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12. Correct.

Another one, n=4:

p_4 = 4*(12 -1)/2 = 4*11/2 = 22.

First equation: 3t_3 +4 = 3*6 +4 = 18 +4=22. Correct.

Second equation: 2t_3 + t_4 = 2*6 + 10 = 12 +10=22. Correct.

Perfect. So both equations hold. 

Therefore, both parts (a) and (b) are verified. 

But let me just think again if there's a possibility I made a mistake in the formulas. For example, sometimes pentagonal numbers have different formulas depending on the type, but I think the formula p_n = n(3n -1)/2 is correct. Let me check for n=1, which is 1*(3*1 -1)/2 = 1*2/2 =1, which is correct. For n=0, it would be 0, but n starts from 2 here. 

Also, triangular numbers: t_n = n(n+1)/2. So t_{n-1} is (n-1)n/2. Correct. 

So, all the formulas are correct. Therefore, the relations hold. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a way to derive these relations without just plugging in formulas? Let me think. 

For part (a): p_n = t_{n-1} + n². 

Geometrically, pentagonal numbers can be thought of as... Well, pentagonal numbers are related to the number of dots in a pentagon. Maybe there's a way to decompose the pentagon into a triangular number and a square? 

But maybe that's overcomplicating. Since the algebra checks out, and the examples work, maybe that's sufficient. 

Alternatively, for part (b), maybe there's a way to express pentagonal numbers in terms of triangular numbers. Since triangular numbers are sums of integers, and pentagonal numbers have their own formula. 

But again, since the algebraic verification works, and the examples check out, I think that's solid. 

Therefore, I can conclude that both (a) and (b) are correct. 

**Final Answer**

(a) $\boxed{p_n = t_{n-1} + n^2}$ is verified.

(b) $\boxed{p_n = 3t_{n-1} + n}$ and $\boxed{p_n = 2t_{n-1} + t_n}$ are verified.

To verify the given relations between pentagonal, square, and triangular numbers for $ n \geq 2 $, we start by recalling the standard formulas for these number sequences:

- **Triangular numbers**:  
  $$
  t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
  $$
- **Square numbers**:  
  $$
  n^2
  $$
- **Pentagonal numbers**:

### **(a) Verification of $ p_n = t_{n-1} + n^2 $**

We start by substituting the known formulas into both sides of the equation:

**Left-hand side (LHS):**  
$$
p_n = \frac{n(3n - 1)}{2}
$$

**Right-hand side (RHS):**

$$
