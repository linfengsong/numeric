 To prove this, we will use the Well-Ordering Principle, which states that every non-empty set of positive integers contains a least element.

Let S = {a - kb | k ∈ Z, a - kb ≥ 0}. Since b ≠ 0, S is non-empty. By the Well-Ordering Principle, S has a least element, say r = a - qb, where q ∈ Z.

Now, we need to show that 2b ≤ r < 3b. Since r is the least element of S, we have a - (q + 1)b > 0, which implies a > (q + 1)b. Therefore, a - qb < b, so r = a - qb < b.

Next, we show that r ≥ 2b. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that r < 2b. Then, a - qb < 2b, which implies a < (q + 2)b. But this contradicts the fact that r = a - qb is the least element of S, since (q + 2)b - qb = 2b > b and (q + 2)b - qb = 2b ∈ S.

Thus, we have shown that 2b ≤ r < 3b. To show uniqueness, suppose there are two pairs (q, r) and (q', r') satisfying the conditions. Then, we have:

a = qb + r = q'b + r'

Subtracting the two equations, we get:

(q - q')b = r' - r

Since 2b ≤ r' - r < 3b, we have:

-3b < (q - q')b ≤ -2b

Since b ≠ 0, we can divide by b:

-3 < q - q' ≤ -2

But q and q' are integers, so the only possibility is q - q' = -1. Then, r' - r = b, which implies r' = r + b. But we have already established that r < 3b, so r + b < 4b. Therefore, r' < 4b, which contradicts the fact that 2b ≤ r' < 3b.

Thus, the integers q and r are unique.
