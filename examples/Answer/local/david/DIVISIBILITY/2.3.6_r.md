 (a) To verify that $2 | a(a + 1)$, we need to show that $a(a + 1)$ is divisible by 2 for any integer a.

If a is even, then $a = 2k$ for some integer k. Substituting this into the expression, we get $2k(2k + 1)$, which is clearly divisible by 2.

If a is odd, then $a = 2k + 1$ for some integer k. Substituting this into the expression, we get $(2k + 1)(2k + 2)$, which simplifies to $2(2k + 1)(k + 1)$, which is also clearly divisible by 2.

Therefore, $2 | a(a + 1)$ for any integer a.

To verify that $3 | a(a + 1)(a + 2)$, we need to show that $a(a + 1)(a + 2)$ is divisible by 3 for any integer a.

If a is a multiple of 3, then $a = 3k$ for some integer k. Substituting this into the expression, we get $3k(3k + 1)(3k + 2)$, which is clearly divisible by 3.

If a is one less than a multiple of 3, then $a = 3k - 1$ for some integer k. Substituting this into the expression, we get $(3k - 1)(3k)(3k + 1)$, which simplifies to $3(3k - 1)(k)(3k + 1)$, which is also clearly divisible by 3.

If a is one more than a multiple of 3, then $a = 3k + 1$ for some integer k. Substituting this into the expression, we get $(3k + 1)(3k + 2)(3k + 3)$, which simplifies to $3(3k + 1)(k + 1)(3k + 2)$, which is also clearly divisible by 3.

Therefore, $3 | a(a + 1)(a + 2)$ for any integer a.

(b) To verify that $3 | a(2a^2 + 7)$, we need to show that $a(2a^2 + 7)$ is divisible by 3 for any integer a.

If a is a multiple of 3, then $a = 3k$ for some integer k. Substituting this into the expression, we get $3k(2(3k)^2 + 7)$, which simplifies to $3k(18k^2 + 7)$, which is clearly divisible by 3.

If a is one less than a multiple of 3, then $a = 3k - 1$ for some integer k. Substituting this into the expression, we get $(3k - 1)(2(3k - 1)^2 + 7)$, which simplifies to $(3k - 1)(18k^2 - 12k + 9)$, which is also clearly divisible by 3.

If a is one more than a multiple of 3, then $a = 3k + 1$ for some integer k. Substituting this into the expression, we get $(3k + 1)(2(3k + 1)^2 + 7)$, which simplifies to $(3k + 1)(18k^2 + 12k + 9)$, which is also clearly divisible by 3.

Therefore, $3 | a(2a^2 + 7)$ for any integer a.

(c) If a is odd, then $a = 2k + 1$ for some integer k. Substituting this into the expression, we get $(2k + 1)^2 + 3$ and $(2k + 1)^2 + 7$, which simplifies to $4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 3$ and $4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 7$, respectively.

Now, we have $(4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 3)(4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 7)$, which simplifies to $(4k^2 + 4k + 4)(4k^2 + 4k + 8)$.

Factoring out a 4 from each term, we get $4(k^2 + k + 1)(4k^2 + 4k + 2)$, which simplifies to $16(k^2 + k + 1)(k^2 + k + 2)$.

Now, we have $16(k^2 + k + 1)(k^2 + k + 2)$, which is clearly divisible by 32.

Therefore, if a is odd, then $32 | (a^2 + 3)(a^2 + 7)$.
