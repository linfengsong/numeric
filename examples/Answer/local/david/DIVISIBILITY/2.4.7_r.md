 To verify that these conditions are equivalent, we need to show that if one condition is true, then all the other conditions are also true.

(a) ⇒ (b): If a | b, then there exists an integer k such that b = ak. The greatest common divisor of a and b is the largest integer that divides both a and b. Since a divides b, |a| is a common divisor of a and b. Now, we need to show that |a| is the greatest common divisor.

Let d be any common divisor of a and b. Then d divides both a and b, so d must also divide ak. Since d divides ak, d must divide |a|. Therefore, d ≤ |a|. This shows that |a| is the greatest common divisor of a and b, so gcd(a, b) = |a|.

(b) ⇒ (a): If gcd(a, b) = |a|, then |a| is a common divisor of a and b. Since |a| divides a, a | b.

(b) ⇒ (c): If gcd(a, b) = |a|, then the least common multiple of a and b is given by the formula lcm(a, b) = |ab| / gcd(a, b). Substituting the given values, we get lcm(a, b) = |ab| / |a| = |b|.

(c) ⇒ (b): If lcm(a, b) = |b|, then the greatest common divisor of a and b is given by the formula gcd(a, b) = |ab| / lcm(a, b). Substituting the given values, we get gcd(a, b) = |ab| / |b| = |a|.

Since we have shown that (a) ⇔ (b) and (b) ⇔ (c), we can conclude that the conditions (a), (b), and (c) are equivalent.
