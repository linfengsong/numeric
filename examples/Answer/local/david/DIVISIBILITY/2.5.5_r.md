 (a) Let $d$ be the number of dimes and $q$ be the number of quarters.
The total value of the dimes is $10d$ cents and the total value of the quarters is $25q$ cents.
Since the total value is $455$ cents, we have the equation $10d + 25q = 455$.
To maximize the number of coins, we want to minimize the value of $d$ and $q$.
We can start by setting $d = 0$ and solving for $q$:
$10(0) + 25q = 455 \Rightarrow q = 19$.
So, the maximum number of coins is $d + q = 0 + 19 = 19$.
To minimize the number of coins, we want to maximize the value of $d$ and $q$.
We can start by setting $q = 0$ and solving for $d$:
$10d + 25(0) = 455 \Rightarrow d = 45.5$.
Since $d$ must be an integer, the minimum number of coins is $d + q = 46 + 0 = 46$.
It is not possible for the number of dimes to equal the number of quarters because the total value of the dimes is $10d$ cents and the total value of the quarters is $25q$ cents.
Since $10d$ is a multiple of $10$ and $25q$ is a multiple of $25$, the total value of the dimes and quarters must be a multiple of $5$.
But $455$ is not a multiple of $5$, so it is not possible for the number of dimes to equal the number of quarters.

(b) Let $a$ be the number of adults and $c$ be the number of children.
The total revenue from adult admissions is $1.80a$ dollars and the total revenue from children's admissions is $.75c$ dollars.
Since the total receipts were $90, we have the equation $1.80a + .75c = 90$.
To minimize the number of people, we want to maximize the value of $a$ and $c$.
We can start by setting $c = 0$ and solving for $a$:
$1.80a + .75(0) = 90 \Rightarrow a = 50$.
So, the maximum number of people is $a + c = 50 + 0 = 50$.

(c) Let $x$ be the number of sixes and $y$ be the number of nines.
The sum of the number of sixes and nines is $x + y$.
The sum of the values of the sixes and nines is $6x + 9y$.
We are given that $6x + 9y = 126$ and $9x + 6y = 114$.
We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $3$ and the second equation by $2$:
$18x + 27y = 378$
$18x + 12y = 228$
Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:
$15y = 150 \Rightarrow y = 10$.
Substituting this value of $y$ into the first equation, we get:
$6x + 9(10) = 126 \Rightarrow 6x + 90 = 126 \Rightarrow 6x = 36 \Rightarrow x = 6$.
So, there were originally $x + y = 6 + 10 = 16$ sixes and nines.
The answer is $\boxed{(a) 19,46; (b) 50; (c) 16}$.
