 (a) To show that $gcd(a^n, b^n) = 1$, we will use the property of gcd that if gcd(a, b) = 1, then there exist integers x and y such that $ax + by = 1$. We will raise both sides of this equation to the power of n, which gives us $(ax)^n + (by)^n = 1^n = 1$. This equation shows that $a^n x^n + b^n y^n = 1$, which means that gcd($a^n, b^n$) = 1.

(b) To show that $a^n | b^n$ implies that a | b, we will use the property of divisibility that if a | b, then there exists an integer k such that b = ak. We will raise both sides of this equation to the power of n, which gives us $b^n = (ak)^n = a^n k^n$. This equation shows that $a^n k^n = b^n$, which means that $a^n | b^n$. Since we have shown that $a^n | b^n$ implies that a | b, the relation $a^n | b^n$ implies that a | b.
