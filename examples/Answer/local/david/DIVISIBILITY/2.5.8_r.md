 (a) Let $m$, $w$, and $c$ be the number of men, women, and children, respectively. We have the following system of equations:
\begin{align*}
m + w + c &= 100 \\
3m + 2w + \frac{1}{2}c &= 100
\end{align*}
Multiplying the second equation by 2, we get:
\begin{align*}
6m + 4w + c &= 200
\end{align*}
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\begin{align*}
5m + 3w &= 100
\end{align*}
We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 5:
\begin{align*}
3m + 3w + 3c &= 300 \\
25m + 15w + 5c &= 500
\end{align*}
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\begin{align*}
22m + 12w + 2c &= 200
\end{align*}
Divide this equation by 2:
\begin{align*}
11m + 6w + c &= 100
\end{align*}
Now we have two equations:
\begin{align*}
5m + 3w &= 100 \\
11m + 6w + c &= 100
\end{align*}
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\begin{align*}
6m + 3w + c &= 0
\end{align*}
Divide this equation by 3:
\begin{align*}
2m + w + \frac{1}{3}c &= 0
\end{align*}
Since $m$, $w$, and $c$ are all integers, the only way for this equation to be true is if $c = 0$. Substituting this back into the first equation, we get:
\begin{align*}
m + w &= 100
\end{align*}
Since $m$ and $w$ are both integers, the only way for this equation to be true is if $m = 50$ and $w = 50$. Therefore, there are 50 men, 50 women, and 0 children.

(b) Let $p$ be the number of fruits in each pile. We have the following equation:
\begin{align*}
63p + 7 &= 23p
\end{align*}
Subtracting $23p$ from both sides, we get:
\begin{align*}
40p + 7 &= 0
\end{align*}
Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get:
\begin{align*}
40p &= -7
\end{align*}
Dividing both sides by 40, we get:
\begin{align*}
p &= -\frac{7}{40}
\end{align*}
Since the number of fruits cannot be negative, there is no solution to this problem.

(c) Let $x$ be the number of coins. We have the following system of equations:
\begin{align*}
77x + 50 &= 78x
\end{align*}
Subtracting $77x$ from both sides, we get:
\begin{align*}
x &= 50
\end{align*}
Therefore, there are 50 coins.

(d) Let $m$, $w$, and $c$ be the number of men, women, and children, respectively. We have the following system of equations:
\begin{align*}
m + w + c &= 20 \\
3m + 2w + \frac{1}{2}c &= 20
\end{align*}
Multiplying the second equation by 2, we get:
\begin{align*}
6m + 4w + c &= 40
\end{align*}
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\begin{align*}
5m + 3w &= 20
\end{align*}
We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 5:
\begin{align*}
3m + 3w + 3c &= 60 \\
25m + 15w + 5c &= 100
\end{align*}
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\begin{align*}
22m + 12w + 2c &= 40
\end{align*}
Divide this equation by 2:
\begin{align*}
11m + 6w + c &= 20
\end{align*}
Now we have two equations:
\begin{align*}
5m + 3w &= 20 \\
11m + 6w + c &= 20
\end{align*}
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\begin{align*}
6m + 3w + c &= 0
\end{align*}
Divide this equation by 3:
\begin{align*}
2m + w + \frac{1}{3}c &= 0
\end{align*}
Since $m$, $w$, and $c$ are all integers, the only way for this equation to be true is if $c = 0$. Substituting this back into the first equation, we get:
\begin{align*}
5m + 3w &= 20
\end{align*}
We can solve this equation by trial and error. The possible solutions are $(m, w) = (4, 0)$, $(1, 5)$, and $(2, 2)$. Since we are looking for the number of men, women, and children, we can eliminate the solutions where there are no children. Therefore, the only possible solution is $(m, w) = (4, 0)$. Therefore, there are 4 men, 0 women, and 16 children.

(e) Let $x$ be the number of coins. We have the following system of equations:
\begin{align*}
x &\equiv 0 \pmod{7} \\
x &\equiv 0 \pmod{11}
\end{align*}
The least common multiple of 7 and 11 is 77. Therefore, the number of coins must be a multiple of 77. Since we want to divide the coins into two summands, one of which is divisible by 7 and the other by 11, the number of coins must be 77. Therefore, the two summands are 0 and 77.
