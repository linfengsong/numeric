 The $n$th triangular number is given by $t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

We want to find the values of $n$ such that $t_n$ divides the sum $t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_n$.

The sum $t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_n$ is equal to $\frac{1(1+1)}{2} + \frac{2(2+1)}{2} + \ldots + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

This simplifies to $1 + 3 + 6 + \ldots + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

We can rewrite this as $\frac{1}{2}(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n + n + n + \ldots + n)$, where there are $n$ terms of $n$.

This is equal to $\frac{1}{2}(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n^2)$.

We want to find the values of $n$ such that $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ divides $\frac{1}{2}(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n^2)$.

This simplifies to $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ divides $n^2 + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

This is equivalent to $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ divides $2n^2 + n$.

Since $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is a factor of $2n^2 + n$, we can conclude that $n$ must be a divisor of $2n^2 + n$.

Therefore, the values of $n$ for which $t_n$ divides the sum $t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_n$ are the divisors of $2n^2 + n$.

The answer is $\boxed{the divisors of $2n^2 + n$.}$.
The answer is $\boxed{the divisors of $2n^2 + n$.}$.
The answer is $\boxed{the divisors of $2n^2 + n$.}$.
