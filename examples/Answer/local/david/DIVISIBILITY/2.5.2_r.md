 (a) 56x + 72y = 40.

First, we simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor of 56 and 72, which is 8. This gives us:

7x + 9y = 5.

Now, we need to find the general solution for this equation. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which states that there exist integers x and y such that:

7x + 9y = gcd(7, 9) = 1.

Applying the extended Euclidean algorithm to 7 and 9, we get:

9 = 1 * 7 + 2,
7 = 3 * 2 + 1.

Rearranging the first equation, we get:

2 = 9 - 1 * 7.

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

7 = 3 * (9 - 1 * 7) + 1,
7 = 3 * 9 - 4 * 7 + 1,
5 * 7 = 3 * 9 + 1.

So, we have found that 5 * 7 - 3 * 9 = 1. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

5 * (5 * 7) - 3 * 9 * 5 = 5,
5 * 7 * 5 - 3 * 9 * 5 = 5,
7 * 25 - 9 * 15 = 5.

So, one particular solution is x = 25 and y = 15. The general solution is given by:

x = 25 + 9t,
y = 15 - 7t,

where t is an integer.

Now, we need to find the solutions that satisfy the original equation 56x + 72y = 40. Substituting the general solution into the equation, we get:

56(25 + 9t) + 72(15 - 7t) = 40,
1400 + 504t + 1080 - 504t = 40,
2480 = 40.

This equation is not satisfied by any integer t, so there are no solutions in the integers for the equation 56x + 72y = 40.

(b) 24x + 138y = 18.

First, we simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor of 24 and 138, which is 6. This gives us:

4x + 23y = 3.

Now, we need to find the general solution for this equation. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which states that there exist integers x and y such that:

4x + 23y = gcd(4, 23) = 1.

Applying the extended Euclidean algorithm to 4 and 23, we get:

23 = 5 * 4 + 3,
4 = 1 * 3 + 1.

Rearranging the first equation, we get:

3 = 23 - 5 * 4.

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

4 = 1 * (23 - 5 * 4) + 1,
4 = 23 - 5 * 4 + 1,
6 * 4 = 23 + 1,
6 * 4 = 24.

So, we have found that 6 * 4 - 1 * 23 = 1. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

3 * (6 * 4) - 3 * 23 = 3,
18 * 4 - 69 = 3,
72 - 69 = 3.

So, one particular solution is x = 18 and y = -69/23 = -3. The general solution is given by:

x = 18 + 23t,
y = -3 - 4t,

where t is an integer.

Now, we need to find the solutions that satisfy the original equation 24x + 138y = 18. Substituting the general solution into the equation, we get:

24(18 + 23t) + 138(-3 - 4t) = 18,
432 + 552t - 414 - 552t = 18,
90 = 18.

This equation is not satisfied by any integer t, so there are no solutions in the integers for the equation 24x + 138y = 18.

(c) 221x + 35y = 11.

First, we simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor of 221 and 35, which is 1. This gives us:

221x + 35y = 11.

Now, we need to find the general solution for this equation. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which states that there exist integers x and y such that:

221x + 35y = gcd(221, 35) = 1.

Applying the extended Euclidean algorithm to 221 and 35, we get:

221 = 6 * 35 + 1,
35 = 35 * 1 + 0.

So, we have found that 1 * 221 + (-6) * 35 = 1. Multiplying both sides by 11, we get:

11 * 221 - 66 * 35 = 11,
2431 - 2310 = 11.

So, one particular solution is x = 2431 and y = -2310. The general solution is given by:

x = 2431 + 35t,
y = -2310 - 221t,

where t is an integer.

Now, we need to find the solutions that satisfy the original equation 221x + 35y = 11. Substituting the general solution into the equation, we get:

221(2431 + 35t) + 35(-2310 - 221t) = 11,
539451 + 77285t - 813570 - 77285t = 11,
-273119 = 11.

This equation is not satisfied by any integer t, so there are no solutions in the integers for the equation 221x + 35y = 11.
