Okay, so I need to prove that for any positive integer n and any integer a, the greatest common divisor of a and a + n divides n. And then specifically show that gcd(a, a + 1) = 1. Let me start by recalling some basic properties of gcd.

First, I remember that the gcd of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. Also, there's the Euclidean algorithm which helps in finding the gcd of two numbers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm. Maybe I can use that here?

Let me think about the general case first: gcd(a, a + n). Let me denote d = gcd(a, a + n). By definition, d divides both a and a + n. So, if d divides a and d divides a + n, then d must divide their difference. Let me check that.

If d divides a and d divides a + n, then d divides (a + n) - a, which is n. Therefore, d divides n. So that shows that any common divisor of a and a + n must divide n. Therefore, the gcd(a, a + n) must divide n. That seems straightforward. Wait, is that all? Let me verify with an example.

Take a = 4 and n = 6. Then a + n = 10. gcd(4, 10) is 2. And 2 divides 6, which is n. Another example: a = 5, n = 3. Then a + n = 8. gcd(5, 8) is 1, which divides 3. Yeah, that works. So maybe that's the proof? Let me write it more formally.

Let d = gcd(a, a + n). Then d divides a and d divides a + n. Therefore, d divides (a + n) - a = n. Therefore, d divides n. Therefore, gcd(a, a + n) divides n. So that's the general case. Therefore, the first part is proven.

Now, the second part is to show that gcd(a, a + 1) = 1. Well, using the same logic. Let me apply the first result here. Let n = 1. Then gcd(a, a + 1) divides 1. But the only positive integer that divides 1 is 1 itself. Therefore, gcd(a, a + 1) must be 1. So that's the conclusion.

Wait, but maybe I should also think about it directly. Suppose there is a common divisor d of a and a + 1. Then d divides a and d divides a + 1. Therefore, d divides (a + 1) - a = 1. Therefore, d divides 1. Hence, the only possible positive divisor is 1. Therefore, gcd(a, a + 1) = 1. That's another way to see it.

So both proofs are similar. The first one is a general case, and the second is a specific case when n = 1. Therefore, the conclusion is correct.

But let me check if there are any edge cases. For example, if a is negative? Wait, the problem says "any integer a", so a can be negative. But gcd is always defined as a positive integer, right? So even if a is negative, gcd(a, a + n) is the same as gcd(|a|, |a + n|). So the result still holds because the difference would still be n, and the divisors are considered in positive integers. So even if a is negative, the same logic applies.

Another example: Let a = -3, n = 5. Then a + n = 2. gcd(-3, 2) is 1, which divides 5. Correct. Another example: a = -4, n = 6. Then a + n = 2. gcd(-4, 2) is 2, which divides 6. Yep.

Therefore, the proof seems solid. So the key idea is that the gcd divides the difference between the two numbers, which in this case is n. Therefore, the gcd divides n. And when n is 1, the only possible divisor is 1 itself.

I think that's all. Maybe I can also recall that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - ka) for any integer k. So applying that here, gcd(a, a + n) = gcd(a, (a + n) - a) = gcd(a, n). Therefore, gcd(a, a + n) = gcd(a, n). Therefore, since gcd(a, n) divides n, then the original gcd divides n. So that's another way to think about it. So that gives another proof.

Wait, so if I use the property that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - ka), then for gcd(a, a + n), subtract a from the second term, so we get gcd(a, n). Therefore, gcd(a, a + n) = gcd(a, n). Therefore, since gcd(a, n) divides n, then the original gcd divides n. Therefore, that's another way to see it.

But in this case, the problem is to show that gcd(a, a + n) divides n, which is equivalent to saying that gcd(a, n) divides n, which is obviously true. Wait, but maybe the problem is expecting the first proof where you take the difference, but both are valid. Either way, the conclusion is the same.

So, in summary, the first part is proven by showing that any common divisor of a and a + n must divide their difference, which is n, hence the gcd divides n. The second part is a specific case where n = 1, so the gcd divides 1, hence must be 1.

Therefore, I think that's the answer. Let me check again for the second part. If I take a = 1, a + 1 = 2, gcd(1, 2) = 1. If a = 2, gcd(2, 3) = 1. If a = 0, gcd(0, 1) = 1. Wait, gcd(0, 1) is 1? Because gcd(0, n) is |n|. Wait, gcd(0, 1) is 1. Yes, because 1 divides 0 and 1 divides 1, and it's the greatest such. So even if a is 0, it still holds. So even for a = 0, gcd(0, 1) is 1. Therefore, the result holds for all integers a, including zero.

Therefore, the proof is complete. I think that's all.

**Final Answer**
The greatest common divisor of $a$ and $a + 1$ is \boxed{1}.

To prove that for any positive integer $ n $ and any integer $ a $, the greatest common divisor $ \gcd(a, a + n) $ divides $ n $, we begin by analyzing the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd).

### **Step 1: General Proof that $ \gcd(a, a + n) $ Divides $ n $**

Let $ d = \gcd(a, a + n) $. By the definition of the greatest common divisor, $ d $ divides both $ a $ and $ a + n $. That is:

$$
d \mid a \quad \text{and} \quad d \mid (a + n)
$$

Now consider the difference between the two numbers:

$$
(a + n) - a = n
$$

Since $ d $ divides both $ a $ and $ a + n $, it must also divide their difference $ n $. Therefore:

$$
d \mid n
$$

Thus, any common divisor of $ a $ and $ a + n $ must divide $ n $, and in particular, their greatest common divisor $ \gcd(a, a + n) $ must divide $ n $.

$$
\Rightarrow \gcd(a, a + n) \mid n
$$

This completes the first part of the proof.

### **Step 2: Special Case $ n = 1 $, i.e., $ \gcd(a, a + 1) = 1 $**

Now consider the case where $ n = 1 $. Then we have:

$$
\gcd(a, a + 1)
$$

Using the same logic as before, let $ d = \gcd(a, a + 1) $. Since $ d \mid a $ and $ d \mid (a + 1) $, it must divide their difference:

$$
(a + 1) - a = 1
$$

So:

$$
d \mid 1
$$

The only positive integer that divides 1 is 1 itself. Therefore:

$$
\gcd(a, a + 1) = 1
$$

This proves the second part of the statement.

---

### **Conclusion**

We have shown that for any positive integer $ n $ and any integer $ a $, the greatest common divisor $ \gcd(a, a + n) $ divides $ n $. As a specific case, when $ n = 1 $, we find that:

$$
\gcd(a, a + 1) = 1
$$
