 To find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.

Let's start with the first pair of numbers, 143 and 227.

1. Subtract the smaller number 143 from the larger number 227: 227 - 143 = 84.
2. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 143 and 84. Subtract 84 from 143: 143 - 84 = 59.
3. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 84 and 59. Subtract 59 from 84: 84 - 59 = 25.
4. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 59 and 25. Subtract 25 from 59 three times: 59 - 25 - 25 - 25 = 4.
5. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 25 and 4. Subtract 4 from 25 six times: 25 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 = 1.
6. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 4 and 1. Since 4 is not a multiple of 1, we subtract 1 from 4 four times: 4 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = 0.
7. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 1 and 0. Since 0 is a multiple of any number, the gcd is 1.

So, the gcd(143, 227) = 1.

Now, let's find the gcd(306, 657).

1. Subtract the smaller number 306 from the larger number 657: 657 - 306 = 351.
2. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 306 and 351. Subtract 306 from 351: 351 - 306 = 45.
3. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 306 and 45. Subtract 45 from 306 six times: 306 - 45 - 45 - 45 - 45 - 45 - 45 = 186.
4. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 186 and 45. Subtract 45 from 186 four times: 186 - 45 - 45 - 45 - 45 = 21.
5. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 186 and 21. Subtract 21 from 186 eight times: 186 - 21 - 21 - 21 - 21 - 21 - 21 - 21 - 21 = 3.
6. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 21 and 3. Subtract 3 from 21 seven times: 21 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 = 0.
7. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 3 and 0. Since 0 is a multiple of any number, the gcd is 3.

So, the gcd(306, 657) = 3.

Finally, let's find the gcd(272, 1479).

1. Subtract the smaller number 272 from the larger number 1479: 1479 - 272 = 1207.
2. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 272 and 1207. Subtract 272 from 1207 four times: 1207 - 272 - 272 - 272 - 272 = 107.
3. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 272 and 107. Subtract 107 from 272 two times: 272 - 107 - 107 = 60.
4. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 107 and 60. Subtract 60 from 107 one time: 107 - 60 = 47.
5. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 60 and 47. Subtract 47 from 60 one time: 60 - 47 = 13.
6. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 47 and 13. Subtract 13 from 47 three times: 47 - 13 - 13 - 13 = 7.
7. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 13 and 7. Subtract 7 from 13 one time: 13 - 7 = 6.
8. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 7 and 6. Subtract 6 from 7 one time: 7 - 6 = 1.
9. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 6 and 1. Since 6 is not a multiple of 1, we subtract 1 from 6 six times: 6 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = 0.
10. Now, we need to find the gcd of the new pair, 1 and 0. Since 0 is a multiple of any number, the gcd is 1.

So, the gcd(272, 1479) = 1.

In conclusion, the greatest common divisors are gcd(143, 227) = 1, gcd(306, 657) = 3, and gcd(272, 1479) = 1.
