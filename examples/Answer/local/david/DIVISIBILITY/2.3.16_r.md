**Proof:**

We need to show that the expression is divisible by 12. We will consider the expression modulo 3 and modulo 4, and then combine the results.


1. **Modulo 3 Analysis:**

We need to show that the expression is divisible by 3.

\[ a^2 + (a + 2)^2 + (a + 4)^2 + 1 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ a^2 + (a^2 + 4a + 4) + (a^2 + 8a + 16) + 1 \]
\[ = 2a^2 + 12a + 21 \]

Now, modulo 3:
\[ 2a^2 + 12a + 21 \equiv 2a^2 + 0a + 0 \equiv 2a^2 \pmod{3} \]

Since \( a \) is odd, \( a \equiv 1 \text{ or } 2 \pmod{3} \):
- If \( a \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \): \( 2(1)^2 = 2 \)
- If \( a \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \): \( 2(4) = 8 \equiv 2 \)
Thus, the expression is divisible by 3.


2. **Modulo 4 Analysis:**

We need to show that the expression is divisible by 4.

\[ a^2 + (a + 2)^2 + (a + 4)^2 + 1 \]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[ a^2 + (a^2 + 4a + 4) + (a^2 + 8a + 16) + 1 \]
\[ = 2a^2 + 12a + 21 \]
Now, modulo 4:
\[ 2a^2 + 12a + 21 \equiv 2a^2 + 0a + 1 \pmod{4} \]
Since \( a \) is odd, \( a \equiv 1 \text{ or } 3 \pmod{4} \):
- If \( a \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \): \( 2(1)^2 + 1 = 3 \)
- If \( a \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \): \( 2(9) + 1 = 19 \equiv 3 \)
Thus, the expression is divisible by 4.


Since the expression is divisible by both 3 and 4, and 3 and 4 are coprime, the expression is divisible by \( \text{lcm}(3, 4) = 12 \).


Thus, the original expression is divisible by 12.
