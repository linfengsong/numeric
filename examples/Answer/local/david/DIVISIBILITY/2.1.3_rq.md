Okay, so I need to derive the formula for the sum of triangular numbers, which is given as t₁ + t₂ + t₃ + ... + tₙ = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6. Hmm, triangular numbers... right, each triangular number t_k is the sum of the first k natural numbers. So, t_k = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k. And the formula for that is t_k = k(k + 1)/2. So, the problem is asking for the sum of these triangular numbers from k=1 to n. 

Let me write that down. The sum S = Σ (from k=1 to n) [k(k + 1)/2]. So, S = (1/2) Σ [k² + k] from k=1 to n. Which can be split into two separate sums: (1/2)[Σk² + Σk]. 

I remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers is Σk = n(n + 1)/2. And the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers is Σk² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. So, substituting these into the expression for S:

S = (1/2)[n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 + n(n + 1)/2]. Let me compute this step by step. 

First, let me factor out n(n + 1)/2 from both terms inside the brackets. Wait, let me check:

The first term is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6, and the second term is n(n + 1)/2. To combine them, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 6 and 2, so common denominator is 6. So, converting the second term to sixths: n(n + 1)/2 = 3n(n + 1)/6. Therefore, the entire expression inside the brackets becomes [n(n + 1)(2n + 1) + 3n(n + 1)] / 6. 

Factor out n(n + 1) from numerator: n(n + 1)[(2n + 1) + 3]/6. Simplify inside the brackets: (2n + 1 + 3) = 2n + 4 = 2(n + 2). Therefore, numerator becomes n(n + 1)*2(n + 2). So, the entire expression inside the brackets is [2n(n + 1)(n + 2)] / 6. 

Then, remember that the original S was (1/2) times this. So, S = (1/2) * [2n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6] = [2n(n + 1)(n + 2)/12] = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6. 

So that gives the formula. Let me check if this makes sense with small n. Let's take n=1: sum is t₁ = 1. Formula: 1*2*3/6 = 6/6 = 1. Correct. For n=2: t₁ + t₂ = 1 + 3 = 4. Formula: 2*3*4/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. For n=3: 1 + 3 + 6 = 10. Formula: 3*4*5/6 = 60/6 = 10. Correct. For n=4: 1 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 20. Formula: 4*5*6/6 = 120/6 = 20. Correct. Seems to work. 

But maybe I should think of another way to derive this formula, just to confirm. Maybe using induction? Let's try induction. 

Base case n=1: sum is 1, formula gives 1(2)(3)/6 = 1. True. Assume true for n=k: sum_{i=1}^k t_i = k(k + 1)(k + 2)/6. Then for n=k+1, the sum is sum_{i=1}^{k+1} t_i = sum_{i=1}^k t_i + t_{k+1} = [k(k + 1)(k + 2)/6] + [(k + 1)(k + 2)/2]. Let's compute this:

Factor out (k + 1)(k + 2)/6: [k(k + 1)(k + 2) + 3(k + 1)(k + 2)] / 6 = [ (k + 1)(k + 2)(k + 3) ] / 6. Which is the formula for n=k+1. Hence, by induction, the formula holds for all n ≥ 1. 

So that works. Alternatively, maybe there's a combinatorial interpretation? Triangular numbers are related to combinations. The formula for t_k is C(k + 1, 2). So, the sum S = Σ_{k=1}^n C(k + 1, 2). There's a formula for the sum of combinations. 

Recall that Σ_{k=0}^n C(k + r, r) = C(n + r + 1, r + 1). Is that a known identity? Let me check. For example, if r=1, then Σ_{k=0}^n C(k + 1, 1) = Σ_{k=0}^n (k + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 = C(n + 2, 2). Which is correct. So, in general, Σ_{k=0}^n C(k + r, r) = C(n + r + 1, r + 1). 

In our case, the sum S is Σ_{k=1}^n C(k + 1, 2). Let me adjust indices. Let m = k + 1. When k=1, m=2; when k=n, m=n+1. So S = Σ_{m=2}^{n+1} C(m, 2) = Σ_{m=0}^{n+1} C(m, 2) - C(0, 2) - C(1, 2). But C(0, 2) and C(1, 2) are both zero, since you can't choose 2 elements from 0 or 1. Therefore, S = Σ_{m=0}^{n+1} C(m, 2) = C(n + 1 + 1, 2 + 1) = C(n + 2, 3). 

But C(n + 2, 3) is (n + 2)(n + 1)n / 6, which is exactly the formula we have. Therefore, that gives another derivation. 

So, that's a combinatorial approach. So, the sum of triangular numbers up to n is equal to the combination C(n + 2, 3), which expands to the formula given. 

Alternatively, maybe using generating functions? Let me think. The generating function for triangular numbers is known? Well, since t_k = k(k + 1)/2, so generating function would be Σ_{k=1}^∞ t_k x^k = Σ_{k=1}^∞ [k(k + 1)/2] x^k. But maybe this is more complicated. However, if we need the sum up to n, perhaps we can find the generating function and then find the coefficient? Maybe not necessary here, since we already have two derivations. 

Alternatively, maybe telescoping series? Not sure. Let me think. 

Alternatively, think of the triangular numbers as layers in some geometric figure? For example, the sum of triangular numbers might correspond to tetrahedral numbers. Wait, yes! The sum of the first n triangular numbers is the nth tetrahedral number. And the formula for tetrahedral numbers is indeed n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6. Which is the same as the formula given. 

So, if I think of stacking triangular numbers to form a tetrahedron, then the formula makes sense. But how to derive it? Well, maybe using the concept of counting the number of ways to choose 3 items from n + 2? Wait, that's the combinatorial argument again. 

Alternatively, using recursion? Let me see. Suppose S(n) = S(n - 1) + t_n. And we have S(n) = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6. Let me check if this satisfies the recurrence. 

Let me compute S(n) - S(n - 1) = [n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6] - [(n - 1)n(n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)/6][ (n + 2) - (n - 1) ] = [n(n + 1)/6][3] = n(n + 1)/2, which is t_n. So that checks out. So the recurrence is satisfied. 

But this is more of a verification rather than a derivation. 

Alternatively, think of the formula as a cubic polynomial. Since the sum of triangular numbers is a cubic in n, we can assume that S(n) = an³ + bn² + cn + d. Then, using known values for n=1,2,3,4, we can solve for a, b, c, d.
