 Let's denote the number of calves, lambs, and piglets as $c$, $l$, and $p$ respectively. We know that the total number of animals is 100, so we have the equation:

$c + l + p = 100$

We also know that the total cost of the animals is $4000, and the prices of each type of animal are $120, $50, and $25 respectively. So we have the equation:

$120c + 50l + 25p = 4000$

We can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 25:

$4.8c + 2l + p = 160$

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. $c + l + p = 100$
2. $4.8c + 2l + p = 160$

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate $p$:

$4.8c + 2l + p - (c + l + p) = 160 - 100$

This simplifies to:

$3.8c + l = 60$

Since $c$, $l$, and $p$ are all integers (we can't have a fraction of an animal), we can try different values of $c$ and $l$ to see which ones satisfy this equation. 

If we let $c = 10$, we can solve for $l$:

$3.8(10) + l = 60$

$38 + l = 60$

$l = 60 - 38 = 22$

So one possible solution is $c = 10$, $l = 22$, and $p = 100 - 10 - 22 = 68$.

We can check this solution by substituting it back into the original equations:

$120(10) + 50(22) + 25(68) = 1200 + 1100 + 1700 = 4000$ (which is true)

$10 + 22 + 68 = 100$ (which is also true)

So this solution is valid.

Therefore, the farmer bought 10 calves, 22 lambs, and 68 piglets.
