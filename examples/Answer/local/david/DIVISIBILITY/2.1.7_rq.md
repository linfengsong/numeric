Okay, so I need to show that the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is always a cube. Hmm, let me start by recalling what triangular numbers are. 

Triangular numbers are numbers that can form an equilateral triangle. The nth triangular number, usually denoted as T_n, is the sum of the first n natural numbers. The formula for the nth triangular number is T_n = n(n + 1)/2. Let me verify that. For example, T_1 = 1(1+1)/2 = 1, which is correct. T_2 = 2(2+1)/2 = 3, which is also correct. T_3 = 3(4)/2 = 6, and so on. Yeah, that seems right.

So the problem is about the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers. Let me write that down. Let's say we have two consecutive triangular numbers, T_n and T_{n+1}. The difference between their squares would be [T_{n+1}]^2 - [T_n]^2. Wait, but the problem says "the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is always a cube." So maybe it's not necessarily T_{n+1} squared minus T_n squared, but maybe the absolute difference? But since T_{n+1} is larger than T_n, the difference would be positive. So I think the problem is referring to [T_{n+1}]^2 - [T_n]^2. 

So my task is to show that this difference is a cube. Let me compute this difference using the formula for triangular numbers.

First, let me write down T_n and T_{n+1}:

T_n = n(n + 1)/2

T_{n+1} = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2

Therefore, the difference of their squares is:

[T_{n+1}]^2 - [T_n]^2 = [(n + 1)(n + 2)/2]^2 - [n(n + 1)/2]^2

Hmm, this looks like a difference of squares, so maybe I can factor it. Remember that a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Let me apply that here.

Let me denote a = [(n + 1)(n + 2)/2] and b = [n(n + 1)/2]. Then the difference is (a - b)(a + b). Let me compute a - b and a + b.

First, compute a - b:

a - b = [(n + 1)(n + 2)/2] - [n(n + 1)/2] 

Factor out (n + 1)/2:

= (n + 1)/2 [ (n + 2) - n ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

(n + 2) - n = 2

So, a - b = (n + 1)/2 * 2 = (n + 1)

Okay, that's nice. Now compute a + b:

a + b = [(n + 1)(n + 2)/2] + [n(n + 1)/2]

Again, factor out (n + 1)/2:

= (n + 1)/2 [ (n + 2) + n ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

(n + 2) + n = 2n + 2 = 2(n + 1)

Therefore, a + b = (n + 1)/2 * 2(n + 1) = (n + 1)^2

So putting it all together, the difference of squares is:

(a - b)(a + b) = (n + 1) * (n + 1)^2 = (n + 1)^3

Oh! So the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is (n + 1)^3, which is a cube. Therefore, it's always a cube. 

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check with an example to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's take n = 1. Then T_1 = 1, T_2 = 3. The difference of squares is 3² - 1² = 9 - 1 = 8. Which is 2³, and indeed n + 1 = 2, so 2³ = 8. Correct.

Another example: n = 2. T_2 = 3, T_3 = 6. Difference of squares: 6² - 3² = 36 - 9 = 27. Which is 3³. And n + 1 = 3, so 3³ = 27. Correct again.

Another one: n = 3. T_3 = 6, T_4 = 10. Difference of squares: 10² - 6² = 100 - 36 = 64. Which is 4³. And n + 1 = 4, so 4³ = 64. Perfect. 

So the algebra checks out with examples. Therefore, the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is indeed (n + 1)^3, which is a cube. Therefore, the statement is proven.

But let me just make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors in the algebra. Let me go through the steps again.

Starting with T_n = n(n + 1)/2 and T_{n+1} = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Then [T_{n+1}]^2 - [T_n]^2 is equal to [(n + 1)(n + 2)/2]^2 - [n(n + 1)/2]^2. Factoring as difference of squares gives [(n + 1)(n + 2)/2 - n(n + 1)/2] * [(n + 1)(n + 2)/2 + n(n + 1)/2]. 

Calculating the first factor: [(n + 1)/2][(n + 2) - n] = [(n + 1)/2][2] = n + 1. 

Second factor: [(n + 1)/2][(n + 2) + n] = [(n + 1)/2][2n + 2] = [(n + 1)/2][2(n + 1)] = (n + 1)^2. 

Multiplying the two factors: (n + 1)*(n + 1)^2 = (n + 1)^3. 

Yes, that's correct. So the difference is indeed (n + 1)^3. Therefore, regardless of the value of n, this difference is a cube. 

Therefore, the problem is solved. 

But just to be thorough, let me check one more example with n = 4. T_4 = 10, T_5 = 15. Difference of squares: 15² - 10² = 225 - 100 = 125, which is 5³. And n + 1 = 5, so 5³ = 125. Correct again. 

Another example, n = 5. T_5 = 15, T_6 = 21. 21² - 15² = 441 - 225 = 216. Which is 6³. And n + 1 = 6. Correct. 

So all examples check out. Therefore, the conclusion is correct. 

Therefore, the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is always a cube, specifically (n + 1)^3. 

I think that's all. The key was recognizing the difference of squares and factoring it, then simplifying each part. It's a neat result, and the algebra works out nicely. 

**Final Answer**
The difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is always a cube, specifically \boxed{(n+1)^3}.
</think>

To show that the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers is always a cube, we begin by recalling the formula for the $n$th triangular number:

$$
T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

The next triangular number is:

$$
T_{n+1} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}
$$

We are asked to compute the difference between the squares of these two consecutive triangular numbers:

$$
[T_{n+1}]^2 - [T_n]^2
$$

This expression is a **difference of squares**, which can be factored as:

$$
[T_{n+1}]^2 - [T_n]^2 = (T_{n+1} - T_n)(T_{n+1} + T_n)
$$

### Step 1: Compute $T_{n+1} - T_n$

$$
T_{n+1} - T_n = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

Factor out $\frac{n+1}{2}$:

$$
= \frac{n+1}{2} \left[(n+2) - n\right] = \frac{n+1}{2} \cdot 2 = n+1
$$

---

### Step 2: Compute $T_{n+1} + T_n$

$$
T_{n+1} + T_n = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

Factor out $\frac{n+1}{2}$:

$$
= \frac{n+1}{2} \left[(n+2) + n\right
