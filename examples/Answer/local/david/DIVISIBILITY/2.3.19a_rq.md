Okay, so I need to prove that for any integer a, 6 divides a(a² + 11). Hmm, let me think. First, since 6 is 2 times 3, maybe I can show that the expression is divisible by both 2 and 3. If I can show that, then by the property of divisibility, it must be divisible by 6. Yeah, that makes sense. Let me try that approach.

Starting with divisibility by 2. Let me consider the expression a(a² + 11). Let me analyze whether this is even. Let's think about the parity of a. If a is even, then a is divisible by 2, so the entire expression is even. If a is odd, then let's see what happens. If a is odd, then a² is also odd because odd times odd is odd. Then 11 is odd, so odd + odd is even. Therefore, a² + 11 is even. Therefore, if a is odd, then a² + 11 is even, so the entire expression is odd times even, which is even. So regardless of whether a is even or odd, the expression a(a² + 11) is even. Therefore, divisible by 2. Okay, that takes care of the 2 part.

Now, moving on to divisibility by 3. So I need to show that 3 divides a(a² + 11). Let me think about this. Let me consider the possible residues of a modulo 3. Since any integer is congruent to 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3. Let me check each case.

Case 1: a ≡ 0 mod 3. Then, a is divisible by 3, so the entire expression is 0*(something) which is 0 mod 3. So that's good.

Case 2: a ≡ 1 mod 3. Then, let's compute a² + 11. a² is 1² = 1 mod 3. Then 11 mod 3 is 2, since 3*3=9, 11-9=2. So 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, a² + 11 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, the entire expression is 1*0 = 0 mod 3. So that works.

Case 3: a ≡ 2 mod 3. Then, a² is 2² = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Then again, 11 mod 3 is 2, so 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, a² + 11 ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, the entire expression is 2*0 = 0 mod 3. So that also works.

Therefore, in all cases, the expression is divisible by 3. Therefore, since it's divisible by both 2 and 3, which are coprime, it must be divisible by 6. Therefore, the assertion holds.

Wait, but let me check with some examples to make sure. Let me pick a few integers and see.

Take a = 1: 1*(1 + 11) = 1*12 = 12. 12 is divisible by 6. Good.

a = 2: 2*(4 + 11) = 2*15 = 30. 30 is divisible by 6. Good.

a = 3: 3*(9 + 11) = 3*20 = 60. Divisible by 6. Yep.

a = 4: 4*(16 + 11) = 4*27 = 108. 108 divided by 6 is 18. Yep.

a = 5: 5*(25 + 11) = 5*36 = 180. Divided by 6 is 30. Okay.

Negative numbers? Let's try a = -1: (-1)*(1 + 11) = -12. Which is divisible by 6. Yes.

a = -2: (-2)*(4 + 11) = -2*15 = -30. Divisible by 6. Yep.

So examples seem to check out. But maybe I should think of another approach to confirm. Maybe expanding the expression?

Let me try expanding a(a² + 11). That would be a³ + 11a. So we need to show that 6 divides a³ + 11a. Alternatively, maybe we can write this as a³ + 11a = a³ - a + 12a. Wait, because 11a = -a + 12a. Then, a³ - a + 12a. So a³ - a is something familiar. Let me recall that a³ - a factors as a(a² - 1) = a(a - 1)(a + 1). Which is the product of three consecutive integers. Therefore, divisible by 2 and 3. So a³ - a is divisible by 6. Therefore, if I have a³ - a + 12a, then since 12a is obviously divisible by 6, then the entire expression is divisible by 6. Therefore, this shows that a³ + 11a is divisible by 6. Therefore, the original expression is divisible by 6. So that's another way to see it. That's a good approach. So that's another way to think about it. So maybe that's a more algebraic approach.

So, since a³ - a is divisible by 6, then adding 12a (which is divisible by 6) will still keep the divisibility by 6. Therefore, the entire expression is divisible by 6. Therefore, that's another way to see it. So that seems to confirm the result.

Alternatively, maybe using modular arithmetic for the divisibility by 3. Let me think again. For divisibility by 3, we can think of a³ + 11a modulo 3. Since 11 ≡ 2 mod 3, so a³ + 2a mod 3. Let me check if this is 0 for all a. Let me check for a ≡ 0,1,2 mod 3.

If a ≡ 0 mod 3: 0 + 0 = 0 mod 3. Good.

If a ≡ 1 mod 3: 1 + 2*1 = 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. Good.

If a ≡ 2 mod 3: 8 + 2*2 = 8 + 4 = 12 ≡ 0 mod 3. Wait, 2³ is 8, which is 2 mod 3 (since 8-6=2). So 2 + 2*2 = 2 + 4 = 6 ≡ 0 mod 3. So yes, that works. Therefore, regardless of a, a³ + 11a ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, divisible by 3. And since we already saw it's divisible by 2, so overall divisible by 6. So that works.

Alternatively, since we have that a³ - a is divisible by 6, then a³ + 11a = (a³ - a) + 12a, and since both terms are divisible by 6, then the whole thing is divisible by 6. That's another way to think about it.

So, both approaches confirm that the expression is divisible by 6. Therefore, the assertion is established.

Wait, but maybe I can think of another way. Let me try to use mathematical induction. Although, induction is usually for statements about natural numbers, but since the problem says "arbitrary integer", maybe I can do it for non-negative integers and then handle negatives? But maybe it's overkill. However, let me try.

Base case: a = 0. Then 0*(0 + 11) = 0. 0 is divisible by 6. Okay.

Assume that for some integer k, the statement holds. Then for k + 1? Wait, but induction for integers can be tricky because of negative numbers. Maybe it's better to do induction for non-negative integers and then note that for negative integers, since the expression is a(a² + 11), and if a is negative, then let me write a = -b, where b is positive. Then the expression becomes (-b)(b² + 11) = -b(b² + 11). Which is the negative of b(b² + 11). Since b(b² + 11) is divisible by 6, then its negative is also divisible by 6. Therefore, if the statement holds for positive integers, it holds for negative integers as well. Therefore, maybe induction on positive integers.

Base case: a = 1, already checked. 1*(1 + 11) = 12, divisible by 6. Assume for a = k, k³ + 11k is divisible by 6. Then for a = k + 1, we have (k + 1)^3 + 11(k + 1). Let me expand that:

(k + 1)^3 + 11(k + 1) = k³ + 3k² + 3k + 1 + 11k + 11 = k³ + 3k² + 14k + 12.

Now, compare this to the previous term, which was k³ + 11k. The difference between these two expressions is:

(k³ + 3k² + 14k + 12) - (k³ + 11k) = 3k² + 3k + 12.

So, if we can show that 3k² + 3k + 12 is divisible by 6, then since the previous term is divisible by 6, the next term will be as well. Let me check:

3k² + 3k + 12 = 3(k² + k) + 12.

Now, k² + k = k(k + 1), which is the product of two consecutive integers, hence divisible by 2. Therefore, k² + k is even, so 3(k² + k) is divisible by 3*2 = 6. Then 12 is also divisible by 6. Therefore, the entire expression 3(k² + k) + 12 is divisible by 6. Therefore, the difference is divisible by 6, so since the original term was divisible by 6, the next term is also divisible by 6. Therefore, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers. Therefore, since we have covered negative integers as well, the statement holds for all integers. Therefore, that's another way to see it.

But this seems more complicated than the previous methods. So maybe the first approach of checking divisibility by 2 and 3 is more straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that for any integer a, a³ ≡ a mod 3 and a³ ≡ a mod 2. Wait, let me think. For modulus 2, a³ ≡ a mod 2. Because if a is even, then a³ is even, and if a is odd, a³ is odd. Similarly, for modulus 3, Fermat's little theorem says that a³ ≡ a mod 3. So, in general, a³ ≡ a mod 6? Wait, not sure. But if we consider modulus 2 and 3.

But let me think. Since for modulus 2, a³ ≡ a mod 2, so a³ - a ≡ 0 mod 2. Similarly, for modulus 3, a³ ≡ a mod 3, so a³ - a ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, a³ - a is divisible by both 2 and 3, hence by 6. Therefore, a³ - a is divisible by 6. Therefore, as before, a³ + 11a = (a³ - a) + 12a, which is divisible by 6. Therefore, this is another way to see it, using Fermat's little theorem. So, that's a more advanced approach, but still valid.

But since the problem says "establish each of the assertions", so maybe the first method of checking divisibility by 2 and 3 is the most elementary.

Alternatively, maybe considering the expression a(a² + 11) modulo 6. Let me check for all residues mod 6. Since if we can show that for any residue r mod 6, the expression is 0 mod 6, then it's proven.

So, let me check for a = 0,1,2,3,4,5 mod 6.

Case 0: a ≡ 0 mod 6. Then, expression is 0*(something) = 0 mod 6. Good.

Case 1: a ≡ 1 mod 6. Then, a² + 11 = 1 + 11 = 12 ≡ 0 mod 6. Therefore, expression is 1*0 = 0 mod 6. Good.

Case 2: a ≡ 2 mod 6. Then, a² + 11 = 4 + 11 = 15 ≡ 3 mod 6. Wait, but then the expression is 2*3 = 6 ≡ 0 mod 6. Oh, right, 2*3 = 6, which is 0 mod 6. So that works.

Case 3: a ≡ 3 mod 6. Then, a² + 11 = 9 + 11 = 20 ≡ 2 mod 6. Then, the expression is 3*2 = 6 ≡ 0 mod 6. Good.

Case 4: a ≡ 4 mod 6. Then, a² + 11 = 16 + 11 = 27 ≡ 3 mod 6. Then, the expression is 4*3 = 12 ≡ 0 mod 6. Good.

Case 5: a ≡ 5 mod 6. Then, a² + 11 = 25 + 11 = 36 ≡ 0 mod 6. Then, expression is 5*0 = 0 mod 6. Perfect.

So, for all residues mod 6, the expression is 0 mod 6. Therefore, that proves it. So that's another way, checking all residues. That's also a solid approach.

So, multiple ways to approach this problem. The key is that the expression is divisible by both 2 and 3, hence by 6. Or, by checking all residues mod 6. Or, using algebraic manipulation to factor the expression. Or, using induction. Each approach confirms the result.

Therefore, I think the assertion is established.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{6} divides $a(a^2 + 11)$ for any integer $a$, so the assertion is proven.
</think>

To establish the assertion that for any integer $ a $, the expression $ a(a^2 + 11) $ is divisible by 6, we proceed by analyzing divisibility by the prime factors of 6: namely, 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 are coprime, showing that the expression is divisible by both will suffice to conclude that it is divisible by 6.

### **Step 1: Divisibility by 2**

We examine the expression $ a(a^2 + 11) $ for even and odd values of $ a $:

- If $ a $ is even, then $ a $ is divisible by 2, so the entire expression is even.
- If $ a $ is odd, then $ a^2 $ is also odd (since the square of an odd number is odd), and 11 is odd. Therefore, $ a^2 + 11 $ is even (odd + odd = even). Thus, the product $ a(a^2 + 11) $ is odd × even = even.

In either case, the expression is even, so it is divisible by 2.

### **Step 2: Divisibility by 3**

We analyze the expression modulo 3. Consider all possible residues of $ a $ modulo 3: $ 0, 1, 2 $.

- **Case 1:** $ a \equiv 0 \mod 3 $  
  Then $ a $ is divisible by 3, so $ a(a^2 + 11) \equiv 0 \mod 3 $.

- **Case 2:** $ a \equiv 1 \mod 3 $  
  Then $ a^2 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $, and $ 11 \equiv 2 \mod 3 $, so $ a^2 + 11 \equiv 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $. Thus, the expression is $ 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \mod 3 $.

- **Case 3:** $ a \equiv 2 \mod 3 $  
  Then $ a^2 \equiv 4 \equiv 1 \mod 3 $, and again $ 11 \equiv 2 \mod 3 $, so $ a^2 + 11 \equiv 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 0 \mod 3 $. Thus, the expression is $ 2 \cdot 0 = 0 \mod 3 $.

In all three cases, the expression is divisible by 3.

### **Conclusion**

Since the expression $ a(a^2 + 11) $ is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by their least common multiple, which is 6. Therefore, for any integer $ a $, the expression is divisible by 6.
