 To show that the expression $(2n)!/2^nn!$ is an integer for all $n \geq 0$, we can use the concept of factorials and combinatorial identities.

First, let's rewrite the expression as a ratio of factorials:

$$\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}$$

Now, let's consider the numerator, $(2n)!$. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number. So, $(2n)! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (2n)$.

Next, let's consider the denominator, $2^n n!$. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number. So, $n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot n$. And $2^n$ is simply $2$ multiplied by itself $n$ times.

Now, let's rewrite the expression as a ratio of factorials:

$$\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!} = \frac{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (2n)}{2^n \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot n}$$

We can see that the denominator contains all the factors in the numerator, but some of them are multiplied by $2$. Specifically, the factors $2, 4, 6, \ldots, 2n$ are multiplied by $2$ in the denominator.

Now, let's consider the prime factorization of the numerator and the denominator. The prime factorization of a number is the expression of that number as a product of prime numbers.

The prime factorization of the numerator is:

$$1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (2n) = 2^0 \cdot 2^1 \cdot 2^2 \cdot \ldots \cdot 2^{2n-1} \cdot 3^0 \cdot 3^1 \cdot \ldots \cdot p^{k_n}$$

where $p$ is a prime number and $k_n$ is the highest power of $p$ that divides $2n$.

The prime factorization of the denominator is:

$$2^n \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot n = 2^n \cdot 2^0 \cdot 2^1 \cdot 2^2 \cdot \ldots \cdot 2^{n-1} \cdot 3^0 \cdot 3^1 \cdot \ldots \cdot p^{k_n}$$

We can see that the prime factorization of the denominator contains all the prime factors of the numerator, but some of them are multiplied by $2$. Specifically, the prime factors $2, 4, 6, \ldots, 2n$ are multiplied by $2$ in the denominator.

Since the prime factorization of the denominator contains all the prime factors of the numerator, and some of them are multiplied by $2$, the expression $(2n)!/(2^n n!)$ is an integer for all $n \geq 0$.

Therefore, we have shown that the expression $(2n)!/2^nn!$ is an integer for all $n \geq 0$.
