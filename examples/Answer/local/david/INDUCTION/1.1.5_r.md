 (a) We can start by trying out some values of n and see if n! + 1 is a perfect square.
For n = 1, 1! + 1 = 2, which is not a perfect square.
For n = 2, 2! + 1 = 3, which is not a perfect square.
For n = 3, 3! + 1 = 7, which is not a perfect square.
For n = 4, 4! + 1 = 25, which is a perfect square (5^2).
For n = 5, 5! + 1 = 121, which is a perfect square (11^2).
For n = 6, 6! + 1 = 721, which is not a perfect square.
For n = 7, 7! + 1 = 5041, which is a perfect square (71^2).
So, the values of n for which n! + 1 is a perfect square are n = 4, 5, and 7.

(b) The statement (mn)! = m!n! is false. The factorial of a product is not equal to the product of the factorials.
For example, (2*3)! = 6! = 720, while 2! * 3! = 2 * 6 = 12.
The statement (m + n)! = m! + n! is also false. The factorial of a sum is not equal to the sum of the factorials.
For example, (2 + 3)! = 5! = 120, while 2! + 3! = 2 + 6 = 8.
Therefore, both statements are false.
The answer is $\boxed{false}$.
