 To prove $a_n < 2^n$ for every positive integer n using the Second Principle of Finite Induction, we need to follow these steps:

1. Base Case: Show that the statement holds for the smallest positive integer, which is 1 in this case.
2. Inductive Step: Assume the statement holds for all positive integers up to k, and then show that the statement also holds for k+1.

Let's start with the Base Case:

For n = 1, we have $a_1 = 1 < 2^1 = 2$.
For n = 2, we have $a_2 = 2 < 2^2 = 4$.
For n = 3, we have $a_3 = 3 < 2^3 = 8$.

So, the statement holds for n = 1, 2, and 3.

Now, let's move on to the Inductive Step:

Assume that the statement holds for all positive integers up to k, i.e., $a_k < 2^k$, $a_{k-1} < 2^{k-1}$, and $a_{k-2} < 2^{k-2}$.

We need to show that the statement also holds for k+1, i.e., $a_{k+1} < 2^{k+1}$.

From the definition of the sequence $a_n$, we have $a_{k+1} = a_k + a_{k-1} + a_{k-2}$.

Using the inductive hypothesis, we can write:

$a_{k+1} < 2^k + 2^{k-1} + 2^{k-2}$

Now, we need to show that $2^k + 2^{k-1} + 2^{k-2} < 2^{k+1}$.

Divide both sides of the inequality by $2^{k-2}$:

$2^2 + 2 + 1 < 2^3$

$4 + 2 + 1 < 8$

$7 < 8$

Since the inequality holds, we have shown that if the statement holds for all positive integers up to k, then it also holds for k+1.

By the Second Principle of Finite Induction, the statement $a_n < 2^n$ holds for every positive integer n.
