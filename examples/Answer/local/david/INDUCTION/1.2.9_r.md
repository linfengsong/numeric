 To establish the inequality $2^n < \binom{2n}{n} < 2^{2n}$, for $n > 1$, we will use the concept of mathematical induction.

Base case: For $n = 2$, we have $2^2 < \binom{4}{2} < 2^4$, which simplifies to $4 < 6 < 16$. This is true, so the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume the inequality holds for $n = k$, i.e., $2^k < \binom{2k}{k} < 2^{2k}$. We will now show that the inequality also holds for $n = k+1$.

Consider the left inequality: $2^{k+1} = 2 \cdot 2^k < 2 \cdot \binom{2k}{k} = \binom{2k+1}{k+1} + \binom{2k+1}{k} < \binom{2k+1}{k+1} + \binom{2k+1}{k} = \binom{2(k+1)}{k+1}$.

The first inequality follows from the fact that $2^k < \binom{2k}{k}$, and the second inequality follows from Pascal's identity $\binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k-1} = \binom{n+1}{k}$.

Now consider the right inequality: $\binom{2(k+1)}{k+1} = \binom{2k+2}{k+1} = \binom{2k+2}{k} < 2 \cdot \binom{2k}{k} = 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}$.

The first inequality follows from the fact that $\binom{2k}{k} < 2^{2k}$, and the second inequality follows from the fact that $\binom{n}{k} < 2^n$ for $n > k$.

Thus, the inequality holds for $n = k+1$ as well.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the inequality $2^n < \binom{2n}{n} < 2^{2n}$ holds for all $n > 1$.
