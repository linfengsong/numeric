 To prove the binomial identity, we will use mathematical induction.

Base case (n = 2):
The left-hand side of the equation is $\binom{2}{2} = 1$.
The right-hand side of the equation is $\frac{2(2+1)(4*2-1)}{6} = \frac{6*7}{6} = 7$.
Since 1 ≠ 7, the base case is not true.

Inductive step:
Assume the equation is true for some value of n, i.e.,
$$\binom{2}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{6}{2} + \ldots + \binom{2n}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}$$

We need to prove that the equation is true for n+1, i.e.,
$$\binom{2}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{6}{2} + \ldots + \binom{2n}{2} + \binom{2(n+1)}{2} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)(4(n+1)-1)}{6}$$

Using the inductive hypothesis, we can rewrite the left-hand side of the equation as:
$$\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} + \binom{2(n+1)}{2}$$

Now, we need to show that this is equal to the right-hand side of the equation for n+1:
$$\frac{(n+1)(n+2)(4(n+1)-1)}{6}$$

Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:
$$\frac{(n+1)(n+2)(4n+3)}{6}$$

Now, we need to show that:
$$\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} + \binom{2(n+1)}{2} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)(4n+3)}{6}$$

Simplifying the left-hand side of the equation, we get:
$$\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} + \frac{(n+1)(4n+2)}{2}$$

Combining the fractions, we get:
$$\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1) + 3(n+1)(4n+2)}{6}$$

Factoring out $(n+1)$, we get:
$$\frac{(n+1)[n(4n-1) + 3(4n+2)]}{6}$$

Expanding the expression inside the brackets, we get:
$$\frac{(n+1)(4n^2 - n + 12n + 6)}{6}$$

Simplifying the expression inside the brackets, we get:
$$\frac{(n+1)(4n^2 + 11n + 6)}{6}$$

Expanding the expression, we get:
$$\frac{4n^3 + 11n^2 + 6n + 4n^2 + 11n + 6}{6}$$

Combining like terms, we get:
$$\frac{4n^3 + 15n^2 + 17n + 6}{6}$$

Factoring out a common factor of $(n+1)$, we get:
$$\frac{(n+1)(4n^2 + 11n + 6)}{6}$$

Comparing this to the right-hand side of the equation, we can see that they are equal:
$$\frac{(n+1)(n+2)(4n+3)}{6} = \frac{(n+1)(4n^2 + 11n + 6)}{6}$$

Therefore, the equation is true for n+1.

By mathematical induction, the binomial identity is true for all values of n ≥ 2.
