 (a) First, we prove that an integer n > 1 is square-free if and only if n can be factored into a product of distinct primes.

Suppose n is square-free. Then n is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1. This means that the prime factorization of n contains no repeated primes. Therefore, n can be factored into a product of distinct primes.

Conversely, suppose n can be factored into a product of distinct primes, say n = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_k, where p_i are distinct primes. If n were divisible by the square of an integer greater than 1, then n would be divisible by the square of one of its prime factors, say p_i^2. But this would mean that n is not square-free, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, n is square-free.

(b) Now, we prove that every integer n > 1 is the product of a square-free integer and a perfect square.

Let n be an integer greater than 1. We can write n as the product of its prime factorization: n = p_1^a_1 * p_2^a_2 * ... * p_k^a_k, where p_i are distinct primes and a_i are their respective exponents.

Now, let's define two integers m and s as follows:

m = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_k (the product of all distinct prime factors of n)
s = p_1^(2a_1 - 1) * p_2^(2a_2 - 1) * ... * p_k^(2a_k - 1) (the product of the distinct prime factors of n, each raised to the power of twice its exponent in the prime factorization of n, minus 1)

Notice that s is a perfect square, since each term in its prime factorization has an even exponent.

Now, we have n = m * s. We claim that m is square-free. Suppose, for contradiction, that m is not square-free. Then there exists a prime p and an integer b > 1 such that p^2 divides m. But this would mean that p^2 divides n, which contradicts the fact that n is square-free. Therefore, m is square-free.

Thus, we have shown that every integer n > 1 is the product of a square-free integer (m) and a perfect square (s).
