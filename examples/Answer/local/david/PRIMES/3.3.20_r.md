 To prove that $p^3 + 4$ is prime, we will use the fact that $p$ and $p^2 + 8$ are both prime numbers.

First, let's consider the expression $p^3 + 4$. We can rewrite this expression as $(p^2 - 2p + 4) + 2p + 4$.

Now, let's analyze the two terms separately:

1. $p^2 - 2p + 4$: This is a quadratic expression. Since $p$ is a prime number, $p^2 - 2p + 4$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. This means that there exists an integer $x$ such that $x^2 \equiv p^2 - 2p + 4 \pmod{p}$.

2. $2p + 4$: This expression is divisible by $2$, so it is not prime.

Now, let's consider the sum of these two terms: $(p^2 - 2p + 4) + 2p + 4 = p^2 + 8$.

Since $p$ and $p^2 + 8$ are both prime numbers, we know that $p^2 + 8$ is not divisible by $2$. Therefore, $p^2 + 8$ is an odd number.

Now, let's consider the expression $p^3 + 4$. We can rewrite this expression as $(p^2 - 2p + 4) + 2p + 4$. Since $p^2 + 8$ is an odd number, we know that $p^2 - 2p + 4$ is also an odd number. Therefore, $p^3 + 4$ is the sum of an odd number and an even number, which means that $p^3 + 4$ is an odd number.

Since $p^3 + 4$ is an odd number and is not divisible by $2$, we can conclude that $p^3 + 4$ is a prime number.

Therefore, if $p$ and $p^2 + 8$ are both prime numbers, then $p^3 + 4$ is also prime.
