 To modify Euclid's proof, we will assume the existence of a largest prime p and use the integer N = p! + 1 to arrive at a contradiction.

First, let's recall Euclid's original proof:

Euclid's proof:

1. Assume that there are only finitely many prime numbers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.
2. Let P be the product of all these primes: P = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n.
3. Consider the number N = P + 1.
4. N is not divisible by any of the primes p_1, p_2, ..., p_n, because when we divide N by any of these primes, we get a remainder of 1.
5. Therefore, N is either a prime number itself or has a prime factor that is not in the list of primes p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.
6. This contradicts our assumption that there are only finitely many prime numbers.
7. Therefore, there must be infinitely many prime numbers.

Now, let's modify the proof using the integer N = p! + 1:

1. Assume the existence of a largest prime p.
2. Let N = p! + 1.
3. N is not divisible by any prime less than or equal to p, because when we divide N by any of these primes, we get a remainder of 1.
4. Therefore, N is either a prime number itself or has a prime factor that is greater than p.
5. This contradicts our assumption that p is the largest prime.
6. Therefore, there must be no largest prime.

This modification of Euclid's proof shows that there is no largest prime, which is the same conclusion as Euclid's original proof. However, it uses a different approach and arrives at the same conclusion.
