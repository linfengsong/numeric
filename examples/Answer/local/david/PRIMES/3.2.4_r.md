 (a) To establish that $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational for any prime p, we can use proof by contradiction. Suppose $\sqrt{p}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt{p}$ can be expressed as a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., a and b are coprime), and $b \neq 0$. Squaring both sides of the equation $\sqrt{p} = \frac{a}{b}$, we get $p = \frac{a^2}{b^2}$, or $a^2 = pb^2$. This means that p divides $a^2$, and since p is prime, p must divide a. Let $a = pc$, where c is an integer. Substituting this into the equation $a^2 = pb^2$, we get $(pc)^2 = pb^2$, or $p^2c^2 = pb^2$. Dividing both sides by p, we get $pc^2 = b^2$. This means that p divides $b^2$, and since p is prime, p must divide b. But this contradicts our assumption that a and b have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, our assumption that $\sqrt{p}$ is rational must be false, and $\sqrt{p}$ must be irrational for any prime p.

(b) If $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is rational, then it can be expressed as a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., a and b are coprime), and $b \neq 0$. If $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is an integer, then $a = k^n$ for some integer k. But this means that $a^n = k^{n^2}$, or $a^n = a^{n^2}$. Since $n^2 > n$ for $n \geq 2$, this implies that $a^{n^2 - n} = 1$, or $a^{n(n-1)} = 1$. Since a is an integer, this means that a must be 1 or -1. But if a is 1 or -1, then $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is an integer.

(c) To establish that $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is irrational for $n \geq 2$, we can use proof by contradiction. Suppose $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt[n]{n}$ can be expressed as a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1 (i.e., a and b are coprime), and $b \neq 0$. But this contradicts part (b) of the problem, since $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is not an integer for $n \geq 2$. Therefore, our assumption that $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is rational must be false, and $\sqrt[n]{n}$ must be irrational for $n \geq 2$.
