 The proof is correct as it is. The missing details are already provided in the proof. The sentence "Because A + B > 1, A + B has a prime divisor different from any of the $p_k$ which is a contradiction" is the missing part of the proof. This is because if A + B has a prime divisor different from any of the $p_k$, then we have a prime number that is not in our original list of primes, which contradicts our assumption that there are only finitely many primes. Therefore, our assumption that there are only finitely many primes must be false, and there must be infinitely many primes.
