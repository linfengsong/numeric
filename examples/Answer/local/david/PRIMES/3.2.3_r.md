 To prove this, we will use the fact that if a number n is not prime, then it must have a prime factor p such that $p^2 \leq n$.

Let's assume that n is not prime. Then, it must have a prime factor p such that $p^2 \leq n$. Since $p \leq \sqrt[3]{n}$, we have $p^3 \leq n$.

Now, let's consider the prime factorization of n, which can be written as $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_k$ are their respective exponents.

Since $p^3 \leq n$, we know that $p$ must be one of the prime factors of n. Without loss of generality, let's assume that $p = p_1$. Then, we have $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_1^3 \leq n$.

Now, let's consider the prime factorization of $n/p_1$, which can be written as $(n/p_1) = p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$. Since $p_1^3 \leq n$, we have $p_1^2 \leq n/p_1$.

Since $p_1$ is a prime factor of $n/p_1$, we know that $n/p_1$ is not prime. Therefore, it must have a prime factor $p_2$ such that $p_2^2 \leq n/p_1$. This implies that $p_2^2 \leq n$.

Now, we have $n = p_1p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_1^2 \leq n$ and $p_2^2 \leq n$. Thus, n is the product of two primes, $p_1$ and $p_2$.

In conclusion, if n is not prime, then it must be the product of two primes. Since n was assumed to be not prime, we have shown that n is either a prime or the product of two primes.
