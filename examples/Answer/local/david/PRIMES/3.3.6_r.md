 To prove that the Goldbach conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes, we will show that if one of these statements is true, then the other must also be true.

First, let's assume that the Goldbach conjecture is true, which means that every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. Now, let's take an arbitrary integer greater than 5, say n. We know that n is odd, so we can add 2 to it to make it even. Now, we have an even integer greater than 2, which we can represent as n + 2.

Since the Goldbach conjecture is true, n + 2 can be written as the sum of two primes, say p and q. Therefore, we have n + 2 = p + q, which implies n = p + q - 2. This shows that every integer greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes (p, q, and 2).

Now, let's assume that the statement that every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes is true. We want to show that the Goldbach conjecture must also be true. Let's take an arbitrary even integer greater than 2, say m. Since m is even, we can subtract 2 from it to make it even and greater than 5. Now, we have an even integer greater than 5, which we can represent as m - 2.

Since the statement that every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes is true, m - 2 can be written as the sum of three primes, say p, q, and r. Therefore, we have m - 2 = p + q + r, which implies m = p + q + r + 2. This shows that every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes (p and q) since r and 2 are fixed.

Thus, we have shown that if one of these statements is true, then the other must also be true. Therefore, the Goldbach conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes.
