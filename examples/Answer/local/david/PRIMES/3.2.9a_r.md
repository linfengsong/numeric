 To prove this, we will use the concept of prime numbers and factorials.

First, let's recall the definition of a prime number: a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

Now, let's consider the factorial of a number n, denoted as n!. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

We are given that n > 2. Let's consider the number n! - 1. This number is clearly greater than 1, as n! is a product of positive integers and subtracting 1 from it will result in a number greater than 1.

Now, we need to show that there exists a prime number p such that n < p < n! - 1. To do this, we will use the fact that every integer greater than 1 has a prime factor. This is known as the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

Let's consider the prime factors of n! - 1. Since n! - 1 > 1, it must have at least one prime factor. Let's denote the smallest prime factor of n! - 1 as p.

We know that p is a prime number, and it is a factor of n! - 1. This means that p divides n! - 1. Since p is a factor of n! - 1, it must be the case that n! - 1 is divisible by p.

Now, let's consider the division of n! - 1 by p. We have:

n! - 1 = kp, where k is an integer.

Adding 1 to both sides of the equation, we get:

n! = kp + 1.

Since n! is a product of positive integers, it must be greater than or equal to the smallest prime factor p. Therefore, we have:

n! ≥ p.

However, we know that n! - 1 is divisible by p, so:

n! - 1 + 1 = n! = kp.

Since n! - 1 < n!, we have:

n! - 1 < kp.

Combining the inequalities, we get:

n! - 1 < kp ≤ n!.

Since n! - 1 < n!, we can conclude that n < p < n!.

Thus, we have proven that if n > 2, then there exists a prime p satisfying n < p < n!.
