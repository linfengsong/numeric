 To show that there are infinitely many primes of the form 6n + 5, we will use a proof by contradiction. We will assume that there are only finitely many primes of this form and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.

Assume that there are only finitely many primes of the form 6n + 5, and let's list them as p_1, p_2, ..., p_k. Now, consider the number N = 6(p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_k) + 5. This number is clearly of the form 6n + 5, and it is also clearly larger than any of the primes p_i in our list.

Now, we will show that N is not divisible by any of the primes p_i. To do this, we will use the property that if a prime p divides the product of two numbers a and b, then p must divide at least one of a or b.

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that N is divisible by some prime p_i. Then, p_i must divide 6(p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_k) and p_i must also divide 5. However, 5 is a prime number and is not divisible by any other prime number, so p_i must be equal to 5.

But if p_i = 5, then 5 must divide 6(p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_k), which means that 5 must divide p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_k. This is a contradiction, because 5 is a prime number and cannot divide the product of other primes without dividing one of them.

Therefore, our assumption that N is divisible by some prime p_i must be false. This means that N is a prime number of the form 6n + 5 that is not in our list. But this contradicts our assumption that there are only finitely many primes of this form.

Hence, our assumption must be false, and there must be infinitely many primes of the form 6n + 5.
