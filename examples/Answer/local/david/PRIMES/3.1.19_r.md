 Let $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ be the prime factorization of $n$. Since $n$ is square-full, we have $p_i^{2e_i}|n$ for all $i$. Therefore, we can write $n = p_1^{2e_1}p_2^{2e_2}\cdots p_k^{2e_k} = (p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\cdots p_k^{e_k})^2 = a^2$, where $a = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\cdots p_k^{e_k}$.

Now, let's consider the prime factorization of $a$. We have $a = p_1^{f_1}p_2^{f_2}\cdots p_k^{f_k}$, where $f_i = e_i$ for all $i$. Since $a$ is square-full, we have $p_i^{2f_i}|a$ for all $i$. Therefore, we can write $a = p_1^{2f_1}p_2^{2f_2}\cdots p_k^{2f_k} = (p_1^{f_1}p_2^{f_2}\cdots p_k^{f_k})^2 = b^2$, where $b = p_1^{f_1}p_2^{f_2}\cdots p_k^{f_k}$.

Thus, we have $n = a^2 = (b^2)^2 = b^4$, which is of the form $n = a^2b^3$ with $a = b^2$ and $b = b$. Therefore, if $n$ is square-full, it can be written in the form $n = a^2b^3$, with $a$ and $b$ positive integers.
