 To prove this inequality, we will use the concept of prime numbers and the properties of prime factorization.

First, let's recall the definition of prime numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

Now, let's consider the inequality $p_{n+3}^2 < p_np_{n+1}p_{n+2}$. We will prove this inequality for $n = 1, 2, 3$.

Case 1: $n = 1$
In this case, we have $p_{1+3}^2 < p_1p_{1+1}p_{1+2}$, which simplifies to $p_4^2 < p_1p_2p_3$. We know that $p_1 = 2$, $p_2 = 3$, $p_3 = 5$, and $p_4 = 7$. Substituting these values, we get $7^2 < 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$, which simplifies to $49 < 30$. This is a contradiction, so the inequality does not hold for $n = 1$.

Case 2: $n = 2$
In this case, we have $p_{2+3}^2 < p_2p_{2+1}p_{2+2}$, which simplifies to $p_5^2 < p_2p_3p_4$. We know that $p_2 = 3$, $p_3 = 5$, $p_4 = 7$, and $p_5 = 11$. Substituting these values, we get $11^2 < 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$, which simplifies to $121 < 105$. This is a contradiction, so the inequality does not hold for $n = 2$.

Case 3: $n = 3$
In this case, we have $p_{3+3}^2 < p_3p_{3+1}p_{3+2}$, which simplifies to $p_6^2 < p_3p_4p_5$. We know that $p_3 = 5$, $p_4 = 7$, $p_5 = 11$, and $p_6 = 13$. Substituting these values, we get $13^2 < 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11$, which simplifies to $169 < 385$. This inequality holds true.

Therefore, we have shown that the inequality $p_{n+3}^2 < p_np_{n+1}p_{n+2}$ does not hold for $n = 1$ and $n = 2$, but it holds for $n = 3$.
