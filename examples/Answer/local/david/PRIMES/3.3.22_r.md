 To show that 13 is the largest prime that can divide two successive integers of the form $n^2 + 3$, we will first find a pair of integers of this form that are divisible by 13, and then show that no prime larger than 13 can divide any pair of successive integers of this form.

Let's start by finding a pair of integers of the form $n^2 + 3$ that are divisible by 13. We can do this by trying different values of $n$ and checking if $n^2 + 3$ is divisible by 13.

For $n = 1$, we have $1^2 + 3 = 4$, which is not divisible by 13.

For $n = 2$, we have $2^2 + 3 = 7$, which is not divisible by 13.

For $n = 3$, we have $3^2 + 3 = 12$, which is not divisible by 13.

For $n = 4$, we have $4^2 + 3 = 19$, which is not divisible by 13.

For $n = 5$, we have $5^2 + 3 = 28$, which is not divisible by 13.

For $n = 6$, we have $6^2 + 3 = 39$, which is divisible by 13.

So, we have found a pair of integers of the form $n^2 + 3$ that are divisible by 13: $39$ and $40$.

Now, let's show that no prime larger than 13 can divide any pair of successive integers of this form.

Suppose there exists a prime $p > 13$ that divides a pair of successive integers of the form $n^2 + 3$. Then, there exists an integer $k$ such that $p$ divides both $n^2 + 3$ and $(n + 1)^2 + 3$.

We can write this as:

$n^2 + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$

$(n + 1)^2 + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$

Expanding the second equation, we get:

$n^2 + 2n + 1 + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$

$n^2 + 2n + 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

$2n + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$

$2n \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$

Since $p > 13$, $p$ cannot be a factor of 2. Therefore, we can multiply both sides of the congruence by the modular inverse of 2 modulo $p$, which exists because $p$ is prime. We get:

$n \equiv -\frac{1}{2} \pmod{p}$

Since $n$ is an integer, $-\frac{1}{2}$ must also be an integer modulo $p$. However, this is a contradiction because $p$ is a prime larger than 13, and $-\frac{1}{2}$ is not an integer.

Therefore, no prime larger than 13 can divide any pair of successive integers of the form $n^2 + 3$.

In conclusion, we have shown that 13 is the largest prime that can divide two successive integers of the form $n^2 + 3$.
