 To prove this, we will use the properties of prime factorization and the definition of a square number.

First, let's recall the definition of a square number. A square number is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer with itself. In other words, if n is a square number, then there exists an integer k such that n = k^2.

Now, let's consider a positive integer a > 1, and let its prime factorization be given by:

a = p1^e1 * p2^e2 * p3^e3 * ... * pn^en

where p1, p2, ..., pn are distinct prime numbers, and e1, e2, ..., en are their respective exponents.

We want to show that a is a square if and only if all the exponents e1, e2, ..., en are even integers.

(=>) Suppose a is a square. Then there exists an integer k such that a = k^2. Since the prime factorization is unique, the prime factorization of k^2 must be the same as that of a. 

Let k = p1^f1 * p2^f2 * p3^f3 * ... * pn^fn, where f1, f2, ..., fn are the exponents of the prime factors in the prime factorization of k.

Then, k^2 = (p1^f1 * p2^f2 * p3^f3 * ... * pn^fn)^2 = p1^(2f1) * p2^(2f2) * p3^(2f3) * ... * pn^(2fn).

Comparing the exponents in the prime factorization of a and k^2, we see that the exponents in the prime factorization of a are all even integers (since they are multiplied by 2 in the prime factorization of k^2).

(<=) Suppose all the exponents e1, e2, ..., en are even integers. Then we can write e1 = 2f1, e2 = 2f2, ..., en = 2fn, where f1, f2, ..., fn are integers.

Then, a = p1^e1 * p2^e2 * p3^e3 * ... * pn^en = p1^(2f1) * p2^(2f2) * p3^(2f3) * ... * pn^(2fn) = (p1^f1 * p2^f2 * p3^f3 * ... * pn^fn)^2.

Let k = p1^f1 * p2^f2 * p3^f3 * ... * pn^fn. Then a = k^2, which means a is a square.

Therefore, we have shown that a positive integer a > 1 is a square if and only if in the canonical form of a all the exponents of the primes are even integers.
