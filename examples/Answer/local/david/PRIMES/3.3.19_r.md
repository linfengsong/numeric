 To express an integer as a sum of distinct odd primes, we can use the Goldbach Conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Since the given integers are odd, we can add 2 to each of them to make them even, and then express them as the sum of two prime numbers.

For 25, we have 25 + 2 = 27. The prime factorization of 27 is 3^3, so we can express it as 27 = 3 + 24. Since 24 is not a prime number, we can express it as 24 = 3 + 21, and so on. Continuing this process, we get 27 = 3 + 3 + 18 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 15 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 12 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 9 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3. So, 25 can be expressed as a sum of distinct odd primes as 25 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3.

For 69, we have 69 + 2 = 71, which is a prime number. So, 69 can be expressed as a sum of distinct odd primes as 69 = 71.

For 81, we have 81 + 2 = 83, which is a prime number. So, 81 can be expressed as a sum of distinct odd primes as 81 = 83.

For 125, we have 125 + 2 = 127, which is a prime number. So, 125 can be expressed as a sum of distinct odd primes as 125 = 127.

Therefore, the integers 25, 69, 81, and 125 can be expressed as sums of distinct odd primes as follows:

25 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3
69 = 71
81 = 83
125 = 127
