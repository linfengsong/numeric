 To prove that $n^2 + 2^n$ is composite, we need to show that it has factors other than 1 and itself. We are given that n is an integer not of the form 6k + 3, which means n is not a multiple of 3.

Now, let's consider the expression $n^2 + 2^n$. We can rewrite this expression as $n^2 + 2^n = n^2 + 2^{3k+1}$ for some integer k, since n is not of the form 6k + 3.

We can further rewrite $2^{3k+1}$ as $2^{3k} \cdot 2^1 = 8 \cdot 2^{3k}$.

Now, let's consider the two cases for n:

Case 1: n is even
If n is even, then n can be written as 2m for some integer m. Substituting this into the expression, we get:

$n^2 + 2^n = (2m)^2 + 2^{3k+1} = 4m^2 + 8 \cdot 2^{3k}$

We can factor out a 4 from this expression:

$n^2 + 2^n = 4(m^2 + 2^{3k})$

Since m and $2^{3k}$ are both integers, $m^2 + 2^{3k}$ is also an integer. Therefore, $n^2 + 2^n$ has a factor of 4, which means it is composite.

Case 2: n is odd
If n is odd, then n can be written as 2m + 1 for some integer m. Substituting this into the expression, we get:

$n^2 + 2^n = (2m + 1)^2 + 2^{3k+1} = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 + 8 \cdot 2^{3k}$

We can factor out a 4 from the first two terms:

$n^2 + 2^n = 4(m^2 + m) + 1 + 8 \cdot 2^{3k}$

Since $m^2 + m$ is an integer, $4(m^2 + m)$ is also an integer. Therefore, $n^2 + 2^n$ has a factor of 4, which means it is composite.

In both cases, we have shown that $n^2 + 2^n$ is composite. Therefore, if n > 1 is an integer not of the form 6k + 3, then $n^2 + 2^n$ is composite.
