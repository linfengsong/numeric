 (a) The arithmetic mean of two numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 2. The triangular number 6 is the sum of the first three positive integers, which is 1+2+3=6. So, we are looking for twin primes whose sum is 12. The twin prime pairs whose sum is 12 are (5,7) and (11,13). The mean of 5 and 7 is 6, which is a triangular number. The mean of 11 and 13 is 12, which is not a triangular number. Therefore, there are no other twin primes with a triangular mean.

(b) The arithmetic mean of two numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 2. The perfect square 4 is the square of 2, which is 2*2=4. So, we are looking for twin primes whose sum is 8. The twin prime pairs whose sum is 8 are (3,5) and (5,7). The mean of 3 and 5 is 4, which is a perfect square. The mean of 5 and 7 is 6, which is not a perfect square. Therefore, there are no other twin primes with a square mean.

In conclusion, there are no other twin primes with a triangular mean or a square mean.
