 (a) Let $n = (a + b)(a + 2b) \cdots (a + kb)$ and consider the $k$ terms $a + (n + l)b, a + (n + 2)b, \ldots, a + (n + k)b$. We want to show that these $k$ terms are composite.

By the Euclidean algorithm, we have
\begin{align*}
\text{gcd}(a + (n + l)b, n) &= \text{gcd}(a + (n + l)b, (a + b)(a + 2b) \cdots (a + kb)) \\
&= \text{gcd}(a + (n + l)b, (a + b)(a + 2b) \cdots (a + (l - 1)b)) \\
&= \text{gcd}(a + (n + l)b, a + lb) \\
&= \text{gcd}(a + (n + l)b - (a + lb)b, a + lb) \\
&= \text{gcd}(n + l - lb, a + lb) \\
&= \text{gcd}(n + l - lb, n) \\
&= \text{gcd}(l, n).
\end{align*}
Since $\text{gcd}(a, b) = 1$, we have $\text{gcd}(l, n) = 1$ for $1 \leq l \leq k$. Therefore, the $k$ terms $a + (n + l)b$ are all composite.

(b) We want to find five consecutive composite terms in the arithmetic progression $6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36, \ldots$.

We can start by finding a common difference $b$ such that the first term $a = 6$ and the second term $a + b = 11$ are both prime. We can take $b = 5$. Then the terms are $6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36, \ldots$.

By part (a), the terms $6 + (n + l) \cdot 5$ for $1 \leq l \leq 5$ are all composite, where $n = (6 + 5)(6 + 2 \cdot 5) \cdots (6 + 5 \cdot 5)$.

We can compute $n = 11 \cdot 16 \cdot 21 \cdot 26 \cdot 31 = 2,027,544$.

So the five consecutive composite terms are $6 + (2,027,544 + 1) \cdot 5 = 10,138,721$, $6 + (2,027,544 + 2) \cdot 5 = 10,138,726$, $6 + (2,027,544 + 3) \cdot 5 = 10,138,731$, $6 + (2,027,544 + 4) \cdot 5 = 10,138,736$, and $6 + (2,027,544 + 5) \cdot 5 = 10,138,741$.
