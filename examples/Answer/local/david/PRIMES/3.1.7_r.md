 To find all prime numbers that divide 50!, we need to find all prime numbers less than or equal to 50. The prime numbers less than or equal to 50 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.

Now, we need to find the highest power of each prime number that divides 50!. We can do this by finding the highest power of each prime number that divides any number less than or equal to 50.

1. For the prime number 2, the highest power that divides 50! is given by the highest power of 2 that divides any number less than or equal to 50. We can find this by repeatedly dividing 50 by 2 and summing the quotients:

50 ÷ 2 = 25
25 ÷ 2 = 12.5 (we only consider the integer part, 12)
12 ÷ 2 = 6
6 ÷ 2 = 3
3 ÷ 2 = 1.5 (we only consider the integer part, 1)

So, the highest power of 2 that divides 50! is 25 + 12 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 47.

2. For the prime number 3, the highest power that divides 50! is given by the highest power of 3 that divides any number less than or equal to 50. We can find this by repeatedly dividing 50 by 3 and summing the quotients:

50 ÷ 3 = 16.666... (we only consider the integer part, 16)
16 ÷ 3 = 5.333... (we only consider the integer part, 5)
5 ÷ 3 = 1.666... (we only consider the integer part, 1)

So, the highest power of 3 that divides 50! is 16 + 5 + 1 = 22.

3. For the prime number 5, the highest power that divides 50! is given by the highest power of 5 that divides any number less than or equal to 50. We can find this by repeatedly dividing 50 by 5 and summing the quotients:

50 ÷ 5 = 10
10 ÷ 5 = 2

So, the highest power of 5 that divides 50! is 10 + 2 = 12.

4. For the prime numbers 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47, the highest power that divides 50! is 1, as each of these prime numbers is greater than 50, and therefore does not divide any number less than or equal to 50.

So, the prime numbers that divide 50! are 2, 3, and 5, with their highest powers being 47, 22, and 12, respectively.
