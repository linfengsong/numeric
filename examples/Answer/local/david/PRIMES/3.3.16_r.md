 To find the representations for the primes 23, 29, 31, and 37, we can use the given formulas and the known prime sequence.

1. For $p_{2n} = 23$:

We have $n = 11$, so we need to find the coefficients $\varepsilon_{k}$ for $k = 0$ to $2n - 2 = 20$. We can use the formula $p_{2n} = p_{2n-1} + \sum_{k=0}^{2n-2} \varepsilon_{k}p_k$.

2. For $p_{2n+1} = 29$:

We have $n = 14$, so we need to find the coefficients $\varepsilon_{k}$ for $k = 0$ to $2n - 1 = 27$. We can use the formula $p_{2n+1} = 2p_{2n} + \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} \varepsilon_{k}p_k$.

3. For $p_{2n+1} = 31$:

We have $n = 15$, so we need to find the coefficients $\varepsilon_{k}$ for $k = 0$ to $2n - 1 = 29$. We can use the formula $p_{2n+1} = 2p_{2n} + \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} \varepsilon_{k}p_k$.

4. For $p_{2n+1} = 37$:

We have $n = 18$, so we need to find the coefficients $\varepsilon_{k}$ for $k = 0$ to $2n - 1 = 35$. We can use the formula $p_{2n+1} = 2p_{2n} + \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} \varepsilon_{k}p_k$.

To find the coefficients $\varepsilon_{k}$, we can use a computer program or a calculator with a built-in prime number function. Here are the representations for the primes 23, 29, 31, and 37:

1. $23 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 5 + 7 + 11 - 13 - 17 + 19 + 23$
2. $29 = 2(13) + 1 - 2 - 3 + 5 - 7 - 11 + 13 - 17 + 19 + 23 - 29$
3. $31 = 2(19) - 1 + 2 + 3 - 5 + 7 + 11 - 13 - 17 + 19 - 23 + 29 - 31$
4. $37 = 2(23) + 1 - 2 - 3 + 5 - 7 - 11 + 13 - 17 + 19 + 23 - 29 + 31 - 37$

These are the representations of the primes 23, 29, 31, and 37 using the given formulas.
