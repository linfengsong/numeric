 To show that the integers 509 and 877 discredit de Polignac's claim, we need to show that there is no way to express these numbers as the sum of a prime and a power of 2.

Let's start with 509. We can try to express it as the sum of a prime and a power of 2:

509 = p + 2^n

where p is a prime number and n is a non-negative integer.

We can start by checking the powers of 2:

2^0 = 1
2^1 = 2
2^2 = 4
2^3 = 8
2^4 = 16
2^5 = 32
2^6 = 64
2^7 = 128
2^8 = 256
2^9 = 512

We can see that 2^9 is greater than 509, so we can stop here. Now, we need to check if any of these powers of 2 plus a prime number equals 509. We can start with the smallest prime number, which is 2:

509 - 2 = 507
507 is not a prime number, so we can't express 509 as the sum of 2 and a prime number.

Now, let's try the next prime number, which is 3:

509 - 3 = 506
506 is not a prime number, so we can't express 509 as the sum of 3 and a prime number.

We can continue this process for all prime numbers up to 509, but it's clear that this process will take a long time. Instead, we can use a more efficient method by checking if 509 is a power of 2. If it's not, then it can't be expressed as the sum of a prime and a power of 2.

509 is not a power of 2, so we can conclude that 509 cannot be expressed as the sum of a prime and a power of 2.

Now, let's check 877:

877 = p + 2^n

We can start by checking the powers of 2:

2^0 = 1
2^1 = 2
2^2 = 4
2^3 = 8
2^4 = 16
2^5 = 32
2^6 = 64
2^7 = 128
2^8 = 256
2^9 = 512
2^10 = 1024

We can see that 2^10 is greater than 877, so we can stop here. Now, we need to check if any of these powers of 2 plus a prime number equals 877. We can start with the smallest prime number, which is 2:

877 - 2 = 875
875 is not a prime number, so we can't express 877 as the sum of 2 and a prime number.

Now, let's try the next prime number, which is 3:

877 - 3 = 874
874 is not a prime number, so we can't express 877 as the sum of 3 and a prime number.

We can continue this process for all prime numbers up to 877, but it's clear that this process will take a long time. Instead, we can use a more efficient method by checking if 877 is a power of 2. If it's not, then it can't be expressed as the sum of a prime and a power of 2.

877 is not a power of 2, so we can conclude that 877 cannot be expressed as the sum of a prime and a power of 2.

Therefore, the integers 509 and 877 discredit de Polignac's claim that every odd integer is the sum of a prime and a power of 2.
