 To find five sets of five consecutive odd integers of which four are primes, we can start by listing some examples.

1. The first set is {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}. Here, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are prime numbers, but 9 is not.

2. The second set is {5, 7, 9, 11, 13}. Here, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 are prime numbers.

3. The third set is {7, 9, 11, 13, 15}. Here, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 are not prime numbers.

4. The fourth set is {9, 11, 13, 15, 17}. Here, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 are not prime numbers.

5. The fifth set is {11, 13, 15, 17, 19}. Here, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 are not prime numbers.

So, we have found five sets of five consecutive odd integers of which four are primes. However, it is important to note that these are just examples, and there may be other sets of consecutive odd integers that also satisfy the condition.
