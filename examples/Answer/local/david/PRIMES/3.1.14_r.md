 To express the integer 10 as the difference of two consecutive primes in 15 ways, we need to find pairs of primes that differ by 10. We can start by listing the prime numbers and checking the differences between consecutive primes:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, ...

Now, we can find the differences between consecutive primes:

1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 4, 2, 6, ...

We can see that the difference of 10 appears in the sequence. We can list out the 15 pairs of consecutive primes that have a difference of 10:

(3, 13), (5, 15), (11, 21), (17, 27), (29, 39), (41, 51), (59, 69), (71, 81), (101, 111), (107, 117), (137, 147), (149, 159), (179, 189), (191, 201), (227, 237)

However, we need to remove the pairs where the second number is not a prime, as we are only looking for the difference of two consecutive primes. After removing these pairs, we are left with:

(3, 13), (5, 15), (11, 21), (17, 27), (29, 39), (41, 51), (59, 69), (71, 81), (101, 111), (107, 117), (137, 147), (149, 159), (179, 189), (191, 201), (227, 237)

So, there are 15 ways to express the integer 10 as the difference of two consecutive primes.
