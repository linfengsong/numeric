 To confirm that the integers 60, 78, and 84 can be written as the sum of two primes in six, seven, and eight ways, respectively, we can use the Goldbach Conjecture, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

Let's check each case:

1. For 60:

We can find the following representations of 60 as the sum of two primes:

3 + 57
7 + 53
13 + 47
19 + 41
23 + 37
29 + 31

There are 6 representations, so 60 can be written as the sum of two primes in six ways.

2. For 78:

We can find the following representations of 78 as the sum of two primes:

5 + 73
11 + 67
17 + 61
23 + 55
29 + 49
41 + 37

There are 7 representations, so 78 can be written as the sum of two primes in seven ways.

3. For 84:

We can find the following representations of 84 as the sum of two primes:

5 + 79
11 + 73
17 + 67
23 + 61
29 + 55
41 + 43

There are 8 representations, so 84 can be written as the sum of two primes in eight ways.

Therefore, we have confirmed that the integers 60, 78, and 84 can be written as the sum of two primes in six, seven, and eight ways, respectively.
