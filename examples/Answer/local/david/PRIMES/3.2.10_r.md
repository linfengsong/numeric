 To confirm the conjecture, we need to find the smallest prime greater than $P_n = p_1p_2\cdots p_n + 1$ and check if the difference $q_n - (p_1p_2\cdots p_n)$ is a prime. We will do this for the first five values of $n$.

For $n=1$, $P_1 = p_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$. The smallest prime greater than 3 is 5. The difference $q_1 - P_1 = 5 - 3 = 2$, which is a prime.

For $n=2$, $P_2 = p_1p_2 + 1 = 2\cdot3 + 1 = 7$. The smallest prime greater than 7 is 11. The difference $q_2 - P_2 = 11 - 7 = 4$, which is not a prime.

For $n=3$, $P_3 = p_1p_2p_3 + 1 = 2\cdot3\cdot5 + 1 = 31$. The smallest prime greater than 31 is 37. The difference $q_3 - P_3 = 37 - 31 = 6$, which is not a prime.

For $n=4$, $P_4 = p_1p_2p_3p_4 + 1 = 2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7 + 1 = 211$. The smallest prime greater than 211 is 217. The difference $q_4 - P_4 = 217 - 211 = 6$, which is not a prime.

For $n=5$, $P_5 = p_1p_2p_3p_4p_5 + 1 = 2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot11 + 1 = 2311$. The smallest prime greater than 2311 is 2317. The difference $q_5 - P_5 = 2317 - 2311 = 6$, which is not a prime.

For $n=1$, $n=2$, and $n=3$, the conjecture holds. However, for $n=4$ and $n=5$, the difference is not a prime. Therefore, the conjecture is not always true.
