 Since $p$ and $q$ are both primes, we know that they are both odd (the only even prime is 2). Therefore, $p^2$ and $q^2$ are both odd.

We can use the difference of squares factorization, which states that for any two numbers $a$ and $b$, $a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$.

Applying this to $p^2 - q^2$, we get $(p+q)(p-q)$.

Since $p \geq q \geq 5$, we know that $p+q$ and $p-q$ are both even (the difference or sum of two odd numbers is even).

Therefore, $p^2 - q^2$ is the product of two even numbers, which means it is divisible by 2 and 4.

However, we need to show that it is divisible by 24. To do this, we need to show that it is also divisible by 3.

Since $p$ and $q$ are both primes, they are not divisible by 3. Therefore, $p+q$ and $p-q$ are not divisible by 3.

However, we know that the product of two numbers is divisible by 3 if and only if at least one of the numbers is divisible by 3. Since $p+q$ and $p-q$ are not divisible by 3, we can conclude that 3 divides $(p+q)(p-q)$.

Therefore, $p^2 - q^2$ is divisible by 2, 4, and 3, which means it is divisible by 24.

Hence, we have proven that $24 | p^2 - q^2$.
