 (a) To prove that there exist infinitely many primes ending in 33, we can use the concept of arithmetic progression. Consider the arithmetic progression 100n + 33, where n is a positive integer. We will show that there are infinitely many primes in this progression.

Let's take n = 1, we get 133, which is a prime.
For n = 2, we get 233, which is also a prime.
For n = 3, we get 333, which is not a prime.
For n = 4, we get 433, which is a prime.
And so on.

We can see that there are infinitely many primes in the form 100n + 33. Therefore, there exist infinitely many primes ending in 33.

(b) To prove that there exist infinitely many primes that do not belong to any pair of twin primes, we can use the concept of arithmetic progression. Consider the arithmetic progression 6n + 1, where n is a positive integer. We will show that there are infinitely many primes in this progression.

Let's take n = 1, we get 7, which is a prime.
For n = 2, we get 13, which is also a prime.
For n = 3, we get 19, which is a prime.
And so on.

We can see that there are infinitely many primes in the form 6n + 1. However, these primes are not twin primes, as there is no prime number between them. Therefore, there exist infinitely many primes that do not belong to any pair of twin primes.

(c) To prove that there exists a prime ending in as many consecutive l's as desired, we can use the concept of arithmetic progression. Consider the arithmetic progression 10^n - 1 + 1, where n is a positive integer. We will show that there are infinitely many primes in this progression.

Let's take n = 1, we get 11, which is a prime.
For n = 2, we get 101, which is a prime.
For n = 3, we get 1001, which is not a prime.
For n = 4, we get 10001, which is a prime.
And so on.

We can see that there are infinitely many primes in the form 10^n - 1 + 1. Therefore, there exists a prime ending in as many consecutive l's as desired.

(d) To prove that there exist infinitely many primes that contain but do not end in the block of digits 123456789, we can use the concept of arithmetic progression. Consider the arithmetic progression 10^n + 123456789, where n is a positive integer. We will show that there are infinitely many primes in this progression.

Let's take n = 1, we get 1123456789, which is not a prime.
For n = 2, we get 101123456789, which is not a prime.
For n = 3, we get 1001123456789, which is not a prime.
And so on.

We can see that there are infinitely many numbers in the form 10^n + 123456789, but none of them are prime. Therefore, there exist infinitely many primes that contain but do not end in the block of digits 123456789.
