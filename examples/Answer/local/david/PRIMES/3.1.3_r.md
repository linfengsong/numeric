 (a) Let $p = 3n + 1$ be a prime number. We want to show that $p$ is also of the form $6m + 1$.

Since $p$ is of the form $3n + 1$, we can write $p = 3n + 1$. Now, we want to show that $p$ can be written in the form $6m + 1$.

We can rewrite $p$ as $p = 3n + 1 = 3(n - 1) + 4$. Since $3(n - 1)$ is a multiple of $3$, we can write $p = 3(n - 1) + 4 = 3m + 4$, where $m = n - 1$.

Now, we want to show that $p$ can be written in the form $6m + 1$. We can rewrite $p$ as $p = 3m + 4 = 3(2m + 1) + 1$. Since $3(2m + 1)$ is a multiple of $3$, we can write $p = 3(2m + 1) + 1 = 6m + 1$.

Therefore, any prime of the form $3n + 1$ is also of the form $6m + 1$.

(b) Let $n = 3k + 2$ be an integer. We want to show that $n$ has a prime factor of the form $3m + 2$.

Since $n = 3k + 2$, we can write $n = 3k + 2 = 3(k) + 2$. Now, we want to show that $n$ can be written in the form $3m + 2$.

We can rewrite $n$ as $n = 3(k) + 2 = 3(k) + 2$. Since $3(k)$ is a multiple of $3$, we can write $n = 3(k) + 2 = 3m + 2$, where $m = k$.

Now, we want to show that $n$ has a prime factor of the form $3m + 2$. Since $n = 3m + 2$, we can see that $n$ is of the form $3m + 2$. Therefore, $n$ has a prime factor of the form $3m + 2$.

(c) Let $p = n^3 - 1$ be a prime number. We want to show that the only prime of this form is $7$.

We can factor $n^3 - 1$ as $(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)$. Since $p$ is prime, either $n - 1 = 1$ or $n^2 + n + 1 = 1$.

If $n - 1 = 1$, then $n = 2$. Substituting $n = 2$ into $p = n^3 - 1$, we get $p = 2^3 - 1 = 7$.

If $n^2 + n + 1 = 1$, then $n^2 + n = 0$. This quadratic equation has no integer solutions, so $n = 2$ is the only solution.

Therefore, the only prime of the form $n^3 - 1$ is $7$.

(d) Let $p = 3n + 1$ be a prime number such that $3p + 1$ is a perfect square. We want to show that the only prime of this form is $5$.

Since $3p + 1$ is a perfect square, we can write $3p + 1 = k^2$ for some integer $k$. Substituting $p = 3n + 1$, we get $3(3n + 1) + 1 = k^2$. Simplifying, we get $9n + 4 = k^2$.

Since $9n + 4$ is a perfect square, $n$ must be of the form $n = 3m + 2$ for some integer $m$. Substituting $n = 3m + 2$, we get $9(3m + 2) + 4 = k^2$. Simplifying, we get $27m + 22 = k^2$.

Since $27m + 22$ is a perfect square, $m$ must be of the form $m = 2$. Substituting $m = 2$, we get $27(2) + 22 = k^2$. Simplifying, we get $76 = k^2$.

Therefore, $k = 2 \cdot 19 = 2^2 \cdot 19^2$. Since $k$ is a perfect square, $p = 3n + 1 = 3(3m + 2) + 1 = 3(2) + 1 = 7$ is the only prime of this form.

(e) Let $p = n^2 - 4$ be a prime number. We want to show that the only prime of this form is $5$.

We can factor $n^2 - 4$ as $(n - 2)(n + 2)$. Since $p$ is prime, either $n - 2 = 1$ or $n + 2 = 1$.

If $n - 2 = 1$, then $n = 3$. Substituting $n = 3$ into $p = n^2 - 4$, we get $p = 3^2 - 4 = 5$.

If $n + 2 = 1$, then $n = -1$. Substituting $n = -1$ into $p = n^2 - 4$, we get $p = (-1)^2 - 4 = -3$, which is not a prime number.

Therefore, the only prime of the form $n^2 - 4$ is $5$.
