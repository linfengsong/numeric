 To solve this problem, we need to find all twin prime pairs (p, q) such that pq - 2 is also a prime number.

First, let's recall the definition of twin primes. Twin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 2. In other words, if p and q are twin primes, then q = p + 2.

Now, let's consider the expression pq - 2. Since p and q are twin primes, we can substitute q = p + 2 into the expression to get p(p + 2) - 2.

Expanding this expression, we get p^2 + 2p - 2.

We want to find all twin prime pairs (p, q) such that p^2 + 2p - 2 is also a prime number.

Let's start by finding some twin prime pairs and checking if p^2 + 2p - 2 is prime:

1. (3, 5): 3^2 + 2*3 - 2 = 9 + 6 - 2 = 13, which is prime.
2. (5, 7): 5^2 + 2*5 - 2 = 25 + 10 - 2 = 33, which is not prime.
3. (11, 13): 11^2 + 2*11 - 2 = 121 + 22 - 2 = 141, which is not prime.
4. (17, 19): 17^2 + 2*17 - 2 = 289 + 34 - 2 = 319, which is not prime.

From these examples, we can see that not all twin prime pairs satisfy the condition that p^2 + 2p - 2 is prime. Therefore, there are no twin prime pairs p and q = p + 2 for which pq - 2 is also prime.
