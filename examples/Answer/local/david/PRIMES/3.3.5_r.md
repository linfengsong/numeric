 To show that the integer 5777 refutes the conjecture, we need to find a prime number p and a non-negative integer a such that $p + 2a^2 = 5777$.

Let's start by trying to express 5777 in the form $p + 2a^2$. We can start by setting $p = 1$ and then try to find a value of $a$ that satisfies the equation.

So, we have $1 + 2a^2 = 5777$. Rearranging the equation, we get $2a^2 = 5776$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $a^2 = 2888$.

Now, we need to find a non-negative integer $a$ that satisfies this equation. However, 2888 is not a perfect square, so there is no non-negative integer $a$ that can satisfy the equation.

Next, let's try setting $p = 3$. We have $3 + 2a^2 = 5777$. Rearranging the equation, we get $2a^2 = 5774$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $a^2 = 2887$.

Again, 2887 is not a perfect square, so there is no non-negative integer $a$ that can satisfy the equation.

We can continue this process for all prime numbers up to 5777, but we will not find a solution. This is because 5777 is an odd number and it is not of the form $p + 2a^2$ for any prime number p and non-negative integer a.

Therefore, the integer 5777 refutes the conjecture that every odd integer can be written in the form $p + 2a^2$, where p is either a prime or 1 and $a \geq{0}$.
