 (a) If n | m, then $R_n | R_m$.

Proof: If n | m, then there exists an integer k such that m = nk. Then, we have:

$R_m = 111...1$ (m digits)

$R_n = 111...1$ (n digits)

$R_m = 111...1$ (nk digits)

Since m = nk, we can rewrite $R_m$ as:

$R_m = 111...1$ (nk digits)

Now, we can see that $R_m$ is a concatenation of k copies of $R_n$. Therefore, $R_n$ divides $R_m$.

(b) If $d | R_n$ and $d | R_m$, then $d | R_{n+m}$.

Proof: Let $d | R_n$ and $d | R_m$. Then, by the definition of divisibility, there exist integers x and y such that:

$R_n = dx$ and $R_m = dy$

Now, we want to show that $d | R_{n+m}$. To do this, we can use the property of repunits that $R_{n+m} = R_nR_m + 1$. Substituting the expressions for $R_n$ and $R_m$, we get:

$R_{n+m} = dxdy + 1$

Since d divides both dx and dy, it also divides their product. Therefore, d divides $R_{n+m}$.

(c) If gcd(n, m) = 1, then $gcd(R_n, R_m)= 1$.

Proof: If gcd(n, m) = 1, then n and m are coprime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. We want to show that gcd(R_n, R_m) = 1.

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that gcd(R_n, R_m) > 1. Then, there exists a prime number p that divides both R_n and R_m. Since p divides R_n, it must divide $R_{kn}$ for any positive integer k. Similarly, since p divides R_m, it must divide $R_{km}$ for any positive integer k.

Now, since gcd(n, m) = 1, there exist integers x and y such that:

$nx + my = 1$

Multiplying both sides by p, we get:

$pnx + pmy = p$

Since p divides both $R_{kn}$ and $R_{km}$, it must divide their sum, which is equal to p. This is a contradiction, as we assumed that p divides both R_n and R_m, but their sum does not.

Therefore, our assumption that gcd(R_n, R_m) > 1 must be false, and we conclude that gcd(R_n, R_m) = 1.
