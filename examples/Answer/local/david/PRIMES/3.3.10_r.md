 To prove that the sequence produces n consecutive composite integers, we need to show that for any given n, the sequence contains n consecutive integers that are all composite.

Let's consider the sequence:
$$(n + 1)! - 2, (n + 1)! - 3, ..., (n + 1)! - (n + 1)$$

We can rewrite this sequence as:
$$(n + 1)! - 2, (n + 1)! - 3, ..., (n + 1)! - (n + 1)$$

Now, let's consider the first term of the sequence, which is $(n + 1)! - 2$. We can factor out $(n + 1)$ from this term:
$$(n + 1)! - 2 = (n + 1)((n + 1) - 1) - 2 = (n + 1)n - 2$$

Since $(n + 1)$ and $n$ are consecutive integers, one of them must be even. Therefore, $(n + 1)n$ is even, and $(n + 1)n - 2$ is even as well. An even number minus 2 is still even, so $(n + 1)! - 2$ is even and divisible by 2.

Now, let's consider the second term of the sequence, which is $(n + 1)! - 3$. We can factor out $(n + 1)$ from this term:
$$(n + 1)! - 3 = (n + 1)((n + 1) - 1) - 3 = (n + 1)n - 3$$

Since $(n + 1)$ and $n$ are consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 3. Therefore, $(n + 1)n$ is divisible by 3, and $(n + 1)n - 3$ is divisible by 3 as well.

We can continue this process for all terms in the sequence. For each term, we can factor out $(n + 1)$ and show that the term is divisible by the corresponding number in the sequence. Since each term in the sequence is divisible by a different number, this means that each term is composite.

Therefore, the sequence $(n + 1)! - 2, (n + 1)! - 3, ..., (n + 1)! - (n + 1)$ produces n consecutive composite integers for n - 2.
