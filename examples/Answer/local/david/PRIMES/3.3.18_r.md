 (a) Since gcd(p, b) = 1, there exist integers r and s such that pr + bs = 1.
Let n_k = kp - as for k = 1, 2, ....
We want to show that p | (a + n_k b) for k = 1, 2, ....
We have
a + n_k b = a + (kp - as)b = a + kpb - asb = a + kpb - (pr + bs)a
= a + kpb - pra - bsa = (a - ra) + kpb - bsa.
Since p | (a - ra) and p | (kpb - bsa), we have p | (a + n_k b).
Therefore, every pth term in the progression is divisible by p.

(b) If b is an odd integer, then every other term in the progression is even.
This is because every other term can be written as a + n_k b, where k is an odd integer.
Since p | (a + n_k b) and p = 2, we have 2 | (a + n_k b).
Therefore, every other term in the progression is even.
The answer is $\boxed{2}$.
