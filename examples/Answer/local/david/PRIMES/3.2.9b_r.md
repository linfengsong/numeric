 To show that every prime divisor of n! + 1 is an odd integer greater than n, we will use proof by contradiction.

Assume that there exists a prime divisor p of n! + 1 such that p is not an odd integer or p is less than or equal to n.

Case 1: p is not an odd integer.
If p is not an odd integer, then p must be even. However, the only even prime number is 2, and 2 is less than or equal to n. This contradicts our assumption that p is not less than or equal to n.

Case 2: p is less than or equal to n.
If p is less than or equal to n, then p must divide n!. However, n! + 1 is not divisible by p, because when we divide n! by p, we get a remainder of 1. This contradicts our assumption that p is a prime divisor of n! + 1.

Therefore, our assumption that there exists a prime divisor of n! + 1 that is not an odd integer greater than n must be false. Hence, every prime divisor of n! + 1 is an odd integer greater than n.
