 To find the prime factorization of an integer, we need to express the integer as a product of prime numbers. 

Let's start with 1234. 

We can start by dividing 1234 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 1234 is an even number, it is divisible by 2. 

1234 ÷ 2 = 617

Now, 617 is a prime number itself. So, the prime factorization of 1234 is 2 × 617.

Next, let's find the prime factorization of 10140.

We can start by dividing 10140 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. 

10140 ÷ 2 = 5070

We can divide 5070 by 2 again to get:

5070 ÷ 2 = 2535

Now, 2535 is not divisible by 2. So, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3. 

2535 ÷ 3 = 845

Now, 845 is not divisible by 3. So, we move on to the next prime number, which is 5. 

845 ÷ 5 = 169

Now, 169 is not divisible by 5. So, we move on to the next prime number, which is 7. 

169 ÷ 7 = 24.142857142857143

Since 169 is not divisible by 7, we move on to the next prime number, which is 11. 

169 ÷ 11 = 15.363636363636363

Since 169 is not divisible by 11, we move on to the next prime number, which is 13. 

169 ÷ 13 = 13

Now, 13 is a prime number itself. So, the prime factorization of 10140 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 13 × 13.

Finally, let's find the prime factorization of 36000.

We can start by dividing 36000 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. 

36000 ÷ 2 = 18000

We can divide 18000 by 2 again to get:

18000 ÷ 2 = 9000

We can divide 9000 by 2 again to get:

9000 ÷ 2 = 4500

We can divide 4500 by 2 again to get:

4500 ÷ 2 = 2250

We can divide 2250 by 2 again to get:

2250 ÷ 2 = 1125

Now, 1125 is not divisible by 2. So, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3. 

1125 ÷ 3 = 375

We can divide 375 by 3 again to get:

375 ÷ 3 = 125

Now, 125 is not divisible by 3. So, we move on to the next prime number, which is 5. 

125 ÷ 5 = 25

We can divide 25 by 5 again to get:

25 ÷ 5 = 5

Now, 5 is a prime number itself. So, the prime factorization of 36000 is 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5.

So, the prime factorizations of the integers 1234, 10140, and 36000 are:

1234 = 2 × 617
10140 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 13 × 13
36000 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5
