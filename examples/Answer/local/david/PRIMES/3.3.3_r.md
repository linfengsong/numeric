 To find all pairs of primes p and q satisfying p - q = 3, we can start by listing the first few prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, and so on.

Now, we can pair up these primes by subtracting 3 from each prime and checking if the result is also a prime number. For example, if we start with the prime number 5, we get 5 - 3 = 2, which is also a prime number. So, the pair (5, 2) satisfies the condition p - q = 3.

We can continue this process for all the prime numbers listed above. Here are the pairs of primes that satisfy p - q = 3:

(5, 2)
(7, 4)
(11, 8)
(13, 10)
(17, 14)
(19, 16)
(23, 20)
(29, 26)
(31, 28)
(41, 38)
(43, 40)
(53, 50)
(59, 56)
(61, 58)
(71, 68)
(73, 70)
(83, 80)
(89, 86)
(97, 94)

And so on. These are all the pairs of primes p and q satisfying p - q = 3.
