 We can use the difference of squares factorization $n^2 - 2 = (n - \sqrt{2})(n + \sqrt{2})$.

For $n = 3$, we get $3^2 - 2 = 7$.

For $n = 5$, we get $5^2 - 2 = 23$.

For $n = 7$, we get $7^2 - 2 = 47$.

For $n = 9$, we get $9^2 - 2 = 79$.

For $n = 11$, we get $11^2 - 2 = 121 - 2 = 119 = 7 \cdot 17$.

Therefore, the only prime of the form $n^2 - 2$ in the list is $7$.

However, we can still find some other primes of this form by considering other values of $n$.

For $n = 13$, we get $13^2 - 2 = 169 - 2 = 167$.

For $n = 17$, we get $17^2 - 2 = 289 - 2 = 287 = 7 \cdot 41$.

For $n = 19$, we get $19^2 - 2 = 361 - 2 = 359$.

For $n = 23$, we get $23^2 - 2 = 529 - 2 = 527 = 17 \cdot 31$.

For $n = 29$, we get $29^2 - 2 = 841 - 2 = 839$.

So, the five primes of the form $n^2 - 2$ are $7$, $47$, $79$, $167$, and $839$.
