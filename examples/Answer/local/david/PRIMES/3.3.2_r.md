 (a) Let's consider two twin prime numbers, p and q. Since they are twin primes, they differ by 2, i.e., q = p + 2. The product of these two primes is pq. If 1 is added to this product, we get pq + 1.

Now, let's consider the expression (p + 1)(q + 1). By the distributive property of multiplication, we can expand this to get pq + p + q + 1. Since q = p + 2, we can substitute this into the expression to get pq + p + (p + 2) + 1. Simplifying this gives 2pq + 3p + 3.

Now, let's consider the expression (pq + 1) + (p + q). By the commutative property of addition, we can rearrange this to get (pq + p + q + 1). Since q = p + 2, we can substitute this into the expression to get (pq + p + (p + 2) + 1). Simplifying this gives 2pq + 3p + 3.

We can see that the expressions (p + 1)(q + 1) and (pq + 1) + (p + q) are equal. Therefore, we have shown that the sum of a product of twin primes and 1 is equal to the sum of the twin primes plus 1, which is a perfect square.

(b) Let's consider the sum of twin primes p and p + 2. This sum is p + (p + 2) = 2p + 2. Since p is a prime number greater than 3, it must be odd. Therefore, 2p is even, and 2p + 2 is even.

Now, let's consider the divisibility by 12. Since 12 = 3 * 4, we need to show that the sum is divisible by both 3 and 4.

For divisibility by 3, we can use the property that the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3 if the number itself is divisible by 3. In this case, the sum of the digits of 2p + 2 is 2 + p + (p + 2) = 2p + 4. Since 2p is even, 2p + 4 is also even. Therefore, the sum of the digits is even, and the sum itself is divisible by 3.

For divisibility by 4, we can use the property that a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. In this case, the last two digits of 2p + 2 are 2 and 2, which form the number 22. Since 22 is divisible by 4, the sum itself is divisible by 4.

Since the sum of twin primes p and p + 2 is divisible by both 3 and 4, it is divisible by 12.
