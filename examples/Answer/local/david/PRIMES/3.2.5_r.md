 To show that any composite three-digit number must have a prime factor less than or equal to 31, we can use the concept of prime factorization.

A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. In other words, a composite number is any positive integer greater than one that is not a prime number.

A three-digit number is a number that has exactly three digits, i.e., it is a number between 100 and 999.

Now, let's consider the smallest and largest three-digit numbers, which are 100 and 999, respectively.

The smallest three-digit number, 100, has prime factors 2 and 5. The largest three-digit number, 999, can be factored into prime factors as 3^3 * 37.

We can see that the smallest three-digit number has a prime factor 2, and the largest three-digit number has a prime factor 37. 

Since 37 is less than or equal to 31, we can conclude that any composite three-digit number must have a prime factor less than or equal to 31.
