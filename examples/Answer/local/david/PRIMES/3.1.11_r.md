 (a) The first few prime numbers that are 1 less than a power of 2 are:

$3 = 2^2 - 1$

$7 = 2^3 - 1$

$31 = 2^5 - 1$

$127 = 2^7 - 1$

$8191 = 2^{13} - 1$

So, four more of these primes are:

$131071 = 2^{17} - 1$

$524287 = 2^{19} - 1$

$2147483647 = 2^{31} - 1$

$2305843009213693951 = 2^{61} - 1$

(b) To show that $k$ is an odd integer, except when $k = 2$, we can use the fact that $p = 2^k - 1$ is prime.

If $k$ were even, say $k = 2m$ for some integer $m$, then $2^k - 1 = 2^{2m} - 1 = (2^m)^2 - 1$. This is a difference of squares, so it can be factored as $(2^m - 1)(2^m + 1)$. Since $2^m - 1$ and $2^m + 1$ are both greater than 1, this would mean that $2^k - 1$ is not prime.

However, if $k = 2$, then $2^k - 1 = 3$, which is prime. Therefore, $k$ must be an odd integer, except when $k = 2$.
