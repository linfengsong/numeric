 To find the smallest positive integer n for which the function $f(n) = n^2 + n + 17$ is composite, we need to find the smallest n such that $f(n)$ is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself.

Let's start by testing some values of n:

For n = 1, $f(1) = 1^2 + 1 + 17 = 19$, which is a prime number.

For n = 2, $f(2) = 2^2 + 2 + 17 = 23$, which is also a prime number.

For n = 3, $f(3) = 3^2 + 3 + 17 = 29$, which is also a prime number.

For n = 4, $f(4) = 4^2 + 4 + 17 = 37$, which is a prime number.

For n = 5, $f(5) = 5^2 + 5 + 17 = 47$, which is a prime number.

For n = 6, $f(6) = 6^2 + 6 + 17 = 61$, which is a prime number.

For n = 7, $f(7) = 7^2 + 7 + 17 = 79$, which is a prime number.

For n = 8, $f(8) = 8^2 + 8 + 17 = 97$, which is a prime number.

For n = 9, $f(9) = 9^2 + 9 + 17 = 127$, which is a prime number.

For n = 10, $f(10) = 10^2 + 10 + 17 = 167$, which is a prime number.

For n = 11, $f(11) = 11^2 + 11 + 17 = 221$, which is divisible by 13 and 17, so it is composite.

Therefore, the smallest positive integer n for which the function $f(n) = n^2 + n + 17$ is composite is n = 11.

Now let's do the same for the functions $g(n) = n^2 + 21n + 1$ and $h(n) = 3n^2 + 3n + 23$.

For $g(n) = n^2 + 21n + 1$, we can rewrite it as $g(n) = (n + 11)^2 - 120$.

For n = 1, $g(1) = (1 + 11)^2 - 120 = 121 - 120 = 1$, which is a prime number.

For n = 2, $g(2) = (2 + 11)^2 - 120 = 169 - 120 = 49$, which is divisible by 7, so it is composite.

Therefore, the smallest positive integer n for which the function $g(n) = n^2 + 21n + 1$ is composite is n = 2.

For $h(n) = 3n^2 + 3n + 23$, we can rewrite it as $h(n) = 3(n + 1)^2 + 20$.

For n = 1, $h(1) = 3(1 + 1)^2 + 20 = 3(4) + 20 = 32$, which is divisible by 2, so it is composite.

Therefore, the smallest positive integer n for which the function $h(n) = 3n^2 + 3n + 23$ is composite is n = 1.

In conclusion, the smallest positive integer n for which the function $f(n) = n^2 + n + 17$ is composite is n = 11, the function $g(n) = n^2 + 21n + 1$ is composite is n = 2, and the function $h(n) = 3n^2 + 3n + 23$ is composite is n = 1.
