 To find all the prime numbers between 100 and 200 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, follow these steps:

1. Create a list of all the integers from 100 to 200.
2. Start with the first number in the list, which is 100. Since 100 is not a prime number, cross it out.
3. Move to the next uncrossed number, which is 101. This is a prime number, so circle it.
4. Now, cross out all the multiples of 101 from the list.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with the next uncrossed number, which is 103. This is a prime number, so circle it. Cross out all its multiples from the list.
6. Continue this process until you reach the end of the list.

Here's the list of prime numbers between 100 and 200:

101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199

So, the prime numbers between 100 and 200 are:

101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199
