 (a) We can write $n^4 + 4$ as $(n^2 + 2)^2 - 4n^2 = (n^2 + 2 - 2n)(n^2 + 2 + 2n)$.
Since $n > 1$, both factors are greater than 1, so $n^4 + 4$ is composite.

(b) If n is composite, then n has a prime factor p such that 2 < p < n.
Since n > 4, we can choose p such that 2 < p < n - 1.
Then p divides (n - 1)!, so n divides (n - 1)!.

(c) We can write $8^n + 1$ as $(2^n + 1)(2^{2n} - 2^n + 1)$.
Since $2^n + 1 | 2^{3n} + 1$, we have $2^n + 1 | 2^{2n} - 2^n + 1$.
Therefore, $2^n + 1 | 8^n + 1$, so $8^n + 1$ is composite.

(d) If n is even, say n = 2k, then n - 6 = 2(k - 3), and both k and k - 3 are composite.
If n is odd, say n = 2k + 1, then n - 9 = 2(k - 4) + 1, and both k - 4 and k - 4 + 1 are composite.
In either case, n can be written as the sum of two composite numbers.

Therefore, all of the statements are established.
