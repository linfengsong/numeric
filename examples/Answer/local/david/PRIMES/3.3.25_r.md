 To prove this inequality, we will use the fact that for any positive integer $k$, the $k$th prime number $p_k$ is greater than $k$. This is a well-known result in number theory, and it can be proven by contradiction.

Now, let's consider the inequality given in the problem:

$$p_n < p_l + p_2 + \ldots + p_{n-l}$$

Since $p_k > k$ for any positive integer $k$, we can replace each $p_k$ in the inequality with $k$:

$$n < l + 2 + \ldots + (n-l)$$

This simplifies to:

$$n < n - l + l + 2 + \ldots + (n-l)$$

$$n < n + 2 + \ldots + (n-l)$$

Since $l < n$, we can subtract $n$ from both sides of the inequality:

$$0 < 2 + \ldots + (n-l)$$

This inequality is true, as the sum of positive integers is always positive. Therefore, the original inequality $p_n < p_l + p_2 + \ldots + p_{n-l}$ is also true for $n > 3$.
