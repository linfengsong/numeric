 To verify that 1949 and 1951 are twin primes, we need to check if they are both prime numbers and if they differ by 2.

First, let's check if they are prime numbers. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

1949: The factors of 1949 are 1, 1949. Since 1949 has only two distinct positive divisors, it is a prime number.

1951: The factors of 1951 are 1, 1951. Since 1951 has only two distinct positive divisors, it is a prime number.

Now, let's check if they differ by 2. 

1951 - 1949 = 2

Since 1949 and 1951 differ by 2, they are twin primes.

Therefore, the integers 1949 and 1951 are twin primes.
