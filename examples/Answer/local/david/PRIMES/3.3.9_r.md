 (a) To show that the integers n, n + 2, n + 4 cannot all be prime, we can use a proof by contradiction.

Assume that n, n + 2, and n + 4 are all prime.

Since n is prime, n must be odd (as 2 is the only even prime number).

Then, n + 2 is also odd (as the sum of an odd number and an even number is odd).

And, n + 4 is even (as the sum of an odd number and an even number is even).

However, we know that all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd. Therefore, n + 4 cannot be prime, as it is even.

This contradicts our initial assumption that n, n + 2, and n + 4 are all prime.

Therefore, the integers n, n + 2, n + 4 cannot all be prime.

(b) To find five sets of prime-triplets, we can simply list out the prime numbers and find the combinations that are 2 apart and then 4 apart.

Here are five sets of prime-triplets:

1. (5, 7, 11)
2. (11, 13, 17)
3. (17, 19, 23)
4. (29, 31, 37)
5. (41, 43, 47)

These are just five examples, and there are many more prime-triplets that can be found by continuing this process.
