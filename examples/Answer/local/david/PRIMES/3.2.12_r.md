 (a) We will prove this by induction. For $n=5$, we have $P_5=11$ and $2^5-1=31$. Since $11<31$, the statement holds for $n=5$.

Assume that $P_k > 2^k - 1$ for some $k \geq 5$. We will show that $P_{k+1} > 2^{k+1} - 1$.

Since $P_k$ is a prime number, it is odd. Therefore, $P_k$ is not divisible by 2. By the induction hypothesis, we have $P_k > 2^k - 1$. Thus, $P_k$ is greater than the first $k$ odd numbers, which are $1, 3, 5, \ldots, 2^k - 1$.

Now, consider the number $P_{k+1} = P_k + 2^k$. Since $P_k$ is greater than the first $k$ odd numbers, it is also greater than the $(k+1)$th odd number, which is $2^{k+1} - 1$. Therefore, we have $P_{k+1} > 2^{k+1} - 1 + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1$.

By induction, the statement $P_n > 2^n - 1$ holds for all $n \geq 5$.

(b) We will prove this by contradiction. Suppose that there exists an integer $n$ such that $P_n = p_1p_2\ldots p_n + 1$ is a perfect square.

Since $P_n$ is a prime number, it is odd. Therefore, $P_n$ is not divisible by 2. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, $P_n$ can be written as a product of prime numbers. However, since $P_n$ is not divisible by 2, it cannot be written as a product of an even number of prime numbers. Thus, $P_n$ must be a product of an odd number of prime numbers.

Now, let $P_n = p_1p_2\ldots p_n = q^2$ for some prime number $q$. Since $P_n$ is a product of an odd number of prime numbers, $q$ must be one of the prime numbers in the product. However, if we remove $q$ from the product, we get a number that is not divisible by $q$. This contradicts the fact that $P_n$ is a prime number.

Therefore, our assumption that $P_n = p_1p_2\ldots p_n + 1$ is a perfect square is false. Hence, none of the integers $P_n = p_1p_2\ldots p_n + 1$ is a perfect square.

(c) We will prove this by contradiction. Suppose that the sum
$$\frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{p_n}$$
is an integer.

Let $P_n = p_1p_2\ldots p_n$. Then, we have
$$\frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{p_n} = \frac{P_n}{p_1p_2\ldots p_n}.$$

Since $P_n$ is a product of prime numbers, it is also a prime number. Therefore, $P_n$ is not divisible by any of the prime numbers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$. This means that the sum
$$\frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{p_n}$$
cannot be an integer.

However, we have reached a contradiction. Therefore, the sum
$$\frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{p_n}$$
cannot be an integer.
