 (a) Since $p$ is a prime and $p | a^n$, by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, $p$ must be a factor of $a^n$. Let $a = p^k \cdot m$, where $m$ is a positive integer not divisible by $p$. Then $a^n = (p^k \cdot m)^n = p^{kn} \cdot m^n$. Since $p$ is a factor of $a^n$, $p$ must be a factor of $p^{kn} \cdot m^n$. Therefore, $p$ must be a factor of $p^{kn}$, which implies that $p^{n-1}$ is a factor of $p^{kn}$. Thus, $p^n | a^n$.

(b) Since gcd(a, b) = p, a prime, we know that both a and b are divisible by p. 

For $gcd(a^2, b^2)$, since both a and b are divisible by p, $a^2$ and $b^2$ are both divisible by $p^2$. Therefore, $gcd(a^2, b^2) = p^2$.

For $gcd(a^2, b)$, since $a^2$ is divisible by $p^2$ and b is divisible by p, $gcd(a^2, b)$ is at most p. However, since $a^2$ and b share a common factor of p, $gcd(a^2, b)$ must be at least p. Therefore, $gcd(a^2, b) = p$.

For $gcd(a^3, b^2)$, since $a^3$ is divisible by $p^3$ and $b^2$ is divisible by $p^2$, $gcd(a^3, b^2)$ is at most $p^2$. However, since $a^3$ and $b^2$ share a common factor of $p^2$, $gcd(a^3, b^2)$ must be at least $p^2$. Therefore, $gcd(a^3, b^2) = p^2$.

In conclusion, $gcd(a^2, b^2) = p^2$, $gcd(a^2, b) = p$, and $gcd(a^3, b^2) = p^2$.
