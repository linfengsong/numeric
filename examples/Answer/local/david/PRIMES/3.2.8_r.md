 To prove the infinitude of primes using the given integer $N$, we will show that $N$ is not divisible by any of the prime numbers $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$, which contradicts the assumption that there are only finitely many primes.

Let's consider the prime factorization of $N$. Since $N$ is a sum of products of the prime numbers $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$, each term in the sum shares a common factor with $N$. However, when we add these terms together, we are essentially adding multiples of these common factors, which means that $N$ itself is also a multiple of these common factors.

Now, let's examine the divisibility of $N$ by each of the prime numbers $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$. We can see that $N$ is not divisible by $p_1$ because it is a term in the sum that does not include $p_1$. Similarly, $N$ is not divisible by $p_2$ because it is a term in the sum that does not include $p_2$. We can continue this argument for all the prime numbers $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$.

This contradicts our initial assumption that there are only finitely many primes, because we have found an integer $N$ that is not divisible by any of the given prime numbers. Therefore, there must be infinitely many prime numbers.
