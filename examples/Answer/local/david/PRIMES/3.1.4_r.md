 To show that $p^2 + 2$ is composite, we need to show that it has factors other than 1 and itself.

We know that $p$ is a prime number, and since $p \geq 5$, $p$ must be an odd number. This is because all prime numbers except for 2 are odd.

Now, let's consider the expression $p^2 + 2$. Since $p$ is odd, $p^2$ is also odd (because the square of an odd number is always odd). 

Now, let's add 2 to an odd number. The result will be an odd number again (because the sum of an odd number and an even number is always odd).

So, $p^2 + 2$ is an odd number.

Now, let's try to factorize $p^2 + 2$. We can use the difference of squares factorization, which states that for any two numbers $a$ and $b$, the expression $a^2 - b^2$ can be factored into $(a+b)(a-b)$.

In our case, we can rewrite $p^2 + 2$ as $p^2 - (-2)$. So, we can use the difference of squares factorization to factorize $p^2 - (-2)$ as $(p + \sqrt{-2})(p - \sqrt{-2})$.

However, we know that $\sqrt{-2}$ is an imaginary number, which means that $p + \sqrt{-2}$ and $p - \sqrt{-2}$ are also imaginary numbers.

Since we are dealing with real numbers (the prime number $p$), we cannot consider imaginary numbers as factors of $p^2 + 2$.

Therefore, we need to find other factors of $p^2 + 2$.

We can try to divide $p^2 + 2$ by $p$. If we do this, we get:

$$\frac{p^2 + 2}{p} = \frac{p^2}{p} + \frac{2}{p} = p + \frac{2}{p}$$

Since $p$ is a prime number, it has no factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, $p + \frac{2}{p}$ is not an integer, which means that $p$ is not a factor of $p^2 + 2$.

So, we have found another factor of $p^2 + 2$, which is $p + \frac{2}{p}$.

Since $p^2 + 2$ has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.
