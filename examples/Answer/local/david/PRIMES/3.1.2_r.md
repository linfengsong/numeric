 The conjecture is not true because there are positive integers that cannot be written in the given form. For example, the number 2. If we try to write 2 in the form $p + a^2$, we would need $p$ to be a prime number and $a$ to be a non-negative integer. However, there is no prime number $p$ such that $p + a^2 = 2$ for any non-negative integer $a$. Therefore, the conjecture is not true.
