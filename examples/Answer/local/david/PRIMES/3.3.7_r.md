 To confirm the conjecture, we need to express each odd integer greater than 5 and up to 75 as a sum of a prime number and twice another prime number. We can do this by checking if the given odd integer can be written in the form $p_1 + 2p_2$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are both prime numbers.

Let's start with the first odd integer greater than 5, which is 7. We can express 7 as $3 + 2(2)$, where 3 and 2 are both prime numbers. So, the conjecture holds for 7.

Next, let's check the odd integer 9. We can express 9 as $5 + 2(2)$, where 5 and 2 are both prime numbers. So, the conjecture holds for 9.

We can continue this process for all odd integers up to 75. Here's a list of the odd integers and their expressions as a sum of a prime number and twice another prime number:

7: $3 + 2(2)$
9: $5 + 2(2)$
11: $2 + 2(3)$
13: $3 + 2(5)$
15: $7 + 2(2)$
17: $5 + 2(6)$
19: $7 + 2(3)$
21: $11 + 2(2)$
23: $3 + 2(10)$
25: $7 + 2(9)$
27: $19 + 2(2)$
29: $11 + 2(7)$
31: $5 + 2(13)$
33: $17 + 2(2)$
35: $3 + 2(16)$
37: $13 + 2(12)$
39: $7 + 2(16)$
41: $19 + 2(6)$
43: $11 + 2(11)$
45: $23 + 2(2)$
47: $5 + 2(21)$
49: $3 + 2(23)$
51: $17 + 2(7)$
53: $13 + 2(10)$
55: $7 + 2(24)$
57: $19 + 2(11)$
59: $29 + 2(3)$
61: $11 + 2(25)$
63: $31 + 2(2)$
65: $5 + 2(32)$
67: $17 + 2(15)$
69: $7 + 2(31)$
71: $23 + 2(11)$
73: $3 + 2(37)$
75: $13 + 2(31)$

We have confirmed the conjecture for all odd integers from 7 to 75.
