 To verify that if $a \equiv b$ (mod $n_1$) and $a \equiv b$ (mod $n_2$), then $a \equiv b$ (mod n), where the integer $n = lcm(n_1, n_2)$, we need to show that $a - b$ is divisible by both $n_1$ and $n_2$.

Since $a \equiv b$ (mod $n_1$), we have $n_1 | (a - b)$. Similarly, since $a \equiv b$ (mod $n_2$), we have $n_2 | (a - b)$.

Now, let's consider the least common multiple (LCM) of $n_1$ and $n_2$, denoted as $n = lcm(n_1, n_2)$. By definition, $n$ is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $n_1$ and $n_2$.

Since $n_1 | (a - b)$ and $n_2 | (a - b)$, and $n$ is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $n_1$ and $n_2$, it follows that $n | (a - b)$. Therefore, $a \equiv b$ (mod n).

Now, let's consider the case where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are relatively prime. If $n_1$ and $n_2$ are relatively prime, their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1, i.e., gcd($n_1$, $n_2$) = 1. Since $n = lcm(n_1, n_2)$, we have $n = n_1n_2 / gcd(n_1, n_2) = n_1n_2 / 1 = n_1n_2$.

Since $a \equiv b$ (mod $n_1$) and $a \equiv b$ (mod $n_2$), and $n = n_1n_2$, we have $a \equiv b$ (mod $n_1n_2$) by the previous result.

In conclusion, if $a \equiv b$ (mod $n_1$) and $a \equiv b$ (mod $n_2$), then $a \equiv b$ (mod n), where the integer $n = lcm(n_1, n_2)$. Hence, whenever $n_1$ and $n_2$ are relatively prime, $a \equiv b$ (mod $n_1n_2$).
