 We can start by listing out the first few factorials and their sums:

$1! = 1$

$1! + 2! = 1 + 2 = 3$

$1! + 2! + 3! = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9$

$1! + 2! + 3! + 4! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33$

$1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 + 120 = 153$

We can see that the sum of the first four factorials is not a perfect square, but the sum of the first five factorials is a perfect square. 

We can continue this process to find more values of $n$ for which the sum of the first $n$ factorials is a perfect square. 

After further calculations, we find that the next value of $n$ for which the sum of the first $n$ factorials is a perfect square is $n = 7$. 

Therefore, the values of $n$ for which $1! + 2! + 3! + \ldots + n!$ is a perfect square are $n = 1, 5, 7$.
