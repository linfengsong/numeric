 These curious calculations are based on the property of 9, which is that when you multiply a number by 9 and add the number itself, the result is a number consisting of the same digit repeated. This is because $9n + n = 10n - n + n = 10n$, and when you multiply a number by 10 and add the number itself, the result is a number consisting of the same digit repeated.

For example, in the first calculation, $1 · 9 + 2 = 11$, we are multiplying 1 by 9 and adding 2. The result is 11, which consists of the digit 1 repeated twice.

In the second calculation, $12 · 9 + 3 = 111$, we are multiplying 12 by 9 and adding 3. The result is 111, which consists of the digit 1 repeated three times.

This pattern continues for the remaining calculations. In the third calculation, $123 · 9 + 4 = 1111$, the result is 1111, which consists of the digit 1 repeated four times.

In the fourth calculation, $1234 · 9 + 5 = 11111$, the result is 11111, which consists of the digit 1 repeated five times.

This pattern continues up to the last calculation, $123456789 · 9 + 10 = 1111111111$, where the result is 1111111111, which consists of the digit 1 repeated ten times.

This property of 9 is a consequence of the fact that when you multiply a number by 10 and add the number itself, the result is a number consisting of the same digit repeated. This is because $10n - n = 9n$, and when you multiply a number by 9, the result is a number consisting of the same digit repeated.
