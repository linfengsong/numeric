 (a) $25x \equiv 15$ (mod 29).

We can simplify the congruence by dividing both sides by 5, which gives us $5x \equiv 3$ (mod 29).

Now, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 29. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find this inverse.

The extended Euclidean algorithm gives us $1 = 5(-5) + 29(1)$. Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 29 is -5, or equivalently, 24 (since -5 is equivalent to 24 modulo 29).

Multiplying both sides of the congruence $5x \equiv 3$ (mod 29) by 24, we get $x \equiv 72$ (mod 29). Simplifying 72 modulo 29, we find that $x \equiv 23$ (mod 29).

So, the solution to the congruence $25x \equiv 15$ (mod 29) is $x \equiv 23$ (mod 29).

(b) $5x \equiv 2$ (mod 26).

We can simplify the congruence by dividing both sides by 5, which gives us $x \equiv 2/5$ (mod 26).

Now, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 26. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find this inverse.

The extended Euclidean algorithm gives us $1 = 5(-1) + 26(1)$. Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 26 is -1, or equivalently, 25 (since -1 is equivalent to 25 modulo 26).

Multiplying both sides of the congruence $x \equiv 2/5$ (mod 26) by 25, we get $x \equiv 50$ (mod 26). Simplifying 50 modulo 26, we find that $x \equiv 24$ (mod 26).

So, the solution to the congruence $5x \equiv 2$ (mod 26) is $x \equiv 24$ (mod 26).

(c) $6x \equiv 15$ (mod 21).

We can simplify the congruence by dividing both sides by 3, which gives us $2x \equiv 5$ (mod 21).

Now, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 21. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find this inverse.

The extended Euclidean algorithm gives us $1 = 2(-10) + 21(1)$. Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 21 is -10, or equivalently, 11 (since -10 is equivalent to 11 modulo 21).

Multiplying both sides of the congruence $2x \equiv 5$ (mod 21) by 11, we get $x \equiv 55$ (mod 21). Simplifying 55 modulo 21, we find that $x \equiv 10$ (mod 21).

So, the solution to the congruence $6x \equiv 15$ (mod 21) is $x \equiv 10$ (mod 21).

(d) $36x \equiv 8$ (mod 102).

We can simplify the congruence by dividing both sides by 2, which gives us $18x \equiv 4$ (mod 102).

Now, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 18 modulo 102. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find this inverse.

The extended Euclidean algorithm gives us $1 = 18(-3) + 102(1)$. Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of 18 modulo 102 is -3, or equivalently, 99 (since -3 is equivalent to 99 modulo 102).

Multiplying both sides of the congruence $18x \equiv 4$ (mod 102) by 99, we get $x \equiv 396$ (mod 102). Simplifying 396 modulo 102, we find that $x \equiv 48$ (mod 102).

So, the solution to the congruence $36x \equiv 8$ (mod 102) is $x \equiv 48$ (mod 102).

(e) $34x \equiv 60$ (mod 98).

We can simplify the congruence by dividing both sides by 2, which gives us $17x \equiv 30$ (mod 98).

Now, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 17 modulo 98. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find this inverse.

The extended Euclidean algorithm gives us $1 = 17(-5) + 98(1)$. Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of 17 modulo 98 is -5, or equivalently, 93 (since -5 is equivalent to 93 modulo 98).

Multiplying both sides of the congruence $17x \equiv 30$ (mod 98) by 93, we get $x \equiv 2790$ (mod 98). Simplifying 2790 modulo 98, we find that $x \equiv 74$ (mod 98).

So, the solution to the congruence $34x \equiv 60$ (mod 98) is $x \equiv 74$ (mod 98).

(f) $140x \equiv 133$ (mod 301).

We can simplify the congruence by dividing both sides by 7, which gives us $20x \equiv 19$ (mod 301).

Now, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 20 modulo 301. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find this inverse.

The extended Euclidean algorithm gives us $1 = 20(-15) + 301(1)$. Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of 20 modulo 301 is -15, or equivalently, 286 (since -15 is equivalent to 286 modulo 301).

Multiplying both sides of the congruence $20x \equiv 19$ (mod 301) by 286, we get $x \equiv 5234$ (mod 301). Simplifying 5234 modulo 301, we find that $x \equiv 223$ (mod 301).

So, the solution to the congruence $140x \equiv 133$ (mod 301) is $x \equiv 223$ (mod 301).
