 Let $n$ be the number of eggs in the basket. We are given that $n\equiv 1\pmod{2}$, $n\equiv 2\pmod{3}$, $n\equiv 3\pmod{4}$, $n\equiv 4\pmod{5}$, and $n\equiv 5\pmod{6}$, and that $n\equiv 0\pmod{7}$.
From the first five congruences, we can write $n$ in the form $n = 60a + 15$. Substituting this into the last congruence, we have $60a + 15 \equiv 0\pmod{7}$, or $a\equiv 1\pmod{7}$. Thus, $a$ can be written in the form $a = 7b + 1$.
Substituting this back into the equation $n = 60a + 15$, we have $n = 60(7b + 1) + 15 = 420b + 60 + 15 = 420b + 75$.
The smallest possible value of $b$ is $0$, so the smallest possible value of $n$ is $420(0) + 75 = \boxed{75}$.
The answer is $\boxed{75}$.
