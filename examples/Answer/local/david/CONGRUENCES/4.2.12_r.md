 (a) To prove this, we need to show that the integers in the given list are all distinct modulo n and that they cover all the residues modulo n.

First, let's show that the integers in the list are distinct modulo n. Suppose for contradiction that there exist integers i and j (0 ≤ i < j ≤ n - 1) such that
$$c + ia \equiv c + ja \pmod{n}.$$
Then, we have
$$(j - i)a \equiv 0 \pmod{n}.$$
Since gcd(a, n) = 1, we have gcd(j - i, n) = 1. Therefore, we can cancel out (j - i) from both sides of the congruence, which gives us
$$a \equiv 0 \pmod{n}.$$
This contradicts the assumption that gcd(a, n) = 1. Hence, the integers in the list are distinct modulo n.

Next, we need to show that the integers in the list cover all the residues modulo n. Since there are n integers in the list, it suffices to show that the difference between any two consecutive integers in the list is less than n. The difference between two consecutive integers in the list is
$$(c + (i + 1)a) - (c + ia) = a,$$
which is less than n since gcd(a, n) = 1. Therefore, the integers in the list cover all the residues modulo n.

(b) To prove this, we need to show that any n consecutive integers form a complete set of residues modulo n. Let the n consecutive integers be
$$a, a + 1, a + 2, ..., a + n - 1.$$
We need to show that these integers are distinct modulo n and that they cover all the residues modulo n.

First, let's show that the integers are distinct modulo n. Suppose for contradiction that there exist integers i and j (0 ≤ i < j ≤ n - 1) such that
$$a + i \equiv a + j \pmod{n}.$$
Then, we have
$$j - i \equiv 0 \pmod{n}.$$
Since 0 ≤ i < j ≤ n - 1, we have 1 ≤ j - i ≤ n - 1. This implies that gcd(j - i, n) = 1. Therefore, we can cancel out (j - i) from both sides of the congruence, which gives us
$$1 \equiv 0 \pmod{n}.$$
This is a contradiction. Hence, the integers are distinct modulo n.

Next, we need to show that the integers cover all the residues modulo n. Since there are n integers in the list, it suffices to show that the difference between any two consecutive integers in the list is less than n. The difference between two consecutive integers in the list is
$$(a + (i + 1)) - (a + i) = 1,$$
which is less than n. Therefore, the integers in the list cover all the residues modulo n.

(c) To prove this, we need to show that the product of any set of n consecutive integers is divisible by n. Let the n consecutive integers be
$$a, a + 1, a + 2, ..., a + n - 1.$$
The product of these integers is
$$a(a + 1)(a + 2)...(a + n - 1).$$
We can rewrite this product as
$$(a - 1 + 1)(a - 1 + 2)...(a - 1 + n).$$
This is a product of n consecutive integers, and by part (b), we know that any n consecutive integers form a complete set of residues modulo n. Therefore, the product of any set of n consecutive integers is divisible by n.
