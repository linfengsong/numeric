 A repunit is a number that consists of only the digit 1. In this case, $R_6$ is a repunit with 6 digits. 

To factor $R_6$ into a product of primes, we can use the fact that $R_n = 10^n - 1$ for a repunit of length $n$. 

So, $R_6 = 10^6 - 1 = 1000000 - 1 = 999999$.

Now, we can factor 999999 into its prime factors. 

First, we can notice that 999999 is divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits is 45, which is divisible by 3. 

Dividing 999999 by 3, we get 333333. 

Now, we can notice that 333333 is divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits is 18, which is divisible by 3. 

Dividing 333333 by 3, we get 111111. 

Now, we can notice that 111111 is divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits is 6, which is divisible by 3. 

Dividing 111111 by 3, we get 37037. 

Now, we can notice that 37037 is a prime number. 

So, the prime factorization of 999999 is $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 37037$. 

Therefore, the factorization of the repunit $R_6$ into a product of primes is $3^4 \times 37037$.
