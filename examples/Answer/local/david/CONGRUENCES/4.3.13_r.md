 To show that $t_{n+2k} \equiv t_n$ (mod k), we first need to understand what the triangular numbers are. The nth triangular number, $t_n$, is the sum of the first n natural numbers. It can be calculated using the formula $t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

Now, let's calculate $t_{n+2k}$:

$t_{n+2k} = \frac{(n+2k)(n+2k+1)}{2}$

We can rewrite this as:

$t_{n+2k} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + k(n+k+1)$

Notice that the first term is just $t_n$. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

$t_{n+2k} = t_n + k(n+k+1)$

Now, we want to show that $t_{n+2k} \equiv t_n$ (mod k). This means that when we divide $t_{n+2k}$ and $t_n$ by k, the remainders should be the same.

Let's divide both sides of the equation by k:

$\frac{t_{n+2k}}{k} = \frac{t_n}{k} + \frac{k(n+k+1)}{k}$

Simplifying the right side:

$\frac{t_{n+2k}}{k} = \frac{t_n}{k} + n+k+1$

Now, let's look at the remainders when we divide $t_{n+2k}$ and $t_n$ by k:

$t_{n+2k} \equiv t_n$ (mod k)

This means that $t_{n+2k}$ and $t_n$ have the same remainder when divided by k. Since we have shown that $t_{n+2k} = t_n + k(n+k+1)$ and the second term on the right side is a multiple of k, the remainders when $t_{n+2k}$ and $t_n$ are divided by k are the same.

Therefore, $t_{n+2k} \equiv t_n$ (mod k), and $t_n$ and $t_{n+20}$ must have the same last digit.
