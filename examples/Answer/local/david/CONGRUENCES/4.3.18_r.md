 To determine if a number is divisible by 7, 11, and 13, we can use the divisibility rules for each of these numbers.

For 7: A number is divisible by 7 if the difference between twice the last digit and the number formed by the other digits is divisible by 7. For 1010908899, the last digit is 9 and the number formed by the other digits is 101090889. Twice the last digit is 18, and the difference between 18 and 101090889 is 101090871. We can continue this process until we get a number small enough to determine if it's divisible by 7.

101090871 is divisible by 7 because 10109087 - 2*1 = 10109085, 1010908 - 2*5 = 1010903, 101090 - 2*3 = 101084, 10108 - 2*4 = 10100, 1010 - 2*0 = 1010, 101 - 2*0 = 101, 10 - 2*1 = 8, and 8 is divisible by 7.

For 11: A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is divisible by 11. For 1010908899, the sum of the digits in the odd positions is 1 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 9 = 28, and the sum of the digits in the even positions is 0 + 0 + 9 + 8 + 9 = 26. The difference between these two sums is 28 - 26 = 2, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 1010908899 is not divisible by 11.

For 13: A number is divisible by 13 if the difference between the number formed by the last three digits and the number formed by the other digits is divisible by 13. For 1010908899, the last three digits are 899 and the number formed by the other digits is 1010908. The difference between these two numbers is 1010908 - 899 = 1001909. We can continue this process until we get a number small enough to determine if it's divisible by 13.

1001909 is divisible by 13 because 100190 - 9*9 = 10000, 1000 - 9*0 = 1000, 100 - 9*0 = 100, 10 - 9*0 = 10, and 10 is divisible by 13.

Therefore, 1010908899 is divisible by 7 and 13, but not by 11.
