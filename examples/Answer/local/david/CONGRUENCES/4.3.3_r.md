 We want to find the last two digits of $9^{9^9}$.

First, we notice that the last two digits of a number only depend on the remainder when the number is divided by 100. So, we want to find the remainder when $9^{9^9}$ is divided by 100.

We can use the property of modular arithmetic that says if $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$, then $a^c \equiv b^c \pmod{m}$ for any positive integer $c$.

We know that $9 \equiv 9 \pmod{100}$, so $9^{9^9} \equiv 9^{9^9} \pmod{100}$.

Now, we need to find the remainder when $9^9$ is divided by 100. We can use the property of modular arithmetic again to say that if $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$, then $a^c \equiv b^c \pmod{m}$ for any positive integer $c$.

We know that $9 \equiv 9 \pmod{10}$, so $9^9 \equiv 9^9 \pmod{10}$.

We can calculate $9^9$ directly to get $9^9 = 387420489$. The remainder when this is divided by 100 is 89.

So, $9^{9^9} \equiv 9^{89} \pmod{100}$.

Now, we need to find the remainder when $9^{89}$ is divided by 100. We can use the property of modular arithmetic again to say that if $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$, then $a^c \equiv b^c \pmod{m}$ for any positive integer $c$.

We know that $9 \equiv 9 \pmod{10}$, so $9^{89} \equiv 9^{89} \pmod{10}$.

We can calculate $9^{89}$ directly to get $9^{89} = 387420489$. The remainder when this is divided by 100 is 89.

So, the last two digits of $9^{9^9}$ are 89.
