 To prove that $aa_1, aa_2, ..., aa_n$ is a complete set of residues modulo n, we need to show that every $aa_i$ is congruent to a unique residue modulo n and that these residues are distinct.

First, let's show that every $aa_i$ is congruent to a unique residue modulo n. Since $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ is a complete set of residues modulo n, we know that for any $i, j \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$, if $i \neq j$, then $a_i \not\equiv a_j \pmod{n}$. Now, we want to show that $aa_i \equiv aa_j \pmod{n}$ implies $i = j$.

Since gcd(a, n) = 1, we can multiply both sides of the congruence $aa_i \equiv aa_j \pmod{n}$ by the modular inverse of a modulo n, denoted as $a^{-1} \pmod{n}$. This gives us $a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{n}$. Since $a_i$ and $a_j$ are unique residues modulo n, we must have $i = j$. Therefore, every $aa_i$ is congruent to a unique residue modulo n.

Next, we need to show that these residues are distinct. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exist $i, j \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$ such that $i \neq j$ and $aa_i \equiv aa_j \pmod{n}$. As we showed earlier, this implies $a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{n}$, which contradicts the fact that $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ is a complete set of residues modulo n. Therefore, the residues $aa_1, aa_2, ..., aa_n$ must be distinct.

In conclusion, we have shown that every $aa_i$ is congruent to a unique residue modulo n and that these residues are distinct. Therefore, $aa_1, aa_2, ..., aa_n$ is a complete set of residues modulo n.
