 (a) We can start with the first integer as $n$. Then the next two consecutive integers are $n+1$ and $n+2$.

For the first integer $n$, we want it to have a square factor. The smallest square number is $1^2=1$, so we can let $n=1$.

For the second integer $n+1=1+1=2$, it is not divisible by a square number. So we need to find another $n$ such that $n+1$ is divisible by a square number.

The next square number is $2^2=4$, so we can let $n=4$. Then $n+1=4+1=5$, which is divisible by $1^2=1$.

For the third integer $n+2=4+2=6$, it is not divisible by a square number. So we need to find another $n$ such that $n+2$ is divisible by a square number.

The next square number is $3^2=9$, so we can let $n=9$. Then $n+2=9+2=11$, which is divisible by $1^2=1$.

So the three consecutive integers are $1$, $5$, and $11$, each having a square factor.

(b) We can start with the first integer as $n$. Then the next two consecutive integers are $n+1$ and $n+2$.

For the first integer $n$, we want it to be divisible by a square number. The smallest square number is $1^2=1$, so we can let $n=1$.

For the second integer $n+1=1+1=2$, we want it to be divisible by a cube number. The smallest cube number is $1^3=1$, so we can let $n=1$.

For the third integer $n+2=1+2=3$, we want it to be divisible by a fourth power. The smallest fourth power is $1^4=1$, so we can let $n=1$.

So the three consecutive integers are $1$, $2$, and $3$, the first of which is divisible by a square, the second by a cube, and the third by a fourth power.
