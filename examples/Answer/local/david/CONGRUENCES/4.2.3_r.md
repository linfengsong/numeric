 To prove that gcd(a, n) = gcd(b, n), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and n is equal to the gcd of b and n.

Given that $a \equiv b$ (mod n), this means that a and b have the same remainder when divided by n. In other words, a and b are congruent modulo n.

Now, let's consider the gcd(a, n) and gcd(b, n). Since a and b have the same remainder when divided by n, they share the same factors. Therefore, the common divisors of a and n are the same as the common divisors of b and n.

Let d be a common divisor of a and n. Then, d divides both a and n. Since a and b have the same remainder when divided by n, d also divides b. Therefore, d is a common divisor of b and n.

Similarly, let d' be a common divisor of b and n. Then, d' divides both b and n. Since a and b have the same remainder when divided by n, d' also divides a. Therefore, d' is a common divisor of a and n.

Since the common divisors of a and n are the same as the common divisors of b and n, the gcd(a, n) and gcd(b, n) must be equal.

Therefore, we have proven that gcd(a, n) = gcd(b, n) if $a \equiv b$ (mod n).
