 Let $x$ be the number of coins the first pirate got, $y$ be the number of coins the second pirate got, and $z$ be the number of coins the third pirate got.

From the problem, we have the following system of equations:

\begin{align*}
x + y + z + 3 &\equiv 0 \pmod{17} \\
x + y + z + 10 &\equiv 0 \pmod{16} \\
x + y + z &\equiv 0 \pmod{15}
\end{align*}

We can rewrite the first equation as $x + y + z \equiv 14 \pmod{17}$, the second equation as $x + y + z \equiv 6 \pmod{16}$, and the third equation as $x + y + z \equiv 0 \pmod{15}$.

We can subtract the third equation from the first and second equations to get:

\begin{align*}
x + y + z \equiv 14 - 0 \equiv 14 \pmod{17} \\
x + y + z \equiv 6 - 0 \equiv 6 \pmod{16}
\end{align*}

Since $x + y + z$ is the same in both equations, we can set them equal to each other:

$$14 \equiv 6 \pmod{16}$$

This simplifies to:

$$8 \equiv 0 \pmod{16}$$

So, $16$ divides $8$, which is true. Therefore, the system of equations has a solution.

We can find a particular solution by inspection. For example, we can set $x = 10$, $y = 12$, and $z = 3$. This satisfies the first equation:

$$10 + 12 + 3 + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{17}$$

It also satisfies the second equation:

$$10 + 12 + 3 + 10 \equiv 0 \pmod{16}$$

And it satisfies the third equation:

$$10 + 12 + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{15}$$

Therefore, a particular solution is $x = 10$, $y = 12$, and $z = 3$.

The least number of coins that could have been stolen is the smallest common multiple of $17$, $16$, and $15$, plus the number of coins the first pirate got, which is $10$.

The least common multiple of $17$, $16$, and $15$ is $24480$.

Therefore, the least number of coins that could have been stolen is $24480 + 10 = 24490$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{24490}$.
