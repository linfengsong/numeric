 (a) We are given the following congruences:
\[
\begin{cases}
x \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \\
x \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \\
x \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\end{cases}
\]
We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this system of congruences.
From the first congruence, we have $x = 1 + 3a$ for some integer $a$.
Substituting this into the second congruence, we get $1 + 3a \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$, which simplifies to $3a \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$.
Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 3 modulo 5, which is 2, we get $a \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$.
So $a = 2 + 5b$ for some integer $b$.
Substituting this into the expression for $x$, we get $x = 1 + 3(2 + 5b) = 7 + 15b$.
Finally, substituting this into the third congruence, we get $7 + 15b \equiv 3 \pmod{7}$, which simplifies to $15b \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$.
Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 15 modulo 7, which is 3, we get $b \equiv 6 \pmod{7}$.
So $b = 6 + 7c$ for some integer $c$.
Substituting this into the expression for $x$, we get $x = 7 + 15(6 + 7c) = 107 + 105c$.
Therefore, the solution to the system of congruences is $x \equiv 107 \pmod{105}$.

(b) We are given the following congruences:
\[
\begin{cases}
x \equiv 5 \pmod{11} \\
x \equiv 14 \pmod{29} \\
x \equiv 15 \pmod{31}
\end{cases}
\]
We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this system of congruences.
From the first congruence, we have $x = 5 + 11a$ for some integer $a$.
Substituting this into the second congruence, we get $5 + 11a \equiv 14 \pmod{29}$, which simplifies to $11a \equiv 9 \pmod{29}$.
Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 11 modulo 29, which is 2, we get $a \equiv 18 \pmod{29}$.
So $a = 18 + 29b$ for some integer $b$.
Substituting this into the expression for $x$, we get $x = 5 + 11(18 + 29b) = 203 + 319b$.
Finally, substituting this into the third congruence, we get $203 + 319b \equiv 15 \pmod{31}$, which simplifies to $319b \equiv -188 \pmod{31}$.
Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 319 modulo 31, which is 11, we get $b \equiv -188 \cdot 11 \pmod{31}$.
So $b = -188 \cdot 11 + 31c$ for some integer $c$.
Substituting this into the expression for $x$, we get $x = 203 + 319(-188 \cdot 11 + 31c) = 6611 + 9879c$.
Therefore, the solution to the system of congruences is $x \equiv 6611 \pmod{9879}$.

(c) We are given the following congruences:
\[
\begin{cases}
x \equiv 5 \pmod{6} \\
x \equiv 4 \pmod{11} \\
x \equiv 3 \pmod{17}
\end{cases}
\]
We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this system of congruences.
From the first congruence, we have $x = 5 + 6a$ for some integer $a$.
Substituting this into the second congruence, we get $5 + 6a \equiv 4 \pmod{11}$, which simplifies to $6a \equiv -1 \pmod{11}$.
Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 6 modulo 11, which is 2, we get $a \equiv -2 \pmod{11}$.
So $a = -2 + 11b$ for some integer $b$.
Substituting this into the expression for $x$, we get $x = 5 + 6(-2 + 11b) = -7 + 66b$.
Finally, substituting this into the third congruence, we get $-7 + 66b \equiv 3 \pmod{17}$, which simplifies to $66b \equiv 10 \pmod{17}$.
Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 66 modulo 17, which is 12, we get $b \equiv 120 \pmod{17}$.
So $b = 120 + 17c$ for some integer $c$.
Substituting this into the expression for $x$, we get $x = -7 + 66(120 + 17c) = 7955 + 1122c$.
Therefore, the solution to the system of congruences is $x \equiv 7955 \pmod{1122}$.

(d) We are given the following congruences:
\[
\begin{cases}
2x \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \\
3x \equiv 9 \pmod{6} \\
4x \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \\
5x \equiv 9 \pmod{11}
\end{cases}
\]
We can solve each congruence individually:
For the first congruence, we have $2x \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, which simplifies to $x \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$.
For the second congruence, we have $3x \equiv 9 \pmod{6}$, which simplifies to $x \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$.
For the third congruence, we have $4x \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$, which simplifies to $x \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$.
For the fourth congruence, we have $5x \equiv 9 \pmod{11}$, which simplifies to $x \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$.
Now we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this system of congruences.
From the first congruence, we have $x = 3 + 5a$ for some integer $a$.
Substituting this into the second congruence, we get $3 + 5a \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$, which simplifies to $5a \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$.
Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 5 modulo 6, which is 5, we get $a \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$.
So $a = 6b$ for some integer $b$.
Substituting this into the expression for $x$, we get $x = 3 + 5(6b) = 33b$.
Finally, substituting this into the third congruence, we get $33b \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, which simplifies to $4b \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$.
Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 4 modulo 7, which is 2, we get $b \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$.
So $b = 1 + 7c$ for some integer $c$.
Substituting this into the expression for $x$, we get $x = 33(1 + 7c) = 33 + 231c$.
Therefore, the solution to the system of congruences is $x \equiv 33 \pmod{231}$.
The answer is $\boxed{33}$.
