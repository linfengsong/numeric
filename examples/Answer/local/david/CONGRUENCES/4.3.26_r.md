 (a) To find the check digit $a_9$ for the number 55382006, we substitute the digits into the given congruence:
$$a_9 = 7(5) + 3(5) + 9(3) + 7(8) + 3(2) + 9(0) + 7(0) + 3(6) = 35 + 15 + 27 + 56 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 18 = 151\: (mod\: 10)$$
So, $a_9 = 1\: (mod\: 10)$. Therefore, the check digit for 55382006 is 1.

Similarly, for the number 81372439, we substitute the digits into the given congruence:
$$a_9 = 7(8) + 3(1) + 9(3) + 7(7) + 3(2) + 9(4) + 7(3) + 3(9) = 56 + 3 + 27 + 49 + 6 + 36 + 21 + 27 = 213\: (mod\: 10)$$
So, $a_9 = 3\: (mod\: 10)$. Therefore, the check digit for 81372439 is 3.

(b) To find the obscured digit $a_4$, we substitute the known digits into the given congruence:
$$a_9 = 7(2) + 3(3) + 9(7) + 7(a_4) + 3(1) + 9(8) + 7(5) + 3(3) = 14 + 9 + 63 + 7a_4 + 3 + 72 + 35 + 9 = 201 + 7a_4\: (mod\: 10)$$
Since $a_9$ is a digit, it must be between 0 and 9. Therefore, $201 + 7a_4$ must be congruent to 0 modulo 10. We can solve the congruence:
$$201 + 7a_4 \equiv 0\: (mod\: 10)$$
$$7a_4 \equiv -201\: (mod\: 10)$$
$$7a_4 \equiv 9\: (mod\: 10)$$
The smallest positive integer solution for $a_4$ is $a_4 = 3$. Therefore, the obscured digit is 3.
