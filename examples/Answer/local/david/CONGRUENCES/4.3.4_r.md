 To determine if a number is divisible by 9, we can add up its digits and see if the sum is divisible by 9.

For 176521221, the sum of its digits is 1+7+6+5+2+1+2+2+1 = 31, which is not divisible by 9. Therefore, 176521221 is not divisible by 9.

To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can subtract the sum of its odd-positioned digits from the sum of its even-positioned digits. If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11.

For 176521221, the sum of its odd-positioned digits is 1+6+2+2+1 = 10, and the sum of its even-positioned digits is 7+5+1+2 = 15. The difference between these two sums is 15 - 10 = 5, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 176521221 is not divisible by 11.

For 149235678, the sum of its digits is 1+4+9+2+3+5+6+7+8 = 45, which is divisible by 9. Therefore, 149235678 is divisible by 9.

The sum of its odd-positioned digits is 1+9+3+6+8 = 27, and the sum of its even-positioned digits is 4+2+5+7 = 18. The difference between these two sums is 27 - 18 = 9, which is divisible by 11. Therefore, 149235678 is divisible by 11.

In conclusion, 176521221 is not divisible by 9 or 11, and 149235678 is divisible by both 9 and 11.
