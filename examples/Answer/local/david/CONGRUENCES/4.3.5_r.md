 (a) We will prove the generalization of Theorem 4.6 by induction.

Base case: m = 1. If N = a1b + a0, then b - 1 | N if and only if b - 1 | (a1 + a0) by Theorem 4.6.

Inductive step: Assume the result holds for m = k. We will show that the result holds for m = k + 1.

Let N = a_(k+1)b^(k+1) + ... + a2b^2 + a1b + a0, where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ b - 1.

By the inductive hypothesis, b - 1 | (a_(k+1)b^(k+1) + ... + a2b^2 + a1b) if and only if b - 1 | (a_(k+1) + ... + a2 + a1).

Now, b - 1 | N if and only if b - 1 | (a_(k+1)b^(k+1) + ... + a2b^2 + a1b + a0).

By the inductive hypothesis, b - 1 | (a_(k+1)b^(k+1) + ... + a2b^2 + a1b) if and only if b - 1 | (a_(k+1) + ... + a2 + a1).

Therefore, b - 1 | N if and only if b - 1 | (a_(k+1) + ... + a2 + a1 + a0).

(b) To find criteria for the divisibility of N by 3 and 8 that depend on the digits of N when written in the base 9, we can use the generalization of Theorem 4.6.

For divisibility by 3, we have b = 9 and b - 1 = 8. So, 3 | N if and only if 3 | (a_m + ... + a2 + a1 + a0).

For divisibility by 8, we have b = 9 and b - 1 = 8. So, 8 | N if and only if 8 | (a_m + ... + a2 + a1 + a0).

(c) To determine if the integer (447836)_9 is divisible by 3 and 8, we can use the criteria we found in part (b).

For divisibility by 3, we need to find the sum of the digits: 4 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 3 + 6 = 32. Since 3 does not divide 32, (447836)_9 is not divisible by 3.

For divisibility by 8, we need to find the sum of the digits: 4 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 3 + 6 = 32. Since 8 does not divide 32, (447836)_9 is not divisible by 8.

Therefore, the integer (447836)_9 is not divisible by 3 or 8.
