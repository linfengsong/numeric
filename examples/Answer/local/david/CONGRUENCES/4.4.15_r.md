 (a) Let $N$ be the integer we seek. Then $$N\equiv 1\pmod 2,\quad N\equiv 2\pmod 3,\quad N\equiv 5\pmod 6,\quad N\equiv 5\pmod{12}.$$From the first and third congruences, $N$ is odd. Therefore, $N$ is in the form $N=6n+5$. Substituting this into the second congruence, we have $6n+5\equiv 2\pmod 3$, which implies $n\equiv 1\pmod 3$. Thus, $n$ is in the form $n=3m+1$. Substituting $n=3m+1$ into $N=6n+5$, we have $N=6(3m+1)+5=18m+11$. Substituting this into the fourth congruence, we have $18m+11\equiv 5\pmod{12}$, which implies $m\equiv 2\pmod 4$. Thus, $m$ is in the form $m=4p+2$. Substituting $m=4p+2$ into $N=18m+11$, we have $N=18(4p+2)+11=72p+47$. Therefore, the integer we seek is $N=72p+47$ for any integer $p$.

(b) Let $N$ be the integer we seek. Then $$N\equiv 2\pmod 3,\quad N\equiv 3\pmod 4,\quad N\equiv 4\pmod 5,\quad N\equiv 5\pmod 6.$$From the first and fourth congruences, $N$ is odd. Therefore, $N$ is in the form $N=2n+1$. Substituting this into the second congruence, we have $2n+1\equiv 3\pmod 4$, which implies $n\equiv 1\pmod 2$. Thus, $n$ is in the form $n=2m+1$. Substituting $n=2m+1$ into $N=2n+1$, we have $N=2(2m+1)+1=4m+3$. Substituting this into the third congruence, we have $4m+3\equiv 4\pmod 5$, which implies $m\equiv 2\pmod 5$. Thus, $m$ is in the form $m=5p+2$. Substituting $m=5p+2$ into $N=4m+3$, we have $N=4(5p+2)+3=20p+11$. Therefore, the integer we seek is $N=20p+11$ for any integer $p$.

(c) Let $N$ be the integer we seek. Then $$N\equiv 3\pmod{10},\quad N\equiv 11\pmod{13},\quad N\equiv 15\pmod{17}.$$From the first and third congruences, $N$ is in the form $N=17n+15$. Substituting this into the second congruence, we have $17n+15\equiv 11\pmod{13}$, which implies $n\equiv 2\pmod{13}$. Thus, $n$ is in the form $n=13m+2$. Substituting $n=13m+2$ into $N=17n+15$, we have $N=17(13m+2)+15=221m+41$. Therefore, the integer we seek is $N=221m+41$ for any integer $m$.
