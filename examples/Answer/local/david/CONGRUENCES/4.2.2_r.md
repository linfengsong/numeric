 Let's consider the example where $a = 4$, $b = 2$, and $n = 2$. 

We have $a^2 = 4^2 = 16$ and $b^2 = 2^2 = 4$. 

Since $16 \equiv 4$ (mod 2), we have $a^2 \equiv b^2$ (mod n). 

However, $4 \not\equiv 2$ (mod 2), which means $a \not\equiv b$ (mod n). 

This shows that $a^2 \equiv b^2$ (mod n) does not necessarily imply that $a \equiv b$ (mod n).
