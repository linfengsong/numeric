 To show that $2^n$ divides an integer N if and only if $2^n$ divides the number made up of the last n digits of N, we will use the concept of modular arithmetic.

First, let's denote the number made up of the last n digits of N as $N_n$. We can express N as $N = 10^n \cdot N_n + N'$, where $N'$ is the number made up of the first $n$ digits of N.

Now, let's consider the case where $2^n$ divides N. This means that $N \equiv 0 \pmod{2^n}$. Substituting the expression for N, we get $10^n \cdot N_n + N' \equiv 0 \pmod{2^n}$. Since $10^n$ is a multiple of $2^n$, we can simplify this to $N_n + N' \equiv 0 \pmod{2^n}$, which means $2^n$ divides $N_n$.

Now, let's consider the case where $2^n$ divides $N_n$. This means that $N_n \equiv 0 \pmod{2^n}$. Substituting the expression for $N_n$, we get $N - 10^n \cdot N_n \equiv 0 \pmod{2^n}$, which simplifies to $N' \equiv 0 \pmod{2^n}$. This means that $2^n$ divides $N'$, which is the number made up of the first $n$ digits of N.

Therefore, we have shown that $2^n$ divides an integer N if and only if $2^n$ divides the number made up of the last n digits of N.
