 To prove this, we will use the concept of binomial coefficients and the properties of prime numbers.

First, let's recall the definition of a binomial coefficient:

$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

where n! denotes the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.

Now, let's consider the binomial coefficient $\binom{2n}{n}$. We can rewrite it as:

$$\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{n!n!}$$

We are given that p is a prime number such that n < p < 2n. This means that p is a factor of (2n)! but not a factor of n! (since n! is smaller than (2n)! and p is larger than n).

Now, let's consider the factorial (2n)!. We can write it as:

$$(2n)! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot n \cdot (n+1) \cdot (n+2) \cdot \ldots \cdot 2n$$

Notice that every number from n+1 to 2n is larger than n and smaller than 2n. Since p is a factor of (2n)! but not a factor of n!, this means that p must be a factor of at least one of the numbers from n+1 to 2n.

Now, let's consider the binomial coefficient $\binom{2n}{n}$ modulo p:

$$\binom{2n}{n} \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$$

This means that $\binom{2n}{n}$ is divisible by p. Since p is a factor of at least one of the numbers from n+1 to 2n, and $\binom{2n}{n}$ is the product of all these numbers, it follows that $\binom{2n}{n}$ must be divisible by p.

Therefore, we have shown that if p is a prime satisfying n < p < 2n, then $\binom{2n}{n} \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$.
