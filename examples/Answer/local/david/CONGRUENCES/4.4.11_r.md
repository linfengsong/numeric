 First, let's understand the problem. We are given two congruences and we need to prove that they have a simultaneous solution if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of n and m divides the difference between a and b. If a solution exists, we need to confirm that it is unique modulo the least common multiple (lcm) of n and m.

Proof:

(1) Suppose that the congruences admit a simultaneous solution x. Then, x ≡ a (mod n) and x ≡ b (mod m). This means that x - a is a multiple of n and x - b is a multiple of m. Let d = gcd(n, m). Then, d | n and d | m. So, d | (x - a) and d | (x - b). Therefore, d | (x - a) - (x - b) = b - a.

(2) Conversely, suppose that d = gcd(n, m) | a - b. Then, by the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find integers x and y such that nx + my = d. Multiplying both sides by (a - b)/d, we get nx(a - b)/d + my(a - b)/d = a - b. Let x0 = x(a - b)/d and y0 = y(a - b)/d. Then, nx0 + my0 = a - b. So, x0 is a solution to both congruences.

Now, let's prove the uniqueness modulo lcm(n, m).

(3) Suppose that x and y are two solutions to the congruences. Then, x ≡ a (mod n) and y ≡ a (mod n), and x ≡ b (mod m) and y ≡ b (mod m). This means that n | (x - y) and m | (x - y). Let M = lcm(n, m). Then, M = nk for some integer k, and M | (x - y). Therefore, x ≡ y (mod M).

In conclusion, the congruences admit a simultaneous solution if and only if gcd(n, m) | a - b, and if a solution exists, it is unique modulo lcm(n, m).
