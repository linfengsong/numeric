 To verify that $89|2^{44} - 1$ and $97|2^{48} - 1$, we will use the theory of congruences.

First, let's consider the number $2^{44}$. We can rewrite this as $2^{4 \cdot 11}$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that $2^{88} \equiv 1 \pmod{89}$. Therefore, we can rewrite $2^{44}$ as $2^{4 \cdot 11} \equiv (2^4)^{11} \equiv 16^{11} \pmod{89}$.

Now, let's consider the number $2^{48}$. We can rewrite this as $2^{4 \cdot 12}$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that $2^{96} \equiv 1 \pmod{97}$. Therefore, we can rewrite $2^{48}$ as $2^{4 \cdot 12} \equiv (2^4)^{12} \equiv 16^{12} \pmod{97}$.

Now, we need to find the remainders of $16^{11}$ and $16^{12}$ when divided by $89$ and $97$, respectively. We can do this by using the property of congruences that if $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$, then $a^n \equiv b^n \pmod{m}$.

We know that $16^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{89}$ and $16^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{97}$. Therefore, we can rewrite $16^{11}$ and $16^{12}$ as follows:

$16^{11} \equiv (16^3)^3 \cdot 16^2 \equiv 1^3 \cdot 16^2 \equiv 256 \equiv 1 \pmod{89}$

$16^{12} \equiv (16^3)^4 \equiv 1^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{97}$

Now, we can see that $16^{11} \equiv 1 \pmod{89}$ and $16^{12} \equiv 1 \pmod{97}$. Therefore, we have $2^{44} \equiv 16^{11} \equiv 1 \pmod{89}$ and $2^{48} \equiv 16^{12} \equiv 1 \pmod{97}$.

This means that $89|2^{44} - 1$ and $97|2^{48} - 1$.
