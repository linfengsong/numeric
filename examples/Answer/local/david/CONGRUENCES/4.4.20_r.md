 (a) We can solve this system of congruences using the method of substitution or elimination.
Let's use the elimination method.
Multiply the first congruence by 2 and the second congruence by 3 to eliminate the y terms:
$10x + 6y \equiv 2$ (mod 7)
$9x + 6y \equiv 12$ (mod 7)
Now subtract the second congruence from the first:
$x \equiv -10$ (mod 7)
Simplifying, we get:
$x \equiv 3$ (mod 7)
Now substitute this value of x back into one of the original congruences to find the value of y.
Let's use the first congruence:
$5(3) + 3y \equiv 1$ (mod 7)
$15 + 3y \equiv 1$ (mod 7)
$3y \equiv -14$ (mod 7)
$3y \equiv 0$ (mod 7)
$y \equiv 0$ (mod 7)
So the solution to the system of congruences is $x \equiv 3$ (mod 7) and $y \equiv 0$ (mod 7).

(b) We can solve this system of congruences using the same method as in part (a).
Multiply the first congruence by 4 and the second congruence by 7 to eliminate the y terms:
$28x + 12y \equiv 24$ (mod 11)
$28x + 14y \equiv 63$ (mod 11)
Now subtract the first congruence from the second:
$2y \equiv 39$ (mod 11)
$2y \equiv 8$ (mod 11)
$y \equiv 4$ (mod 11)
Now substitute this value of y back into one of the original congruences to find the value of x.
Let's use the first congruence:
$7x + 3(4) \equiv 6$ (mod 11)
$7x + 12 \equiv 6$ (mod 11)
$7x \equiv -6$ (mod 11)
$7x \equiv 5$ (mod 11)
$x \equiv 7$ (mod 11)
So the solution to the system of congruences is $x \equiv 7$ (mod 11) and $y \equiv 4$ (mod 11).

(c) We can solve this system of congruences using the same method as in part (a).
Multiply the first congruence by 3 and the second congruence by 5 to eliminate the y terms:
$33x + 15y \equiv 21$ (mod 20)
$30x + 15y \equiv 40$ (mod 20)
Now subtract the second congruence from the first:
$3x \equiv -19$ (mod 20)
$3x \equiv 1$ (mod 20)
$x \equiv 7$ (mod 20)
Now substitute this value of x back into one of the original congruences to find the value of y.
Let's use the first congruence:
$11(7) + 5y \equiv 7$ (mod 20)
$77 + 5y \equiv 7$ (mod 20)
$5y \equiv -70$ (mod 20)
$5y \equiv 0$ (mod 20)
$y \equiv 0$ (mod 20)
So the solution to the system of congruences is $x \equiv 7$ (mod 20) and $y \equiv 0$ (mod 20).
The answer is $\boxed{x\equiv3\pmod{7},y\equiv0\pmod{7};x\equiv7\pmod{11},y\equiv4\pmod{11};x\equiv7\pmod{20},y\equiv0\pmod{20}}$.
