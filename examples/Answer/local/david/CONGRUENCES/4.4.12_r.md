 To show that the system of congruences does not possess a solution, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The given congruences are:

$$x \equiv 5 \pmod{6}$$
$$x \equiv 7 \pmod{15}$$

First, we check if the moduli are pairwise coprime. Since 6 and 15 are not coprime (they share a common factor of 3), the Chinese Remainder Theorem does not guarantee a unique solution.

However, we can still attempt to find a solution. From the first congruence, we have:

$$x = 5 + 6k$$

Substituting this into the second congruence, we get:

$$5 + 6k \equiv 7 \pmod{15}$$

Simplifying, we have:

$$6k \equiv 2 \pmod{15}$$

Now, we need to find a value of k that satisfies this congruence. We can start by checking the multiples of 6 modulo 15:

$$6 \cdot 1 = 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{15}$$
$$6 \cdot 2 = 12 \equiv 12 \pmod{15}$$
$$6 \cdot 3 = 18 \equiv 3 \pmod{15}$$
$$6 \cdot 4 = 24 \equiv 9 \pmod{15}$$
$$6 \cdot 5 = 30 \equiv 0 \pmod{15}$$
$$6 \cdot 6 = 36 \equiv 6 \pmod{15}$$
$$6 \cdot 7 = 42 \equiv 12 \pmod{15}$$
$$6 \cdot 8 = 48 \equiv 3 \pmod{15}$$
$$6 \cdot 9 = 54 \equiv 9 \pmod{15}$$
$$6 \cdot 10 = 60 \equiv 0 \pmod{15}$$

We can see that there is no value of k that satisfies the congruence $6k \equiv 2 \pmod{15}$. Therefore, the system of congruences does not possess a solution.
