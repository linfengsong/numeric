 We are given that 792 divides the integer 13xy 45z. This means that 13xy 45z is a multiple of 792.

First, let's find the prime factorization of 792. We can do this by dividing 792 by prime numbers starting from 2 and continuing until we can't divide anymore.

792 ÷ 2 = 396
396 ÷ 2 = 198
198 ÷ 2 = 99
99 ÷ 3 = 33
33 ÷ 3 = 11
11 is a prime number, so we stop here.

So, the prime factorization of 792 is 2^3 * 3^2 * 11.

Now, let's consider the integer 13xy 45z. We know that it is a multiple of 792, so it must be divisible by each of the prime factors of 792.

Since 13xy 45z is divisible by 2^3, the last three digits of the integer, 45z, must be divisible by 2^3 = 8. The only three-digit number that is divisible by 8 and ends with 5z is 450, so z = 0.

Now, let's consider the divisibility by 3^2 = 9. The sum of the digits of the integer must be divisible by 9. So, 1 + 3 + x + y + 4 + 5 + 0 = 13 + x + y must be divisible by 9. The smallest value of x + y that satisfies this condition is x + y = 2, which gives us x = 2 and y = 0.

Therefore, the digits x, y, and z are 2, 0, and 0, respectively.
