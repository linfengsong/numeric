 The check digit is calculated by taking the sum of the product of each digit and its position, and then taking the remainder when divided by 10. In other words, the check digit is given by:

$a_1 + 2a_2 + 3a_3 + \cdots + 9a_9 \equiv 0 \pmod{10}$

Now, let's say that two unequal digits were transposed in the ISBN. Let's say that the digits $a_i$ and $a_j$ were transposed, where $i \neq j$. 

After the transposition, the new ISBN is $a_1a_2 \cdots a_{i-1}a_j \cdots a_{j-1}a_i \cdots a_9$. 

Let's calculate the new check digit:

$a_1 + 2a_2 + \cdots + (i-1)a_{i-1} + ja_{j-1} + (j-1)a_{j-1} + ia_i + \cdots + 9a_9 \equiv 0 \pmod{10}$

Notice that the terms $a_1 + 2a_2 + \cdots + (i-1)a_{i-1} + ja_{j-1} + (j-1)a_{j-1} + ia_i + \cdots + 9a_9$ and $a_1 + 2a_2 + \cdots + 9a_9$ are congruent modulo 10. This is because the only terms that have changed are $ia_i$ and $ja_j$, and these terms cancel each other out when we take the difference.

Therefore, the new check digit is congruent to the original check digit modulo 10. However, this is a contradiction, because the original check digit was 0, and the new check digit is not 0. 

Therefore, the check digit must have detected the error.
