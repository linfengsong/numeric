 To prove this, we need to show that if $x$ is congruent to $a$ modulo $n$, then $x$ is either congruent to $a$ modulo $2n$ or $x$ is congruent to $a + n$ modulo $2n$.

Let's start by defining the given information:

1. $x \equiv a$ (mod n)

Now, we want to show that either $x \equiv a$ (mod 2n) or $x \equiv a + n$ (mod 2n).

Since $x \equiv a$ (mod n), we can write $x = a + kn$ for some integer $k$.

Now, we consider two cases:

Case 1: $k$ is even
If $k$ is even, we can write $k = 2m$ for some integer $m$. Then, we have:

$x = a + kn = a + 2mn = a + n(2m)$

Since $2m$ is an integer, we can say that $x \equiv a + n$ (mod 2n).

Case 2: $k$ is odd
If $k$ is odd, we can write $k = 2m + 1$ for some integer $m$. Then, we have:

$x = a + kn = a + (2m + 1)n = a + n(2m + 1)$

Since $2m + 1$ is an integer, we can say that $x \equiv a$ (mod 2n).

In both cases, we have shown that either $x \equiv a$ (mod 2n) or $x \equiv a + n$ (mod 2n). Therefore, the original statement is proven.
