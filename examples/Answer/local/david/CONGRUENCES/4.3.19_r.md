 (a) Let's consider the number N with n digits, i.e., N = a_(n-1)a_(n-2)...a_2a_1a_0, where a_i are the digits of N. Then, M = a_0a_1a_2...a_(n-2)a_(n-1).

Now, let's subtract M from N:

N - M = (a_(n-1)a_(n-2)...a_2a_1a_0) - (a_0a_1a_2...a_(n-2)a_(n-1))

We can rewrite this as:

N - M = (a_(n-1) - a_0) * 10^(n-1) + (a_(n-2) - a_1) * 10^(n-2) + ... + (a_2 - a_(n-3)) * 10^2 + (a_1 - a_(n-2)) * 10 + (a_0 - a_(n-1))

Notice that each term in the sum is a multiple of 10, except for the last term. Therefore, we can rewrite the sum as:

N - M = 9 * (a_(n-1) * 10^(n-1) + a_(n-2) * 10^(n-2) + ... + a_2 * 10^2 + a_1 * 10)

Since 9 is a multiple of 9, we have shown that N - M is divisible by 9.

(b) Let's consider a palindrome P with an even number of digits, i.e., P = a_(n-1)a_(n-2)...a_2a_1a_0a_1a_2...a_(n-2)a_(n-1).

We can rewrite P as:

P = a_(n-1) * 10^(n-1) + a_(n-2) * 10^(n-2) + ... + a_2 * 10^2 + a_1 * 10 + a_0 + a_1 * 10^(-1) + a_2 * 10^(-2) + ... + a_(n-2) * 10^(-(n-2)) + a_(n-1) * 10^(-(n-1))

Now, let's subtract P from its reverse, R:

R - P = (a_0 + a_1 * 10^(-1) + a_2 * 10^(-2) + ... + a_(n-2) * 10^(-(n-2)) + a_(n-1) * 10^(-(n-1))) - (a_(n-1) * 10^(n-1) + a_(n-2) * 10^(n-2) + ... + a_2 * 10^2 + a_1 * 10 + a_0)

Notice that each term in the sum is a multiple of 10, except for the last term. Therefore, we can rewrite the sum as:

R - P = 9 * (a_0 * 10^(-1) + a_1 * 10^(-2) + ... + a_(n-2) * 10^(-(n-1)) + a_(n-1) * 10^(-n))

Since 9 is a multiple of 11, we have shown that R - P is divisible by 11.
