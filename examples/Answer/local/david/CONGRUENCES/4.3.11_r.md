 We can use the divisibility rule for 5, which states that a number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. Therefore, y must be 0 or 5.

We can also use the divisibility rule for 3, which states that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 273x49y5 is 2+7+3+x+4+9+y+5 = 30+x+y.

If y=0, then 30+x+y = 30+x, and since 30 is divisible by 3, x must also be divisible by 3. The only digit that satisfies this condition is x=3.

If y=5, then 30+x+y = 35+x, and since 35 is not divisible by 3, x must be such that 35+x is divisible by 3. The only digit that satisfies this condition is x=1.

Therefore, the possible values for x and y are (x, y) = (3, 0) or (x, y) = (1, 5).
