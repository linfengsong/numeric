 To verify that a set of numbers forms a complete set of residues modulo $n$, we need to check two conditions:

1. Each number in the set is congruent to exactly one number in the set modulo $n$.
2. The set contains exactly $n$ numbers.

Let's first check the first set of numbers, $0, 1, 2, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^9$.

1. Each number in the set is congruent to exactly one number in the set modulo 11:

   - $0 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$
   - $1 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$
   - $2 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$
   - $2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}$
   - $2^3 \equiv 8 \pmod{11}$
   - $2^4 \equiv 5 \pmod{11}$
   - $2^5 \equiv 10 \pmod{11}$
   - $2^6 \equiv 9 \pmod{11}$
   - $2^7 \equiv 7 \pmod{11}$
   - $2^8 \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$
   - $2^9 \equiv 6 \pmod{11}$

   We can see that each number in the set is congruent to a unique number in the set modulo 11.

2. The set contains exactly 11 numbers:

   The set $0, 1, 2, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^9$ contains 10 numbers. However, we are missing the number $2^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$, which is not in the set. So, the set does not contain exactly 11 numbers.

Since the first condition is not satisfied, the set $0, 1, 2, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^9$ does not form a complete set of residues modulo 11.

Now, let's check the second set of numbers, $0, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ..., 10^2$.

1. Each number in the set is congruent to exactly one number in the set modulo 11:

   - $0 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$
   - $1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$
   - $2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}$
   - $3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{11}$
   - $4^2 \equiv 5 \pmod{11}$
   - $5^2 \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$
   - $6^2 \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$
   - $7^2 \equiv 5 \pmod{11}$
   - $8^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{11}$
   - $9^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{11}$
   - $10^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$

   We can see that each number in the set is congruent to a unique number in the set modulo 11.

2. The set contains exactly 11 numbers:

   The set $0, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ..., 10^2$ contains 11 numbers.

Since both conditions are satisfied, the set $0, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ..., 10^2$ forms a complete set of residues modulo 11.
