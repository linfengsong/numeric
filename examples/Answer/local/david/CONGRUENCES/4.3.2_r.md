 (a) The units digit of $a^2$ is the units digit of the square of the units digit of $a$. The units digit of the square of an integer is always one of 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.

(b) The units digit of $a^3$ is the units digit of the cube of the units digit of $a$. The units digit of the cube of an integer can be any digit from 0 to 9.

(c) The units digit of $a^4$ is the units digit of the fourth power of the units digit of $a$. The units digit of the fourth power of an integer is always one of 0, 1, 5, or 6.

(d) A triangular number is given by the formula $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ for some integer $n$. The units digit of this expression is the units digit of the product of the units digits of $n$ and $n+1$. Since the units digit of $n+1$ is the same as the units digit of $n$ plus 1, the units digit of the product is the units digit of the square of the units digit of $n$ plus the units digit of $n$. This means that the units digit of a triangular number is always one of 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, or 8.
