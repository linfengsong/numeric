 Let $n$ be the number of eggs in the basket. We are given that $n\equiv 1\pmod{2}$, $n\equiv 1\pmod{3}$, $n\equiv 1\pmod{4}$, $n\equiv 1\pmod{5}$, and $n\equiv 0\pmod{6}$.

The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that the first four congruences imply $n\equiv 1\pmod{60}$. Therefore, $n$ is in the form $n=60k+1$ for some integer $k$. We want the smallest such $n$ that is also divisible by $6$. Checking the numbers in the form $60k+1$, we find that $60(1)+1=61$ is not divisible by $6$, but $60(2)+1=121$ is. Therefore, the smallest number of eggs that could have been in the basket is $\boxed{121}$.
