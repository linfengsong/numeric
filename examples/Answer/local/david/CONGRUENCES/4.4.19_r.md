 To solve the linear congruence $3x + 4y \equiv 5$ (mod 8), we can use the following steps:

1. Rewrite the congruence in the form $ax + by \equiv c$ (mod m), where a, b, and m are known, and x and y are the variables we want to solve for. In this case, we have $3x + 4y \equiv 5$ (mod 8).

2. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b, and check if it divides m. In this case, the GCD of 3 and 4 is 1, which divides 8.

3. Since the GCD of 3 and 4 divides 8, we can find a solution to the congruence. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which states that there exist integers x and y such that $ax + by = \text{GCD}(a, b)$. In this case, we have $3x + 4y = 1$.

4. Multiply both sides of the equation by c, the constant on the right side of the original congruence. In this case, we have $3x + 4y = 5$.

5. Now, we can find the general solution for x and y by adding multiples of m/GCD(a, b) to the particular solution we found in step 4. In this case, we have $x = 5 + 8k$ and $y = -3 + 8k$, where k is an integer.

6. To find the eight incongruent solutions, we can substitute different values of k into the general solution and reduce the results modulo 8. We can start with k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 7.

Here are the eight incongruent solutions:

- For k = 0: $x = 5$ (mod 8), $y = -3$ (mod 8)
- For k = 1: $x = 13$ (mod 8) = 5 (mod 8), $y = 5$ (mod 8)
- For k = 2: $x = 21$ (mod 8) = 5 (mod 8), $y = 13$ (mod 8) = 5 (mod 8)
- For k = 3: $x = 29$ (mod 8) = 5 (mod 8), $y = 21$ (mod 8) = 5 (mod 8)
- For k = 4: $x = 37$ (mod 8) = 1 (mod 8), $y = 29$ (mod 8) = 5 (mod 8)
- For k = 5: $x = 45$ (mod 8) = 1 (mod 8), $y = 37$ (mod 8) = 1 (mod 8)
- For k = 6: $x = 53$ (mod 8) = 1 (mod 8), $y = 45$ (mod 8) = 1 (mod 8)
- For k = 7: $x = 61$ (mod 8) = 5 (mod 8), $y = 53$ (mod 8) = 1 (mod 8)

So, the eight incongruent solutions of the linear congruence $3x + 4y \equiv 5$ (mod 8) are:

1. $(x, y) = (5, -3)$
2. $(x, y) = (5, 5)$
3. $(x, y) = (5, 13)$
4. $(x, y) = (5, 21)$
5. $(x, y) = (1, 29)$
6. $(x, y) = (1, 37)$
7. $(x, y) = (1, 45)$
8. $(x, y) = (5, 53)$
