 To solve this system of congruences, we will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. First, we need to find the modular inverses of the coefficients of $x$ in each congruence.

For the first congruence, $2x \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, we need to find the inverse of $2$ modulo $5$. Since $2$ and $5$ are coprime, the inverse exists. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find it:

$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
\text{Step} & \text{Equation} & \text{Remainder} \\
\hline
0 & 5 = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 & 1 \\
1 & 2 = 1 \cdot 2 + 0 & 0
\end{array}
$$

From the second row of the table, we have $1 = 5 - 2 \cdot 2$. Multiplying both sides by $3$ (the inverse of $2$ modulo $5$), we get $3 = 15 - 6 \cdot 2$. Since $15 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$, we have $3 \equiv -6 \pmod{5}$, which means the inverse of $2$ modulo $5$ is $-3$ or $2$.

For the second congruence, $4x \equiv 2 \pmod{6}$, we need to find the inverse of $4$ modulo $6$. Since $4$ and $6$ are not coprime, the inverse does not exist. However, we can simplify the congruence by dividing both sides by $2$:

$$
2x \equiv 1 \pmod{3}
$$

Now, we need to find the inverse of $2$ modulo $3$. Using the extended Euclidean algorithm:

$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
\text{Step} & \text{Equation} & \text{Remainder} \\
\hline
0 & 3 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 & 1 \\
1 & 2 = 1 \cdot 2 + 0 & 0
\end{array}
$$

From the second row of the table, we have $1 = 3 - 2 \cdot 1$. Multiplying both sides by $1$ (the inverse of $2$ modulo $3$), we get $1 = 3 - 2$. Since $3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$, we have $1 \equiv -2 \pmod{3}$, which means the inverse of $2$ modulo $3$ is $-1$ or $2$.

For the third congruence, $3x \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, we need to find the inverse of $3$ modulo $7$. Using the extended Euclidean algorithm:

$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
\text{Step} & \text{Equation} & \text{Remainder} \\
\hline
0 & 7 = 3 \cdot 2 + 1 & 1 \\
1 & 3 = 1 \cdot 3 + 0 & 0
\end{array}
$$

From the second row of the table, we have $1 = 7 - 3 \cdot 2$. Multiplying both sides by $1$ (the inverse of $3$ modulo $7$), we get $1 = 7 - 6$. Since $7 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, we have $1 \equiv -6 \pmod{7}$, which means the inverse of $3$ modulo $7$ is $-2$ or $5$.

Now, we can substitute the modular inverses back into the congruences:

$$
x \equiv 3 \cdot 2 \pmod{5} \\
x \equiv 1 \cdot 2 \pmod{3} \\
x \equiv 2 \cdot 5 \pmod{7}
$$

Solving these congruences, we get:

$$
x \equiv 6 \pmod{5} \\
x \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \\
x \equiv 10 \pmod{7}
$$

Now, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the solution modulo $210 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$. Since $5$ and $7$ are coprime, we can use the following formula:

$$
x \equiv a_1M_1y_1 + a_2M_2y_2 \pmod{210}
$$

where $a_1 = 6$, $a_2 = 10$, $M_1 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 = 42$, $M_2 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 30$, $y_1$ is the inverse of $M_1$ modulo $5$, and $y_2$ is the inverse of $M_2$ modulo $7$.

First, we need to find the inverses of $M_1$ and $M_2$:

$$
M_1 \equiv 42 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \\
M_2 \equiv 30 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}
$$

Since $M_1$ and $M_2$ are multiples of $5$ and $7$, respectively, their inverses modulo $5$ and $7$ are $1$. Now, we can find the solution:

$$
x \equiv 6 \cdot 42 \cdot 1 + 10 \cdot 30 \cdot 1 \pmod{210} \\
x \equiv 252 + 300 \pmod{210} \\
x \equiv 552 \pmod{210}
$$

Since $552 \equiv 342 \pmod{210}$, the solution is $x \equiv 342 \pmod{210}$.

However, this is not the only solution. Since $210 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$, we can add multiples of $210$ to the solution and still satisfy the original congruences. Therefore, the two incongruent solutions modulo $210$ are:

$$
x \equiv 342 \pmod{210} \\
x \equiv 342 + 210 \pmod{210} \\
x \equiv 552 \pmod{210}
$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$
x \equiv 342 \pmod{210} \\
x \equiv 552 \pmod{210}
$$
