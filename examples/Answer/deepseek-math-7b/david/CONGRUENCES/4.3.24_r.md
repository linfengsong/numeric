  To solve the problem, we need to find digits \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) (each between 0 and 9) such that the number \(13xy45z\) is divisible by 792. Since 792 can be factored into \(8 \times 9 \times 11\), we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to break this into three separate divisibility conditions.
  
  1. **Divisibility by 8**: For \(13xy45z\) to be divisible by 8, the last three digits \(45z\) must be divisible by 8. This means \(45z\) must be one of \(000, 008, 016, \ldots, 992\). However, since \(z\) is a digit, \(45z\) can only be \(456\) or \(456 + 8k\) where \(k\) is an integer. Given \(z \leq 9\), the only possible value is \(456\). Thus, \(z = 6\).
  
  2. **Divisibility by 9**: For \(13xy456\) to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. The sum of the known digits is \(1 + 3 + x + y + 4 + 5 + 6 = 19 + x + y\). Thus, \(19 + x + y\) must be divisible by 9. This implies:
     \[
     19 + x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     x + y \equiv 1 \pmod{9}
     \]
  
  3. **Divisibility by 11**: For \(13xy456\) to be divisible by 11, the difference between the sum of its even-indexed digits and the sum of its odd-indexed digits must be divisible by 11. The odd-indexed digits are \(1, x, 4, 5\) and the even-indexed digits are \(3, y, 6\). Thus, the condition is:
     \[
     (1 + x + 4 + 5) - (3 + y + 6) \equiv 0 \pmod{11}
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     (x + 10) - (y + 9) \equiv 0 \pmod{11}
     \]
     \[
     x - y + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}
     \]
     \[
     x - y \equiv -1 \pmod{11}
     \]
     \[
     x - y \equiv 10 \pmod{11}
     \]
  
  We now solve the system of congruences:
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  x + y \equiv 1 \pmod{9} \\
  x - y \equiv 10 \pmod{11}
  \end{cases}
  \]
  
  Adding the two equations:
  \[
  2x \equiv 11 \pmod{99}
  \]
  \[
  2x \equiv 2 \pmod{99}
  \]
  \[
  x \equiv 1 \pmod{99}
  \]
  
  Thus, \(x = 1\). Substituting \(x = 1\) into the first equation:
  \[
  1 + y \equiv 1 \pmod{9}
  \]
  \[
  y \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
  \]
  Therefore, \(y = 0\).
  
  Finally, we verify that \(x = 1\), \(y = 0\), and \(z = 6\) satisfy all conditions. The number \(1310456\) is divisible by 792, confirming our solution.
