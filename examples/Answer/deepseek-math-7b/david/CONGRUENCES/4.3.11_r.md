### Normal Language Explanation
1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find digits \( x \) and \( y \) (each between 0 and 9) such that the number \( 273x49y5 \) is divisible by 495.
2. **Divisibility by 495**: Since 495 = 5 × 9 × 11, the number must be divisible by each of these factors.
3. **Check Divisibility by 5**: The last digit must be 0 or 5. Thus, \( y = 0 \) or \( y = 5 \).
4. **Check Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits must be divisible by 9.
   - For \( y = 0 \): Sum = 2 + 7 + 3 + x + 4 + 9 + 0 + 5 = 2 + 7 + 3 + x + 4 + 9 + 0 + 5 = 2 + 7 = 9; 9 + 3 = 12; 12 + 4 = 16; 16 + 9 = 25; 25 + 5 = 30. So, 30 + x must be divisible by 9. Thus, x = 6.
   - For \( y = 5 \): Sum = 2 + 7 + 3 + x + 4 + 9 + 5 + 5 = 2 + 7 = 9; 9 + 3 = 12; 12 + 4 = 16; 16 + 9 = 25; 25 + 5 = 30; 30 + 5 = 35. So, 35 + x must be divisible by 9. Thus, x = 1.
5. **Check Divisibility by 11**: Alternating sum must be divisible by 11.
   - For \( y = 0 \), \( x = 6 \): Alternating sum = 2 - 7 + 3 - 6 + 4 - 9 + 0 - 5 = (2 + 3 + 4) - (7 + 6 + 9 + 5) = 9 - 27 = -18. -18 is divisible by 11.
   - For \( y = 5 \), \( x = 1 \): Alternating sum = 2 - 7 + 3 - 1 + 4 - 9 + 5 - 5 = (2 + 3 + 4 + 5) - (7 + 1 + 9 + 5) = 14 - 22 = -8. -8 is not divisible by 11.
6. **Conclusion**: The only valid solution is \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 0 \).

### Final Answer
The digits \( x \) and \( y \) are \( \boxed{6} \) and \( \boxed{0} \), respectively.
