### Explanation
The problem is to find the smallest number of eggs \( n \) that satisfies the following conditions:
1. \( n \equiv 1 \mod 2 \)
2. \( n \equiv 2 \mod 3 \)
3. \( n \equiv 3 \mod 4 \)
4. \( n \equiv 4 \mod 5 \)
5. \( n \equiv 5 \mod 6 \)
6. \( n \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

We start by finding a number \( n \) that satisfies all the conditions. The smallest such number is 119, which can be verified by checking each condition:
- \( 119 \mod 2 = 1 \)
- \( 119 \mod 3 = 2 \)
- \( 119 \mod 4 = 3 \)
- \( 119 \mod 5 = 4 \)
- \( 119 \mod 6 = 5 \)
- \( 119 \mod 7 = 0 \)

Thus, 119 is the smallest number of eggs that satisfies all the given conditions.
