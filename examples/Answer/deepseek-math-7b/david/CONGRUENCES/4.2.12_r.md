### (a) If gcd(a, n) = 1, then the integers
$$c, c +a, c + 2a, c + 3a, ..., c + (n - l)a$$
form a complete set of residues modulo n for any c.

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
```lean4
theorem complete_set_of_residues_a (a n : ℕ) (h : Nat.gcd a n = 1) (c : ℕ) :
    (Finset.range n).image (fun k => c + k * a) = Finset.Icc c (c + (n - 1) * a) := by
  ext x
  simp [Finset.mem_image, Finset.mem_range, Nat.mod_eq_of_lt]
  constructor
  -- First direction: if x is in the image, then it is in the interval
  · rintro ⟨k, hk, rfl⟩
    omega
  -- Second direction: if x is in the interval, then it is in the image
  · intro hx
    have h₁ : x ≥ c := by linarith [hx.1]
    have h₂ : x ≤ c + (n - 1) * a := by linarith [hx.2]
    use (x - c) / a
    have h₃ : (x - c) % a = 0 := by
      have h₄ : Nat.gcd a n = 1 := h
      have h₅ : a ∣ x - c := by
        use (x - c) / a
        have h₆ : x = c + (x - c) := by omega
        omega
      have h₆ : a ∣ x - c := by simpa using h₅
      have h₇ : (x - c) % a = 0 := Nat.mod_eq_zero_of_dvd h₆
      exact h₇
    have h₄ : (x - c) / a < n := by
      have h₅ : x ≤ c + (n - 1) * a := by linarith [hx.2]
      have h₆ : (x - c) / a < n := by
        apply Nat.div_lt_of_lt_mul
        have h₇ : x - c < n * a := by omega
        nlinarith
      exact h₆
    omega
```

**Normal Language Proof:**
1. **Completeness**: The set \( \{c, c + a, \dots, c + (n-1)a\} \) has \( n \) distinct residues modulo \( n \).
2. **Distinctness**: Suppose \( c + ka \equiv c + ma \mod n \). Then \( (k - m)a \equiv 0 \mod n \). Since \( \gcd(a, n) = 1 \), \( k \equiv m \mod n \). But \( 0 \leq k, m < n \), so \( k = m \).

### (b) Any n consecutive integers form a complete set of residues modulo n

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
```lean4
theorem complete_set_of_residues_b (n : ℕ) (c : ℕ) :
    (Finset.range n).image (fun k => c + k) = Finset.Icc c (c + n - 1) := by
  ext x
  simp [Finset.mem_image, Finset.mem_range, Nat.mod_eq_of_lt]
  constructor
  -- First direction: if x is in the image, then it is in the interval
  · rintro ⟨k, hk, rfl⟩
    omega
  -- Second direction: if x is in the interval, then it is in the image
  · intro hx
    have h₁ : x ≥ c := by linarith [hx.1]
    have h₂ : x ≤ c + n - 1 := by linarith [hx.2]
    use x - c
    have h₃ : x - c < n := by omega
    have h₄ : x = c + (x - c) := by omega
    omega
```

**Normal Language Proof:**
1. **Completeness**: The set \( \{c, c + 1, \dots, c + n - 1\} \) has \( n \) distinct residues modulo \( n \).
2. **Distinctness**: Suppose \( c + k \equiv c + m \mod n \). Then \( k \equiv m \mod n \). But \( 0 \leq k, m < n \), so \( k = m \).

### (c) The product of any set of n consecutive integers is divisible by n.

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
```lean4
theorem product_divisible_by_n (n : ℕ) (c : ℕ) : n ∣ (Finset.Icc c (c + n - 1)).prod id := by
  have h : (Finset.Icc c (c + n - 1)).prod id = ∏ k in Finset.Icc c (c + n - 1), k := by
    simp [Finset.prod_eq_multiset_prod]
  rw [h]
  apply Nat.dvd_of_mod_eq_zero
  rcases n with (_ | _ | n) <;>
    rcases c with (_ | c) <;>
    simp [Finset.prod_Icc_succ_top, Nat.mul_mod, Nat.add_mod, Nat.mod_eq_of_lt]
  <;>
  norm_num <;>
  omega
```

**Normal Language Proof:**
1. **Divisibility by primes**: For each prime \( p \leq n \), the product contains at least one multiple of \( p \).
2. **Divisibility by powers**: For each prime power \( p^k \leq n \), the product contains at least \( k \) factors divisible by \( p \).
3. **Conclusion**: The product is divisible by all primes and their powers up to \( n \), hence by \( n \).
