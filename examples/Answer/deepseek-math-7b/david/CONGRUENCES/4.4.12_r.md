### Explanation

1. **Assume a solution exists**: We start by assuming there exists an integer \( x \) that satisfies both congruences \( x \equiv 5 \pmod{6} \) and \( x \equiv 7 \pmod{15} \).

2. **Translate congruences to equations**:
   - \( x \equiv 5 \pmod{6} \) implies \( x = 6k + 5 \) for some integer \( k \).
   - \( x \equiv 7 \pmod{15} \) implies \( x = 15m + 7 \) for some integer \( m \).

3. **Set the two expressions for \( x \) equal**:
   - \( 6k + 5 = 15m + 7 \).

4. **Solve for \( k \) and \( m \)**:
   - Rearrange to \( 6k - 15m = 2 \).
   - Simplify to \( 2k - 5m = \frac{2}{3} \), which is impossible since \( k \) and \( m \) are integers.

5. **Contradiction**: The equation \( 2k - 5m = \frac{2}{3} \) has no integer solutions, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, no such \( x \) exists.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **Assume a solution exists**: Suppose there is an integer \( x \) that satisfies both \( x \equiv 5 \pmod{6} \) and \( x \equiv 7 \pmod{15} \).

2. **Express \( x \) in terms of moduli**:
   - From \( x \equiv 5 \pmod{6} \), we can write \( x = 6k + 5 \) for some integer \( k \).
   - From \( x \equiv 7 \pmod{15} \), we can write \( x = 15m + 7 \) for some integer \( m \).

3. **Set the two expressions equal**:
   - \( 6k + 5 = 15m + 7 \).

4. **Solve for \( k \) and \( m \)**:
   - Rearrange to \( 6k - 15m = 2 \).
   - Simplify to \( 2k - 5m = \frac{2}{3} \).

5. **Identify the contradiction**:
   - The equation \( 2k - 5m = \frac{2}{3} \) is impossible because \( k \) and \( m \) are integers, and the right-hand side is not an integer.

6. **Conclusion**: Since the system leads to a contradiction, no such \( x \) exists. Therefore, the system has no solution.
