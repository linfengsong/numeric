### Part (a)
**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
```lean4
theorem part_a (N : ℕ) : 9 ∣ (N - reverse N) := by
  have h₁ : N - reverse N = 9 * (N / 10 - reverse N / 10) := by
    sorry
  have h₂ : 9 ∣ (N - reverse N) := by
    sorry
  exact h₂
```

**Explanation:**
1. We first express \( N - \text{reverse}(N) \) as a multiple of 9.
2. Since \( 9 \mid 9 \cdot k \) for any integer \( k \), the result follows.

### Part (b)
**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
```lean4
theorem part_b (n : ℕ) (h : IsPalindrome n) (h_even : Even (Nat.log 10 n)) : 11 ∣ n := by
  have h₁ : 11 ∣ n := by
    sorry
  exact h₁
```

**Explanation:**
1. We use the property that a palindrome with an even number of digits is divisible by 11.
2. The proof leverages the fact that the alternating sum of the digits of a palindrome is divisible by 11.

    -- Use the property of palindromes and the given even number of digits to show divisibility by 11.
    -- This involves using the fact that the alternating sum of the digits of a palindrome is divisible by 11.
    -- The detailed proof is omitted here for brevity, but it involves using the properties of palindromes and modular arithmetic.
    -- For the purpose of this example, we assume the result is true based on the properties of palindromes and modular arithmetic.
