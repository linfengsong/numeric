### Explanation

1. **Initial Setup**: We start by providing a specific solution for \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \). We choose \( n = 0 \), \( k = 0 \), and \( m = 0 \).

2. **Verification**:
   - For \( n = 0 \), \( n^2 = 0 \), which divides any integer \( k \). Thus, \( 0^2 \mid 0 \) is trivially true.
   - For \( n + 1 = 1 \), \( (n + 1)^2 = 1 \), which divides any integer \( k + 1 \). Thus, \( 1^2 \mid 1 \) is trivially true.
   - For \( n + 2 = 2 \), \( (n + 2)^2 = 4 \), and we need \( 4 \mid k + 2 \). We choose \( k = 0 \), so \( k + 2 = 2 \), and \( 4 \nmid 2 \). This seems incorrect at first glance. However, the problem is to find three consecutive integers where each is divisible by a square. The initial choice \( n = 0 \) does not work for the third condition.

3. **Revisiting the Solution**:
   - The initial choice \( n = 0 \) does not satisfy the third condition. We need to find a better \( n \). Let's try \( n = 12 \):
     - \( n^2 = 144 \), \( n + 1 = 13 \), \( (n + 1)^2 = 169 \), \( n + 2 = 14 \), \( (n + 2)^2 = 196 \).
     - We need \( 144 \mid k \), \( 169 \mid k + 1 \), and \( 196 \mid k + 2 \).
     - Let's find \( k \) such that all three conditions hold. This is a more involved calculation, but we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find \( k \).

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - After some trial and error, we find that \( n = 0 \) does not work. Instead, we can use \( n = 0 \) and adjust the conditions to ensure divisibility. The Lean4 code provided is a placeholder and does not fully satisfy the conditions. A correct solution would involve finding \( n \) such that the conditions hold.

### Normal Language Proof

To find three consecutive integers each having a square factor:

1. **First Integer**: Let the first integer be \( n \). We need \( n^2 \) to divide \( n \). This is true if \( n = 0 \) or \( n = 1 \).
   - For \( n = 0 \): \( 0^2 \mid 0 \) is true.
   - For \( n = 1 \): \( 1^2 \mid 1 \) is true.

2. **Second Integer**: The next integer is \( n + 1 \). We need \( (n + 1)^2 \) to divide \( n + 1 \). This is true if \( n + 1 = 0 \) or \( n + 1 = 1 \).
   - For \( n = 0 \): \( 1^2 \mid 1 \) is true.
   - For \( n = 1 \): \( 4 \mid 2 \) is false.

3. **Third Integer**: The next integer is \( n + 2 \). We need \( (n + 2)^2 \) to divide \( n + 2 \). This is true if \( n + 2 = 0 \) or \( n + 2 = 1 \).
   - For \( n = 0 \): \( 4 \mid 2 \) is false.
   - For \( n = 1 \): \( 9 \mid 3 \) is false.

Thus, \( n = 0 \) does not work. Let's try \( n = 12 \):

1. **First Integer**: \( 12^2 \mid 12 \) is false.
2. **Second Integer**: \( 13^2 \mid 13 \) is false.
3. **Third Integer**: \( 14^2 \mid 14 \) is false.

This approach is not straightforward. A better solution is to use \( n = 0 \) and adjust the conditions to ensure divisibility. The Lean4 code provided is a placeholder and does not fully satisfy the conditions. A correct solution would involve finding \( n \) such that the conditions hold.

### Correct Lean4 Proof

theorem three_consecutive_integers_with_square_factors : ∃ n : ℕ, ∃ k : ℕ, ∃ m : ℕ, 
  n^2 ∣ k ∧ (n + 1)^2 ∣ (k + 1) ∧ (n + 2)^2 ∣ (k + 2) := by

```

### Explanation

The Lean4 code provided is a placeholder and does not fully satisfy the conditions. A correct solution would involve finding \( n \) such that the conditions hold. The `use` statements are placeholders, and the `simp` and `norm_num` tactics are used to simplify and verify the conditions. However, the initial choice \( n = 0 \) does not work for the third condition. A correct solution would require a more sophisticated approach, possibly using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or other number-theoretic tools.
