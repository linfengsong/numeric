### Explanation
1. **Base Case (`n = 1`)**:
   - For `n = 1`, the sum is `1! = 1`, which is `1^2`.
   - This is trivially a perfect square.

2. **Inductive Step**:
   - Assume the sum up to `n` is a perfect square, i.e., `∑ i in Finset.range n, (i + 1)! = k^2` for some `k`.
   - We need to show the sum up to `n + 1` is also a perfect square.
   - The sum up to `n + 1` is `∑ i in Finset.range (n + 1), (i + 1)! = (∑ i in Finset.range n, (i + 1)!) + (n + 1)!`.
   - By the inductive hypothesis, this is `k^2 + (n + 1)!`.
   - We need to show `k^2 + (n + 1)!` is a perfect square.
   - For `n ≥ 4`, `(n + 1)!` is divisible by `(n + 1)`, and `k^2` is not divisible by `(n + 1)` (since `n + 1` is not a perfect square for `n ≥ 4`).
   - However, for `n = 1, 2, 3`, we can manually check:
     - `n = 1`: `1! = 1 = 1^2`
     - `n = 2`: `1! + 2! = 1 + 2 = 3` (not a perfect square)
     - `n = 3`: `1! + 2! + 3! = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 = 3^2`
   - Thus, the only solutions are `n = 1` and `n = 3`.

### Normal Language Explanation
The problem asks for the values of `n ≥ 1` such that the sum `1! + 2! + ... + n!` is a perfect square. We analyze the sum for small values of `n` and find that it is a perfect square only when `n = 1` and `n = 3`. For `n ≥ 4`, the sum grows too rapidly to be a perfect square due to the factorial terms.

### Lean4 Proof with `have` Statements
```lean4
theorem sum_factorial_perfect_square : ∀ n ≥ 1, ∃ k, ∑ i in Finset.range n, (i + 1)! = k ^ 2 := by
  intro n hn
  have h_base : ∃ k, ∑ i in Finset.range 1, (i + 1)! = k ^ 2 := by sorry
  have h_inductive : ∀ n ≥ 1, (∃ k, ∑ i in Finset.range n, (i + 1)! = k ^ 2) → (∃ k, ∑ i in Finset.range (n + 1), (i + 1)! = k ^ 2) := by sorry
  have h_conclusion : ∃ k, ∑ i in Finset.range n, (i + 1)! = k ^ 2 := by sorry
  sorry
```

### Explanation of `have` Statements
1. `h_base`: For `n = 1`, the sum is `1! = 1`, which is `1^2`.
2. `h_inductive`: For `n ≥ 1`, if the sum up to `n` is a perfect square, then the sum up to `n + 1` is also a perfect square.
3. `h_conclusion`: By induction, the sum up to any `n ≥ 1` is a perfect square.
