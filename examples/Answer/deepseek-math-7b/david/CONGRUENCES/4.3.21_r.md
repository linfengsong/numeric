theorem repunit_factorization : 111111 = 3 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 37 := by
  norm_num
  <;> rfl
  <;> simp_all
  <;> norm_num
  <;> rfl
```

### Explanation
1. **`norm_num`**: This tactic is used to perform numerical normalization, which simplifies the expression `111111` to its prime factorization form.
2. **`rfl`**: This tactic is used to confirm that the simplified form matches the expected product of primes: `3 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 37`.
3. **`simp_all`**: This tactic is used to simplify all goals, but in this case, it is not necessary as the proof is straightforward after `norm_num`.
4. **`norm_num` and `rfl`**: These are repeated to ensure that the numerical simplification is correct and that the final form matches the expected result.

### Normal Language Explanation
The repunit \( R_6 \) is the six-digit number 111111. To factorize it into primes, we can proceed as follows:
1. **Check divisibility by small primes**:
   - 111111 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - The sum of its digits (1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6) is divisible by 3, so 111111 is divisible by 3.
   - Dividing 111111 by 3 gives 37037.
   - 37037 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - The sum of its digits (3+7+0+3+7 = 20) is not divisible by 3, so it is not divisible by 3.
   - Check divisibility by 5: The last digit is 7, so it is not divisible by 5.
   - Check divisibility by 7: Perform the division 37037 ÷ 7 ≈ 5291. This is an integer, so 111111 = 3 × 7 × 5291.
   - Now, factor 5291. Check divisibility by small primes:
     - 5291 is odd, so not divisible by 2.
     - Sum of digits: 5+2+9+1 = 17, not divisible by 3.
     - Does not end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.
     - Perform division 5291 ÷ 7 ≈ 755.857, not an integer.
     - Perform division 5291 ÷ 11 ≈ 481, which is an integer. So, 5291 = 11 × 481.
   - Now, factor 481. Check divisibility by small primes:
     - 481 is odd, so not divisible by 2.
     - Sum of digits: 4+8+1 = 13, not divisible by 3.
     - Does not end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.
     - Perform division 481 ÷ 7 ≈ 68.714, not an integer.
     - Perform division 481 ÷ 11 ≈ 43.727, not an integer.
     - Perform division 481 ÷ 13 ≈ 37, which is an integer. So, 481 = 13 × 37.
   - Thus, the complete factorization is 111111 = 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 37.

### Final Answer
\[ \boxed{3 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 37} \]
