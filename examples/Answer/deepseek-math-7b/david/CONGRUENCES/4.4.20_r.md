### (a) System of Congruences:

**Lean4 Code:**
```lean4
theorem part_a : ∀ x y : ℕ, 5 * x + 3 * y ≡ 1 [MOD 7] ∧ 3 * x + 2 * y ≡ 4 [MOD 7] → x ≡ 3 [MOD 7] ∧ y ≡ 5 [MOD 7] := by
  intro x y h
  have h₁ := h.1
  have h₂ := h.2
  simp only [Nat.ModEq, Nat.ModEq] at h₁ h₂ ⊢
  -- We need to find x and y modulo 7 that satisfy both equations.
  -- We will use the fact that the system is linear and can be solved using basic arithmetic operations.
  have : x % 7 = 3 ∧ y % 7 = 5 := by
    -- We will use the fact that the system is linear and can be solved using basic arithmetic operations.
    have : x % 7 = 3 := by
      -- We will use the fact that the system is linear and can be solved using basic arithmetic operations.
      omega
    have : y % 7 = 5 := by
      -- We will use the fact that the system is linear and can be solved using basic arithmetic operations.
      omega
    exact ⟨by omega, by omega⟩
  exact this
```

**Normal Language:**
1. We start by assuming the given system of congruences:
   - \(5x + 3y \equiv 1 \mod 7\)
   - \(3x + 2y \equiv 4 \mod 7\)
2. We need to find \(x\) and \(y\) modulo 7 that satisfy both equations.
3. We use the fact that the system is linear and can be solved using basic arithmetic operations.
4. We find that \(x \equiv 3 \mod 7\) and \(y \equiv 5 \mod 7\) is the unique solution.

**Lean4 Code:**
```lean4

  intro x y h
  have h₁ := h.1
  have h₂ := h.2
  simp only [Nat.ModEq, Nat.ModEq] at h₁ h₂ ⊢
  -- We need to find x and y modulo 11 that satisfy both equations.

**Normal Language:**

### (c) System of Congruences:

```lean4
