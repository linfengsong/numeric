```

### Explanation

1. **Prime Divisibility Lemma**: The key idea is to use the fact that a prime \( p \) divides the binomial coefficient \( \binom{2n}{n} \) if \( p \) is a prime such that \( n < p < 2n \). This is a direct application of a lemma that states that for a prime \( p \) in the range \( n < p < 2n \), \( p \) divides \( \binom{2n}{n} \).

2. **Modulo Zero**: Since \( p \) divides \( \binom{2n}{n} \), it follows that \( \binom{2n}{n} \mod p = 0 \).

3. **Lean4 Proof**: The Lean4 proof uses the `dvd_choose_pow` lemma to show that \( p \) divides \( \binom{2n}{n} \), and then uses the fact that if a number is divisible by another, its modulo is zero.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **Range of \( p \)**: Given \( p \) is a prime such that \( n < p < 2n \), we know that \( p \) is a prime that lies strictly between \( n \) and \( 2n \).

2. **Binomial Coefficient Property**: The binomial coefficient \( \binom{2n}{n} \) counts the number of ways to choose \( n \) elements from a set of \( 2n \) elements. For a prime \( p \) in the range \( n < p < 2n \), \( p \) must divide \( \binom{2n}{n} \) because \( p \) cannot be avoided in the numerator when expanding \( \binom{2n}{n} \) in terms of factorials.

3. **Modulo Zero**: Since \( p \) divides \( \binom{2n}{n} \), it follows that \( \binom{2n}{n} \mod p = 0 \). This is a direct consequence of the definition of divisibility and modulo operation.

### Conclusion

The Lean4 proof leverages the prime divisibility lemma to show that \( p \) divides \( \binom{2n}{n} \), and the modulo operation confirms that the binomial coefficient is zero modulo \( p \). The normal language explanation provides a deeper intuition into why this result holds.
