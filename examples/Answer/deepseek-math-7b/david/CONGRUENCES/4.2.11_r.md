### Explanation

1. **First Part (`h₁`):**
   - We need to show that for every `a` less than 11, there exists a `b` less than 11 such that `a ≡ b [MOD 11]`.
   - This is straightforward because `a` itself is a valid `b` since `a < 11` implies `a ≡ a [MOD 11]`.

2. **Second Part (`h₂`):**
   - We need to show that the squares of numbers `0` to `10` modulo 11 do not cover all residues `0` to `10`.
   - We check the squares of `3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10` modulo 11 and find that they do not cover all residues. For example:
     - `3² ≡ 9 [MOD 11]`
     - `5² ≡ 3 [MOD 11]`
     - `6² ≡ 3 [MOD 11]`
     - `7² ≡ 5 [MOD 11]`
     - `8² ≡ 6 [MOD 11]`
     - `9² ≡ 4 [MOD 11]`
     - `10² ≡ 1 [MOD 11]`
   - This shows that the squares do not cover all residues modulo 11.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **Complete Set of Residues for `a`:**
   - For each `a` from `0` to `10`, we can directly use `a` as the corresponding residue since `a < 11` implies `a ≡ a [MOD 11]`.

2. **Incomplete Set of Residues for `a²`:**
   - We compute the squares of `0` to `10` modulo 11 and observe that the resulting residues are not all distinct. Specifically, the squares `3², 5², 6², 7², 8², 9², 10²` modulo 11 cover only the residues `3, 5, 6, 9, 4, 1, 10` (in some order), missing `0, 2, 7, 8`. This shows that the set of squares is not complete.
