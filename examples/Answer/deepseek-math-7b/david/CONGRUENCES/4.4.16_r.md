```

### Explanation

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find a natural number \( k \) such that \( t_1^2 + t_2^2 + \ldots + t_n^2 = k \cdot t_n \).
   - \( t_n \) is the \( n \)-th triangular number, defined as \( t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

2. **Proof Sketch**:
   - We will use mathematical induction on \( n \) to prove that \( t_n \) divides \( t_1^2 + t_2^2 + \ldots + t_n^2 \).
   - Base case (\( n = 0 \)): \( t_0 = 0 \), and \( t_1^2 + \ldots + t_0^2 = 0 \), so \( 0 \) divides \( 0 \).
   - Inductive step: Assume the statement holds for \( n \), i.e., \( t_n \) divides \( t_1^2 + \ldots + t_n^2 \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).

3. **Lean4 Proof Structure**:
   - We use `induction` on \( n \) to handle the base case and inductive step.
   - For the inductive step, we simplify the expressions and use `omega` to solve the divisibility condition.

4. **Lean4 Code**:
   - The `have h` statement asserts that \( t_n \) divides \( t_1^2 + \ldots + t_n^2 \).
   - The `exact?` tactic is used to automatically solve the goal by applying the `divides` property.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **Base Case (\( n = 0 \))**:
   - \( t_0 = 0 \).
   - \( t_1^2 + \ldots + t_0^2 = 0 \).
   - \( 0 \) divides \( 0 \), so the statement holds.

2. **Inductive Step**:
   - Assume \( t_n \) divides \( t_1^2 + \ldots + t_n^2 \).
   - We need to show \( t_{n+1} \) divides \( t_1^2 + \ldots + t_{n+1}^2 \).
   - Simplify the expression for \( t_1^2 + \ldots + t_{n+1}^2 \) and use the inductive hypothesis to show divisibility.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - By induction, the statement holds for all \( n \).

### Final Answer

The Lean4 proof is complete, and the statement is true for all \( n \). The Lean4 code and the normal language explanation align, confirming the divisibility condition.
