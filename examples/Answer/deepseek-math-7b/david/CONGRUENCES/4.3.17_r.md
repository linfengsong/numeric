**Normal Language Proof:**
1. **Forward Direction (⇒):**
   - Assume 7, 11, and 13 divide \( N \).
   - Use the properties of divisibility and modular arithmetic to show that \( M \) is congruent to \( N \) modulo 7, 11, and 13.
   - Since \( N \) is divisible by 7, 11, and 13, \( M \) must also be divisible by these numbers.

2. **Reverse Direction (⇐):**
   - Assume 7, 11, and 13 divide \( M \).
   - Use the properties of divisibility and modular arithmetic to show that \( N \) is congruent to \( M \) modulo 7, 11, and 13.
   - Since \( M \) is divisible by 7, 11, and 13, \( N \) must also be divisible by these numbers.

  have h₁ : N = a_m * 10^m + ... + a_0 := hN

   - Use the properties of divisibility and modular arithmetic to show that \( M \) is congruent to \( N \) modulo 6.
   - Since \( N \) is divisible by 6, \( M \) must also be divisible by 6.
