### Explanation
1. **Divisibility by 9**:
   - The sum of the digits of `176521221` is `1 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 27`, which is divisible by 9.
   - Since the sum of the digits is divisible by 9, the number itself is divisible by 9.

2. **Divisibility by 11**:
   - The alternating sum of the digits of `149235678` is `1 - 4 + 9 - 2 + 3 - 5 + 6 - 7 + 8 = 11`, which is divisible by 11.
   - Since the alternating sum is divisible by 11, the number itself is divisible by 11.

### Lean4 Proof with `norm_num` and `rfl`
The `norm_num` tactic is used to perform numerical normalization, and `rfl` is used to confirm that the remainder is indeed 0, confirming the divisibility.

### Normal Language Explanation
1. **Divisibility by 9**:
   - Calculate the sum of the digits: `1 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 27`.
   - Since `27` is divisible by `9`, the number `176521221` is divisible by `9`.

2. **Divisibility by 11**:
   - Calculate the alternating sum of the digits: `1 - 4 + 9 - 2 + 3 - 5 + 6 - 7 + 8 = 11`.
   - Since `11` is divisible by `11`, the number `149235678` is divisible by `11`.

### Final Answer
Both numbers are divisible by 9 and 11, respectively.
