### Explanation

The proof shows that \(360\) divides \(a^2 (a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)\) by demonstrating that the expression is divisible by \(8\), \(9\), and \(5\) (since \(360 = 8 \times 9 \times 5\)).

1. **Divisibility by 8**:
   - The expression \(a^2 (a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)\) is divisible by 8 for any integer \(a\) because among any three consecutive even or odd integers, one is divisible by 2 and another by 4, ensuring divisibility by 8.

2. **Divisibility by 9**:
   - The expression \(a^2 (a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)\) is divisible by 9 for any integer \(a\) because among any three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3, and the product of three consecutive integers is divisible by 9.

3. **Divisibility by 5**:
   - The expression \(a^2 (a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)\) is divisible by 5 for any integer \(a\) because among any five consecutive integers, one is divisible by 5.

Since the expression is divisible by 8, 9, and 5, and these numbers are pairwise coprime, it is divisible by \(8 \times 9 \times 5 = 360\).
