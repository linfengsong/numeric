### Lean4 Proof

```lean4
theorem gcd_assoc : ∀ a b c : ℤ, gcd a b = 1 → gcd b c = 1 → gcd a c = 1 → gcd (gcd a b) c = gcd a (gcd b c) := by
  intro a b c h₁ h₂ h₃
  simp_all [gcd_eq_zero_iff, gcd_eq_zero_iff]
  <;> aesop
```

### Explanation

1. **Assumptions**: We assume that `gcd(a, b) = 1`, `gcd(b, c) = 1`, and `gcd(a, c) = 1` (these are the hypotheses `h₁`, `h₂`, and `h₃`).
2. **Simplification**: We simplify the goal using the properties of `gcd` and the given hypotheses. The `simp_all` tactic simplifies the goal using the given hypotheses and properties of `gcd`.
3. **Aesop**: Aesop is a tactic that automatically solves the goal by applying known lemmas and rules. In this case, it uses the properties of `gcd` and the given hypotheses to conclude the proof.

### Normal Language Explanation

The proof leverages the associativity of `gcd` for three integers, given that any two of them are coprime. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Given**: `gcd(a, b) = 1`, `gcd(b, c) = 1`, and `gcd(a, c) = 1`.
2. **Goal**: Show that `gcd(gcd(a, b), c) = gcd(a, gcd(b, c))`.
3. **Key Insight**: The `gcd` operation is associative under the given conditions. This is because `gcd(a, b, c)` is the largest integer that divides all three, and since any two of `a`, `b`, and `c` are coprime, the `gcd` of any two is 1, which simplifies the associativity.
4. **Proof**:
   - `gcd(a, b, c)` is the largest integer dividing all three.
   - By the properties of `gcd`, `gcd(gcd(a, b), c)` is the largest integer dividing both `gcd(a, b)` and `c`.
   - Similarly, `gcd(a, gcd(b, c))` is the largest integer dividing both `a` and `gcd(b, c)`.
   - Since `gcd(a, b) = 1`, `gcd(a, b, c)` is the same as `gcd(a, c)`, and similarly for the other expressions.
   - The associativity follows from the fact that the `gcd` of any two is 1, simplifying the structure.

### Final Answer

The Lean4 proof is complete, and the normal language explanation justifies the associativity of `gcd` under the given conditions. The key insight is that the `gcd` of three integers, where any two are coprime, is associative due to the properties of `gcd` and the given hypotheses.
