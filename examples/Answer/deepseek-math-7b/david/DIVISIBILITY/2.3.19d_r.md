### Explanation

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to show that if an integer `a` is not divisible by 2 or 3, then `24` divides `a² + 23`.
2. **Key Insight**: Since `a` is not divisible by 2 or 3, `a` must be odd and not divisible by 3. The possible residues of `a` modulo 24 are limited because `a` is not divisible by 2 or 3.
3. **Residues Modulo 24**: The possible residues of `a` modulo 24 are those not divisible by 2 or 3. These are `1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23`.
4. **Compute `a² + 23` Modulo 24**: For each residue, compute `a² + 23` modulo 24 and verify that it is 0.
   - For `a ≡ 1 mod 24`: `1² + 23 ≡ 1 + 23 ≡ 24 ≡ 0 mod 24`
   - For `a ≡ 5 mod 24`: `5² + 23 ≡ 25 + 23 ≡ 48 ≡ 0 mod 24`
   - Similarly for the other residues, `a² + 23 ≡ 0 mod 24`.
5. **Conclusion**: Since `a² + 23 ≡ 0 mod 24` for all residues, `24` divides `a² + 23`.

### Lean4 Proof Breakdown

The Lean4 proof uses the fact that `a` is not divisible by 2 or 3 to deduce that `a % 24` must be one of the specific residues. Then, it computes `a² + 23` modulo 24 for each of these residues and shows that the result is 0. The `omega` tactic is used to handle the arithmetic and modular arithmetic simplifications.

### Normal Language Proof

1. **Residues of `a` Modulo 24**:
   - Since `a` is not divisible by 2 or 3, `a` is odd and not divisible by 3. Thus, `a % 24` can only be one of the following:
     - 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.
2. **Compute `a² + 23` Modulo 24**:
   - For each residue, compute `a² + 23` modulo 24:
     - If `a ≡ 1 mod 24`, then `a² ≡ 1 mod 24` and `a² + 23 ≡ 0 mod 24`.
     - Similarly for the other residues, `a² + 23 ≡ 0 mod 24`.
3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `a² + 23 ≡ 0 mod 24` for all residues, `24` divides `a² + 23`.

### Final Answer

The Lean4 proof is complete, and the normal language proof confirms the result. The key insight is that the possible residues of `a` modulo 24 are limited, and for each residue, `a² + 23` is divisible by 24.
