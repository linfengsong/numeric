### Explanation
1. **Modular Arithmetic Setup**:
   - We use the fact that for any natural number `n`, `n % 2` is either 0 or 1.
   - This is because any integer modulo 2 can only be 0 or 1.

2. **Analyze `(n + 1)^3 % 2`**:
   - If `n % 2 = 0`, then `(n + 1) % 2 = 1`, and `(n + 1)^3 % 2 = 1^3 % 2 = 1`.
   - If `n % 2 = 1`, then `(n + 1) % 2 = 0`, and `(n + 1)^3 % 2 = 0^3 % 2 = 0`.
   - Thus, `(n + 1)^3 % 2 = (n + 1) % 2`.

3. **Analyze `n^3 % 2`**:
   - Similarly, if `n % 2 = 0`, then `n^3 % 2 = 0^3 % 2 = 0`.
   - If `n % 2 = 1`, then `n^3 % 2 = 1^3 % 2 = 1`.
   - Thus, `n^3 % 2 = n % 2`.

4. **Combine Results**:
   - The difference `(n + 1)^3 - n^3` modulo 2 is `((n + 1) % 2) - (n % 2)`.
   - This simplifies to `1 - 0 = 1` or `0 - 1 = -1`, but since we are working modulo 2, `-1 ≡ 1`.
   - Thus, the difference is always `1 % 2 = 1`, meaning it is never divisible by 2.

### Normal Language Explanation
The difference of two consecutive cubes, `(n + 1)^3 - n^3`, can be simplified to `3n^2 + 3n + 1`. We need to show that this expression is never divisible by 2 for any natural number `n`.

1. **Parity of `n`**:
   - Consider `n` modulo 2. `n` can be either even or odd.
   - If `n` is even, then `n = 2k` for some integer `k`, and the expression becomes `3(2k)^2 + 3(2k) + 1 = 12k^2 + 6k + 1`, which is odd.
   - If `n` is odd, then `n = 2k + 1` for some integer `k`, and the expression becomes `3(2k + 1)^2 + 3(2k + 1) + 1 = 12k^2 + 18k + 7`, which is also odd.

2. **Conclusion**:
   - In both cases, the difference is odd, and no odd number is divisible by 2.
   - Therefore, the difference of two consecutive cubes is never divisible by 2.
