### Explanation

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to prove that the sum of the reciprocals of the first `n` triangular numbers is less than 2.
   - The `i`-th triangular number is given by `t_i = i * (i + 1) / 2`.
   - The reciprocals are `1 / t_i = 1 / (i * (i + 1) / 2)`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For `i ≥ 1`, `i * (i + 1) / 2 ≥ 1`, so `1 / (i * (i + 1) / 2) = 0` because the denominator is larger than the numerator.
   - The only exception is `i = 0`, where `t_0 = 0` and `1 / t_0` is undefined (or infinite in some contexts). However, in Lean, `1 / 0 = 0` by definition, so the sum starts with `0` for `i = 0`.

3. **Proof Sketch**:
   - We show that for all `i < n`, `1 / (i * (i + 1) / 2) = 0` because the denominator is at least 1 and the numerator is 1.
   - The sum of zeros is zero, and thus the sum is `< 2`.

4. **Lean4 Proof Steps**:
   - We first prove that for all `i < n`, `1 / (i * (i + 1) / 2) = 0`.
   - This is done by considering two cases: `i = 0` and `i ≥ 1`.
   - For `i = 0`, `1 / (0 * (0 + 1) / 2) = 1 / 0 = 0` (Lean's definition).
   - For `i ≥ 1`, `i * (i + 1) / 2 ≥ 1`, so `1 / (i * (i + 1) / 2) = 0` because the denominator is larger than the numerator.
   - The sum of all these zeros is zero, which is `< 2`.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The sum of the reciprocals of the first `n` triangular numbers is less than 2.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **Triangular Numbers**:
   - The `i`-th triangular number is `t_i = i * (i + 1) / 2`.
   - For example:
     - `t_0 = 0`
     - `t_1 = 1 * 2 / 2 = 1`
     - `t_2 = 2 * 3 / 2 = 3`
     - `t_3 = 3 * 4 / 2 = 6`
     - etc.

2. **Reciprocal Sum**:
   - The sum of the reciprocals is `S = 1/1 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/10 + ... + 1/t_n`.

3. **Proof Idea**:
   - For `i ≥ 1`, `t_i ≥ 1`, so `1 / t_i ≤ 1` (but actually `1 / t_i = 0` because `t_i ≥ 1`).
   - The only exception is `i = 0`, where `t_0 = 0` and `1 / t_0 = 0` in Lean.
   - Thus, the sum is `0 + 0 + ... + 0 = 0 < 2`.

4. **Lean4 Implementation**:
   - We use the fact that for `i ≥ 1`, `i * (i + 1) / 2 ≥ 1`, so `1 / (i * (i + 1) / 2) = 0`.
   - The sum is then a sum of zeros, which is zero.

### Final Answer

The sum of the reciprocals of the first `n` triangular numbers is less than 2.
