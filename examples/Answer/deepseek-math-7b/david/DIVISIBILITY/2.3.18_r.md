### Explanation
1. **Theorem Statement**: We aim to prove that the product of any three consecutive integers is divisible by 6.
2. **Proof Sketch**:
   - Consider any integer \( n \). The product \( n(n+1)(n+2) \) is the product of three consecutive integers.
   - Among any three consecutive integers, at least one is divisible by 2 and at least one is divisible by 3.
   - Thus, the product is divisible by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \).
3. **Lean4 Proof**:
   - We use the fact that for any \( n \), the product \( n(n+1)(n+2) \) modulo 6 is 0.
   - We consider all possible remainders of \( n \) when divided by 6 (0 through 5) and show that in each case, the product is divisible by 6.
   - This is done by checking each case and using properties of modular arithmetic.

### Normal Language Proof
1. **Divisibility by 2**:
   - Among any three consecutive integers, one is even (divisible by 2).
   - Thus, the product is divisible by 2.
2. **Divisibility by 3**:
   - Among any three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3.
   - Thus, the product is divisible by 3.
3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the product is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \).

### Explanation
1. **Theorem Statement**: We aim to prove that the product of any four consecutive integers is divisible by 24.
2. **Proof Sketch**:
   - Consider any integer \( n \). The product \( n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) \) is the product of four consecutive integers.
   - Among any four consecutive integers:
     - One is divisible by 2.
     - One is divisible by 3.
     - One is divisible by 4 (since every four consecutive integers include a multiple of 4).
   - Thus, the product is divisible by \( 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24 \).
3. **Lean4 Proof**:
   - We use the fact that for any \( n \), the product \( n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) \) modulo 24 is 0.
   - We consider all possible remainders of \( n \) when divided by 24 and show that in each case, the product is divisible by 24.

### Normal Language Proof
1. **Divisibility by 4**:
   - Among any four consecutive integers, one is divisible by 4.
   - Thus, the product is divisible by 4.
2. **Divisibility by 3**:
   - Among any four consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3.
   - Thus, the product is divisible by 3.
3. **Divisibility by 2**:
   - Among any four consecutive integers, two are even (divisible by 2).
   - Thus, the product is divisible by 2.
4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the product is divisible by 2, 3, and 4, it is divisible by \( 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24 \).
