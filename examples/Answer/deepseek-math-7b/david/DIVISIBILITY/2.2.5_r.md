```

### Explanation
1. **Existence of Integer \( k \)**:
   - We claim that \( k = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \) is an integer.
   - This is because \( n(n+1)(2n+1) \) is always divisible by 6 for any natural number \( n \).

2. **Proof of Divisibility**:
   - For any \( n \geq 1 \), \( n(n+1)(2n+1) \) is the product of three consecutive integers.
   - Among any three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 2, and one is divisible by 3.
   - Thus, \( n(n+1)(2n+1) \) is divisible by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \).

3. **Lean4 Implementation**:
   - We use the `use` tactic to provide the integer \( k \) as the expression \( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \).
   - The `simp` tactic simplifies the expression, and `norm_cast` ensures the cast to integers is correct.
   - `ring_nf` normalizes the expression, and `norm_cast` ensures the cast is correct.
   - `omega` is used to confirm the divisibility condition.

### Normal Language Proof

**Theorem**: For \( n \geq 1 \), \( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \) is an integer.

**Proof**:
1. **Divisibility by 2**:
   - Among any three consecutive integers \( n, n+1, 2n+1 \), one is even. Thus, \( n(n+1)(2n+1) \) is divisible by 2.

2. **Divisibility by 3**:
   - Among any three consecutive integers \( n, n+1, 2n+1 \), one is divisible by 3. Thus, \( n(n+1)(2n+1) \) is divisible by 3.

3. **Combined Divisibility by 6**:
   - Since \( n(n+1)(2n+1) \) is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The quotient \( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \) is an integer because the numerator is divisible by 6.

### Lean4 Proof with `have` Statements
```lean4
theorem n_times_n_plus_1_times_2n_plus_1_div_6_is_integer (n : ℕ) : 
    ∃ k : ℤ, n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6 = k := by
  have h_div_2 : 2 ∣ n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) := by sorry
  have h_div_3 : 3 ∣ n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) := by sorry
  have h_div_6 : 6 ∣ n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) := by sorry
  have h_main : ∃ k : ℤ, n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6 = k := by sorry
  sorry
```

### Explanation of `have` Statements:
1. `h_div_2`: The product \( n(n+1)(2n+1) \) is divisible by 2.
2. `h_div_3`: The product \( n(n+1)(2n+1) \) is divisible by 3.
3. `h_div_6`: The product \( n(n+1)(2n+1) \) is divisible by 6.
4. `h_main`: The quotient \( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \) is an integer because the numerator is divisible by 6.

Each `have` statement corresponds to a key step in the proof, and the final `sorry` is unnecessary since `h_main` directly implies the goal.
