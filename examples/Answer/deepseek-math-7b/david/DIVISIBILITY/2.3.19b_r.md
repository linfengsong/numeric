### Explanation

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to show that for any odd integer `a`, `24` divides `a(a² - 1)`.
   - This is equivalent to showing that `a(a² - 1) % 24 = 0`.

2. **Approach**:
   - We will use modular arithmetic to show that `a(a² - 1)` is divisible by `24` by checking divisibility by `3` and `8` (since `24 = 3 * 8` and `gcd(3, 8) = 1`).

3. **Proof**:
   - **Divisibility by 3**:
     - If `a` is odd, then `a ≡ 1` or `2 mod 3`.
     - If `a ≡ 1 mod 3`, then `a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3`.
     - If `a ≡ 2 mod 3`, then `a² ≡ 1 mod 3`, so `a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3`.
     - Thus, `a(a² - 1) ≡ 0 mod 3` in all cases.
   - **Divisibility by 8**:
     - Since `a` is odd, `a² ≡ 1 mod 8` (as shown in `h2`).
     - Thus, `a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 8`, so `a(a² - 1) ≡ 0 mod 8`.
   - **Combining Results**:
     - Since `a(a² - 1)` is divisible by both `3` and `8`, and `gcd(3, 8) = 1`, it is divisible by `24`.

4. **Lean4 Proof Sketch**:
   - We use `have` statements to break down the proof into smaller modular arithmetic checks.
   - `h1` is the given condition that `a` is odd (i.e., `a % 2 = 1`).
   - `h2` shows that `a² ≡ 1 mod 8` for odd `a`.
   - `h3` combines these to show that `a(a² - 1) ≡ 0 mod 24`.
   - The final result follows from `h3`.

### Normal Language Proof

1. **Divisibility by 3**:
   - Since `a` is odd, `a ≡ 1` or `2 mod 3`.
   - If `a ≡ 1 mod 3`, then `a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3`.
   - If `a ≡ 2 mod 3`, then `a² ≡ 1 mod 3`, so `a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3`.
   - Thus, `a(a² - 1) ≡ 0 mod 3` in all cases.

2. **Divisibility by 8**:
   - Since `a` is odd, `a² ≡ 1 mod 8`.
   - Thus, `a² - 1 ≡ 0 mod 8`, so `a(a² - 1) ≡ 0 mod 8`.

3. **Combining Results**:
   - `a(a² - 1)` is divisible by both `3` and `8`, and since `gcd(3, 8) = 1`, it is divisible by `24`.

### Final Answer

The Lean4 proof is complete, and the normal language proof confirms the result. The key steps are:
- Show `a² ≡ 1 mod 8` for odd `a`.
- Use this to show `a(a² - 1) ≡ 0 mod 8`.
- Show `a(a² - 1) ≡ 0 mod 3` by cases on `a mod 3`.
- Combine these to conclude `a(a² - 1) ≡ 0 mod 24`.
