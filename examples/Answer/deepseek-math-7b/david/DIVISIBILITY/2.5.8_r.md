### (a) Alcuin of York, 775. One hundred bushels of grain are distributed among 100 persons in such a way that each man receives 3 bushels, each woman 2 bushels, and each child $\frac{1}{2}$ bushel. How many men, women, and children are there?

**Lean4 Code:**
```lean4
theorem alcuin_of_york : ∃ m w c : ℕ, m + w + c = 100 ∧ 3 * m + 2 * w + 1 / 2 * c = 100 := by
  /-
  To solve the problem, we need to find the number of men (m), women (w), and children (c) such that:
  1. The total number of people is 100: m + w + c = 100.
  2. The total amount of grain is 100 bushels, distributed as 3 bushels per man, 2 bushels per woman, and 0.5 bushels per child: 3m + 2w + 0.5c = 100.
  
  We start by expressing c in terms of m and w from the first equation:
  c = 100 - m - w.
  
  Substitute c into the second equation:
  3m + 2w + 0.5(100 - m - w) = 100.
  
  Simplify the equation:
  3m + 2w + 50 - 0.5m - 0.5w = 100.
  2.5m + 1.5w + 50 = 100.
  2.5m + 1.5w = 50.
  
  Multiply through by 2 to eliminate decimals:
  5m + 3w = 100.
  
  Now, we solve for m in terms of w:
  m = (100 - 3w) / 5.
  
  For m to be an integer, 100 - 3w must be divisible by 5. We test values of w that satisfy this condition:
  - w = 0: m = 100 / 5 = 20 (valid).
  - w = 5: m = (100 - 15) / 5 = 85 / 5 = 17 (valid).
  - w = 10: m = (100 - 30) / 5 = 70 / 5 = 14 (valid).
  - w = 15: m = (100 - 45) / 5 = 55 / 5 = 11 (valid).
  - w = 20: m = (100 - 60) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8 (valid).
  - w = 25: m = (100 - 75) / 5 = 25 / 5 = 5 (valid).
  - w = 30: m = (100 - 90) / 5 = 10 / 5 = 2 (valid).
  - w = 35: m = (100 - 105) / 5 = -5 / 5 = -1 (invalid, m must be non-negative).
  
  Thus, the valid pairs (m, w) are:
  (20, 0), (17, 5), (14, 10), (11, 15), (8, 20), (5, 25), (2, 30).
  
  For each valid pair, we find the corresponding c:
  c = 100 - m - w.
  
  Let's verify one solution, say (m, w, c) = (20, 0, 80):
  - m + w + c = 20 + 0 + 80 = 100.
  - 3m + 2w + 0.5c = 3*20 + 2*0 + 0.5*80 = 60 + 0 + 40 = 100.
  
  This solution satisfies both equations. Similarly, all other valid pairs can be verified to satisfy the conditions.

**Normal Language Solution:**
We need to find integers \( m \), \( w \), and \( c \) such that:
1. \( m + w + c = 100 \)
2. \( 3m + 2w + 0.5c = 100 \)

From the first equation, we can express \( c \) in terms of \( m \) and \( w \):
\[ c = 100 - m - w \]

Substitute \( c \) into the second equation:
\[ 3m + 2w + 0.5(100 - m - w) = 100 \]
\[ 3m + 2w + 50 - 0.5m - 0.5w = 100 \]
\[ 2.5m + 1.5w + 50 = 100 \]
\[ 2.5m + 1.5w = 50 \]
Multiply through by 2 to eliminate decimals:
\[ 5m + 3w = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( m \) in terms of \( w \):
\[ m = \frac{100 - 3w}{5} \]

For \( m \) to be an integer, \( 100 - 3w \) must be divisible by 5. Test values of \( w \) that satisfy this condition:
- \( w = 0 \): \( m = 20 \)
- \( w = 5 \): \( m = 17 \)
- \( w = 10 \): \( m = 14 \)
- \( w = 15 \): \( m = 11 \)
- \( w = 20 \): \( m = 8 \)
- \( w = 25 \): \( m = 5 \)
- \( w = 30 \): \( m = 2 \)
- \( w = 35 \): \( m = -1 \) (invalid)

Thus, the valid pairs \((m, w)\) are:
- \((20, 0)\)
- \((17, 5)\)
- \((14, 10)\)
- \((11, 15)\)
- \((8, 20)\)
- \((5, 25)\)
- \((2, 30)\)

For each valid pair, compute \( c \):
\[ c = 100 - m - w \]

For example, for \((m, w) = (20, 0)\):
\[ c = 100 - 20 - 0 = 80 \]

Verify the solution \((m, w, c) = (20, 0, 80)\):
1. \( 20 + 0 + 80 = 100 \)
2. \( 3 \times 20 + 2 \times 0 + 0.5 \times 80 = 60 + 0 + 40 = 100 \)

All other valid pairs can be verified similarly.

### (b) Mahaviracarya, 850. There were 63 equal piles of plantain fruit put together and 7 single fruits. They were divided evenly among 23 travelers. What is the number of fruits in each pile?

**Lean4 Code:**
```lean4
theorem mahaviracarya : ∃ n : ℕ, 23 * n = 63 * n + 7 := by
  /-
  To solve the problem, we need to find a natural number \( n \) such that:
  \[ 23n = 63n + 7 \]
  
  First, we simplify the equation by subtracting \( 63n \) from both sides:
  \[ 23n - 63n = 7 \]
  \[ -40n = 7 \]
  
  Next, we multiply both sides by -1 to eliminate the negative coefficient:
  \[ 40n = -7 \]
  
  However, this leads to a contradiction because \( n \) must be a natural number and the right-hand side is negative. This suggests that there is no solution in the natural numbers.
  
  Upon re-evaluating the problem, we realize that the correct interpretation should be:
  \[ 23n = 63n + 7 \]
  
  This equation simplifies to:
  \[ 23n
