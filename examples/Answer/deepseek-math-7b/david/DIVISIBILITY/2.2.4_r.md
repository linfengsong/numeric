### Explanation

1. **Assumption and Setup**:
   - We assume for contradiction that there exists an integer `k` such that `k² = 3a² - 1`.
   - We use the fact that any integer `a` can be written as `a = 3q + r` where `r` is the remainder when `a` is divided by 3 (`r ∈ {0, 1, 2}`).
   - Similarly, `k` can be written as `k = 3s + t` where `t ∈ {0, 1, 2}`.

2. **Substitution and Simplification**:
   - Substitute `a = 3q + r` and `k = 3s + t` into the equation `k² = 3a² - 1` and simplify modulo 3.
   - This results in a congruence that must hold for the equation to be true.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - Enumerate all possible values of `r` and `t` (0, 1, 2) and check the corresponding congruence.
   - For each combination, simplify the equation modulo 3 and show that it leads to a contradiction.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since none of the cases yield a solution where `k² ≡ 3a² - 1 (mod 9)`, the original assumption is false.
   - Therefore, `3a² - 1` is never a perfect square.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **Modulo 3 Analysis**:
   - Consider the equation modulo 3. The possible residues for squares modulo 3 are 0 and 1.
   - The right-hand side `3a² - 1` simplifies to `-1 ≡ 2 (mod 3)`.
   - Thus, `k² ≡ 2 (mod 3)` is required, but this is impossible since squares modulo 3 can only be 0 or 1.

2. **Generalization**:
   - For any integer `a`, `3a² - 1` is congruent to 2 modulo 3.
   - No integer square is congruent to 2 modulo 3, hence `3a² - 1` cannot be a perfect square.

### Final Answer

The Lean4 proof systematically checks all possible cases modulo 3, confirming that `3a² - 1` is never a perfect square. The normal language explanation provides a clear modular arithmetic argument.
