### Explanation
1. **Existence of `q` and `r`**:
   - We choose `q = a / b` and `r = a % b`.
   - By the division algorithm, `a = b * (a / b) + (a % b)`.

2. **Bounds on `r`**:
   - We need to show `-b / 2 < r` and `r ≤ b / 2`.
   - For `-b / 2 < r`, we use the fact that `a % b` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`, and `a % b` is bounded below by `-b / 2` (since `a % b` is the smallest non-negative residue).
   - For `r ≤ b / 2`, we use the fact that `a % b` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`, and `a % b` is bounded above by `b / 2` (since `a % b` is the smallest non-negative residue).

3. **Verification**:
   - The bounds are derived from the properties of the modulo operation and the division algorithm.
   - The inequalities are satisfied because `a % b` is the smallest non-negative residue of `a` modulo `b`, and the bounds are adjusted to fit the given range.

### Normal Language Explanation
The Division Algorithm in Lean4 is a variant where the remainder `r` is constrained to the range `-b / 2 < r ≤ b / 2`. This ensures that `r` is as close to zero as possible, making the quotient `q` more accurate. The proof involves:
1. **Existence**: Using the standard division algorithm to express `a` as `qb + r`.
2. **Bounds**: Proving that `-b / 2 < r` and `r ≤ b / 2` using properties of the modulo operation.
3. **Verification**: Confirming that the chosen `q` and `r` satisfy the conditions.

This variant is useful in certain applications where the standard division algorithm's remainder is too large or too small.
