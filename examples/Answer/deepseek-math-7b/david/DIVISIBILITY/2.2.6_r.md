### Explanation
1. **Modular Arithmetic Setup**:
   - We consider the possible remainders of `n` when divided by 7. Since 7 is prime, by Fermat's Little Theorem, the possible remainders are `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - For each possible remainder `r` of `n % 7`, we compute `n^3 % 7` using the fact that `n ≡ r (mod 7)`.
   - The `simp` tactic simplifies the expression `n^3 % 7` for each case, and `omega` is used to solve the resulting linear arithmetic problems.

3. **Verification**:
   - For each case, we confirm that `n^3 % 7` is either 0, 1, or 6. This exhausts all possible remainders of `n^3` modulo 7.

### Normal Language Explanation
1. **Cube Form**:
   - We need to show that the cube of any integer is congruent to 0, 1, or 6 modulo 7.

2. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Any integer `n` can be written as `7k + r` where `r` is one of `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.
   - The cube of `n` is `n^3 = (7k + r)^3 = 7^3 * k^3 + 3 * 7^2 * k^2 * r + 3 * 7 * k * r^2 + r^3`.
   - Taking modulo 7, all terms except `r^3` vanish, so `n^3 ≡ r^3 (mod 7)`.

3. **Possible Values of `r^3`**:
   - For `r = 0`, `0^3 ≡ 0 (mod 7)`.
   - For `r = 1`, `1^3 ≡ 1 (mod 7)`.
   - For `r = 2`, `2^3 = 8 ≡ 1 (mod 7)`.
   - For `r = 3`, `3^3 = 27 ≡ 6 (mod 7)`.
   - For `r = 4`, `4^3 = 64 ≡ 1 (mod 7)`.
   - For `r = 5`, `5^3 = 125 ≡ 6 (mod 7)`.
   - For `r = 6`, `6^3 = 216 ≡ 6 (mod 7)`.
   - Thus, `n^3 % 7` can only be 0, 1, or 6.

### Conclusion
The cube of any integer is congruent to 0, 1, or 6 modulo 7. This is verified by checking all possible remainders of `n` modulo 7 and computing the cube modulo 7 for each case.
