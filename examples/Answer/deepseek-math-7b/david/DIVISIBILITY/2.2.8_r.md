### Explanation

1. **Assumption and Setup**:
   - We assume for contradiction that there exists a natural number `k` such that `k^2 = 11 * 10^n + 1` for some `n`.
   - We then express `k` in terms of its last digit and the remaining part, i.e., `k = 10 * m + r` where `r` is the last digit of `k` (0-9).

2. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - We analyze the equation modulo 10 to find constraints on the possible last digits of `k`.
   - We consider all possible last digits of `k` (0 through 9) and check which ones satisfy the equation modulo 10.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - For each possible last digit `r` of `k`, we compute `k^2 mod 10` and compare it to `(11 * 10^n + 1) mod 10`.
   - We find that none of the possible last digits of `k` satisfy the equation, leading to a contradiction.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since no `k` can satisfy the equation for any `n`, the original statement is proven.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **Understand the Sequence**:
   - The sequence is `11, 111, 1111, 11111, ...`, which can be written as `11 * 10^0 + 1`, `11 * 10^1 + 1`, `11 * 10^2 + 1`, etc.

2. **Assume a Perfect Square Exists**:
   - Suppose for contradiction that for some `n`, `11 * 10^n + 1` is a perfect square, i.e., `k^2 = 11 * 10^n + 1` for some `k`.

3. **Analyze Modulo 10**:
   - Compute `k^2 mod 10` for each possible last digit of `k` (0-9).
   - Compute `(11 * 10^n + 1) mod 10 = 1 mod 10` for all `n ≥ 0`.
   - Compare the two results to find that no `k` can satisfy the equation.

4. **Contradiction**:
   - Since `k^2 mod 10` can only be 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9, but `11 * 10^n + 1 mod 10` is always 1, no `k` can satisfy the equation.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, no term in the sequence is a perfect square.
