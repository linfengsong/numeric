(a) 6x +51y = 22.
We can check if the equation 6x + 51y = 22 has integer solutions by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6 and 51, which is 3. Then, we check if 22 is divisible by 3. Since 22 is not divisible by 3 (22 ÷ 3 ≈ 7.333), there are no integer solutions for this equation.
(b) 33x + 14y = 115.
We find the gcd of 33 and 14, which is 1. Since 1 divides 115, there are integer solutions for this equation.
(c) 14x + 35y = 93.
We find the gcd of 14 and 35, which is 7. Since 7 does not divide 93 (93 ÷ 7 ≈ 13.2857), there are no integer solutions for this equation.
Thus, the equation that cannot be solved is (a) 6x + 51y = 22.
