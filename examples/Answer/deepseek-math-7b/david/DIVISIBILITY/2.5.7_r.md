theorem check_amount : ∃ n : ℕ, n ≥ 68 ∧ 100 * n + 1 ≤ 2 * (100 * (n - 1) + 68) := by
  /-
  To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that:
  1. \( n \geq 68 \)
  2. \( 100n + 1 \leq 2 \times (100(n - 1) + 68) \)
  
  First, simplify the inequality:
  \[ 100n + 1 \leq 2 \times (100n - 100 + 68) \]
  \[ 100n + 1 \leq 200n - 200 + 136 \]
  \[ 100n + 1 \leq 200n - 64 \]
  \[ 100n + 1 - 200n \leq -64 \]
  \[ -100n + 1 \leq -64 \]
  \[ -100n \leq -64 - 1 \]
  \[ -100n \leq -65 \]
  \[ 100n \geq 65 \]
  \[ n \geq \frac{65}{100} \]
  \[ n \geq 0.65 \]
  
  Since \( n \) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \( n \) is 1. However, we need to ensure that \( n \geq 68 \). Given that \( n \geq 0.65 \), the smallest integer greater than or equal to 0.65 is 1. But 1 is less than 68, so we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n \geq 68 \).
  
  Testing \( n = 68 \):
  \[ 100 \times 68 + 1 = 6801 \]
  \[ 2 \times (100 \times (68 - 1) + 68) = 2 \times (6700 + 68) = 2 \times 6768 = 13536 \]
  \[ 6801 \leq 13536 \]
  This is true.
  
  Thus, the smallest value for which the check could have been written is \( \$68.68 \).
