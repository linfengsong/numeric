### Explanation

1. **Initial Setup**: We start by using the commutativity of `gcd` to rearrange the terms. This is a standard tactic to simplify the problem by ensuring the arguments are in a consistent order.

2. **First Simplification**: We use the property that `gcd(a, b) = gcd(-a, b)`. This is because the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is the same as the greatest common divisor of `-a` and `b`. This is because the divisors of `a` and `-a` are the same, and `gcd` is unaffected by negation.

3. **Second Simplification**: We continue simplifying using the commutativity of `gcd` and the property that `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, -b)`. This is because the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is the same as the greatest common divisor of `a` and `-b`.

4. **Final Simplification**: We use the commutativity of `gcd` again to ensure the arguments are in the correct order, and then use the property that `gcd(a, b) = gcd(-a, -b)`. This is because the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is the same as the greatest common divisor of `-a` and `-b`.

### Normal Language Explanation

The proof leverages the fact that the greatest common divisor of two integers is the same regardless of whether we consider the integers themselves or their negatives. This is because the divisors of a number and its negation are the same, and the `gcd` function ignores the sign of its arguments.

1. **gcd(a, b) = gcd(-a, b)**:
   - The divisors of `a` and `-a` are the same, so their `gcd` is the same.

2. **gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, -b)**:
   - Similarly, the divisors of `b` and `-b` are the same, so their `gcd` is the same.

3. **gcd(a, b) = gcd(-a, -b)**:
   - The divisors of both `a` and `b` are the same as the divisors of `-a` and `-b`, so their `gcd` is the same.

This symmetry allows us to conclude that the `gcd` of any two integers is the same as the `gcd` of their negatives, and thus the original statement is proven.
