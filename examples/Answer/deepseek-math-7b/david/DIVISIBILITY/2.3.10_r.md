### Explanation
1. **Theorem Statement**: We aim to prove that for any nonzero integer `a`, `gcd(a, 0) = |a|`.
2. **Proof Sketch**:
   - Use the definition of `gcd` and properties of `gcd` with zero.
   - Simplify the expression using the fact that `gcd(a, 0) = |a|` directly.
3. **Lean4 Proof**:
   - Introduce `a` and the assumption `a ≠ 0`.
   - Use the definition of `gcd` and properties of `gcd` with zero.
   - Simplify the expression using the fact that `gcd(a, 0) = |a|` directly.
   - Conclude the proof by exact application of the derived equality.

### Normal Language Proof
1. **gcd(a, 0)**:
   - By definition, `gcd(a, 0)` is the largest positive integer that divides both `a` and `0`.
   - The only positive integer that divides `0` is `1` (since any integer divides `0`).
   - However, since `a ≠ 0`, `a` is a nonzero integer, and the largest positive integer dividing `a` is `|a|` (the absolute value of `a`).
   - Thus, `gcd(a, 0) = |a|`.

2. **gcd(a, a)**:
   - `gcd(a, a)` is the largest positive integer that divides both `a` and `a`.
   - Clearly, `a` divides itself, and the largest such integer is `|a|`.
   - Thus, `gcd(a, a) = |a|`.

3. **gcd(a, 1)**:
   - `gcd(a, 1)` is the largest positive integer that divides both `a` and `1`.
   - The only positive integer that divides `1` is `1` itself.
   - Thus, `gcd(a, 1) = 1`.

### Lean4 Proof for gcd(a, a)
```lean4
theorem gcd_self : ∀ a : ℤ, gcd a a = |a| := by
  intro a
  have h₁ : gcd a a = |a| := by
    rw [gcd]
    simp_all [Nat.gcd_self, abs_eq_max_neg]
    <;> cases' le_total 0 a with h₂ h₂ <;> simp_all [max_eq_iff, le_of_lt]
    <;> omega
  exact h₁
```

### Lean4 Proof for gcd(a, 1)
```lean4
theorem gcd_one : ∀ a : ℤ, gcd a 1 = 1 := by
  intro a
  have h₁ : gcd a 1 = 1 := by
    rw [gcd]
    simp_all [Nat.gcd_one_right]
  exact h₁
