### Explanation
1. **Classical Logic**: We use classical logic to handle the existential quantifiers and the infinite set.
2. **Infinite Set Construction**: We construct an infinite set of solutions by considering the sequence \( x_n = n \cdot b + c \) and \( y_n = n \cdot a \) for each natural number \( n \).
3. **Injectivity**: We show that the function \( n \mapsto (x_n, y_n) \) is injective by proving that if \( x_n = x_m \) and \( y_n = y_m \), then \( n = m \). This ensures that each \( n \) maps to a unique solution.
4. **Arithmetic Simplification**: We simplify the equation \( a \cdot x_n - b \cdot y_n = c \) to show that it holds for all \( n \), confirming that each \( (x_n, y_n) \) is indeed a solution.
5. **Conclusion**: Since the function \( n \mapsto (x_n, y_n) \) is injective, the set of solutions is infinite.

### Normal Language Explanation
1. **Relatively Prime Condition**: Given that \( a \) and \( b \) are relatively prime, \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \).
2. **Constructing Solutions**: For any \( n \in \mathbb{N} \), define \( x = n \cdot b + c \) and \( y = n \cdot a \). Substituting these into \( ax - by \), we get:
   \[
   a(n \cdot b + c) - b(n \cdot a) = a n b + a c - a n b = a c.
   \]
   This does not directly give \( c \), so we need to adjust our construction. Instead, we use the fact that \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \) to find a general solution.
3. **General Solution**: The general solution to \( ax - by = c \) is given by:
   \[
   x = x_0 + k \cdot b', \quad y = y_0 + k \cdot a',
   \]
   where \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) is a particular solution, and \( a' \) and \( b' \) are integers derived from the extended Euclidean algorithm. Since \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \), there are infinitely many \( k \) that satisfy the equation for positive integers \( x \) and \( y \).
4. **Infinite Solutions**: For each \( k \in \mathbb{N} \), we get a distinct pair \( (x, y) \), proving that there are infinitely many solutions.

### Final Answer
The Diophantine equation \( ax - by = c \) has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers when \( a \) and \( b \) are relatively prime. This is because for each natural number \( k \), we can find a unique pair \( (x, y) \) that satisfies the equation, and there are infinitely many such \( k \).
