### Explanation

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to show that if `a` and `b` are odd integers, then `8` divides `a² - b²`.
   - This is equivalent to showing that `a² ≡ b² (mod 8)`, or `a² - b² ≡ 0 (mod 8)`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - All odd integers modulo 8 can only be one of the following: 1, 3, 5, or 7.
   - Squaring these residues gives:
     - `1² ≡ 1 (mod 8)`
     - `3² ≡ 9 ≡ 1 (mod 8)`
     - `5² ≡ 25 ≡ 1 (mod 8)`
     - `7² ≡ 49 ≡ 1 (mod 8)`
   - Thus, `a² ≡ 1 (mod 8)` and `b² ≡ 1 (mod 8)`, so `a² - b² ≡ 0 (mod 8)`.

3. **Proof Sketch**:
   - We first show that for any odd integer `x`, `x² ≡ 1 (mod 8)`.
   - Then, since `a` and `b` are odd, we have `a² ≡ 1 (mod 8)` and `b² ≡ 1 (mod 8)`.
   - Subtracting these congruences gives `a² - b² ≡ 0 (mod 8)`, which means `8` divides `a² - b²`.

4. **Lean4 Proof Steps**:
   - We use `have` statements to break down the proof into smaller, manageable parts.
   - `h₃` shows that `a² ≡ 1 (mod 8)` for any odd `a`.
   - `h₄` shows the same for `b`.
   - Finally, `omega` is used to combine these results to conclude that `8 ∣ (a² - b²)`.

### Normal Language Proof

1. **Step 1: Express `a` and `b` in terms of their residues modulo 8.**
   - Since `a` is odd, `a ≡ 1, 3, 5, or 7 (mod 8)`.
   - Similarly, `b ≡ 1, 3, 5, or 7 (mod 8)`.

2. **Step 2: Compute `a²` and `b²` modulo 8.**
   - For each possible residue of `a` and `b`, compute `a²` and `b²`:
     - If `a ≡ 1 (mod 8)`, then `a² ≡ 1 (mod 8)`.
     - If `a ≡ 3 (mod 8)`, then `a² ≡ 9 ≡ 1 (mod 8)`.
     - Similarly for `a ≡ 5` and `a ≡ 7 (mod 8)`.
   - Similarly for `b`.

3. **Step 3: Subtract the congruences.**
   - Since `a² ≡ 1 (mod 8)` and `b² ≡ 1 (mod 8)`, we have `a² - b² ≡ 0 (mod 8)`.
   - This means `8` divides `a² - b²`.

### Conclusion

The proof leverages the fact that the square of any odd integer is congruent to 1 modulo 8, and thus the difference of two such squares is divisible by 8. The Lean4 proof formalizes this reasoning by breaking it down into smaller steps and using modular arithmetic to verify the result.
