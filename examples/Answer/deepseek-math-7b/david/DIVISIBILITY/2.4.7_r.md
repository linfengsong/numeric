### Explanation

1. **First Condition (a ∣ b) ↔ gcd(a, b) = |a|**:
   - If `a ∣ b`, then `gcd(a, b) = |a|` because `a` and `b` share the same divisors, and `gcd(a, b)` is the largest such divisor.
   - Conversely, if `gcd(a, b) = |a|`, then `a` must divide `b` because `gcd(a, b)` is a divisor of both `a` and `b`, and `|a|` is the largest such divisor.

2. **Second Condition (gcd(a, b) = |a|) ∧ (lcm(a, b) = |b|)**:
   - This is a direct translation of the conditions into Lean4 syntax.

3. **Combining the Conditions**:
   - The equivalence is established by combining the two conditions and ensuring that the implications flow correctly.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **Condition (a) ↔ Condition (b)**:
   - If `a` divides `b`, then the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is `|a|` because `a` and `b` share the same divisors, and `|a|` is the largest such divisor.
   - Conversely, if the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is `|a|`, then `a` must divide `b` because `|a|` is the largest divisor shared by `a` and `b`, implying `a` divides `b`.

2. **Condition (b) ↔ Condition (c)**:
   - The least common multiple of `a` and `b` is `|b|` if and only if `b` is a multiple of `a` and `|b|` is the smallest such multiple. This is equivalent to `a` dividing `b` because `lcm(a, b) = |b|` implies that `b` is a multiple of `a` and `|b|` is the smallest such multiple.

3. **Combining the Conditions**:
   - The equivalence is established by showing that each condition implies the other and that the implications flow correctly.
