### Normal Language Proof
The number 1234 is even, so it is divisible by 2. Performing the division, we get 1234 ÷ 2 = 617. Since 617 is a prime number, the prime factorization of 1234 is 2 × 617.

```

### Normal Language Proof
First, we check divisibility by 2. Since 10140 is even, it is divisible by 2. Dividing, we get 10140 ÷ 2 = 5070. Next, we check divisibility by 2 again for 5070, which is also even. Dividing, we get 5070 ÷ 2 = 2535. Now, we check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 2535 is 2 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Thus, 2535 is divisible by 3. Dividing, we get 2535 ÷ 3 = 845. Next, we check divisibility by 5. The last digit of 845 is 5, so it is divisible by 5. Dividing, we get 845 ÷ 5 = 169. Finally, we check the primality of 169. Since 169 = 13², it is a perfect square. Thus, the prime factorization of 10140 is 2² × 3 × 5 × 13².

```

### Normal Language Proof
First, we check divisibility by 2. Since 36000 is even, it is divisible by 2. Dividing, we get 36000 ÷ 2 = 18000. Next, we check divisibility by 2 again for 18000, which is also even. Dividing, we get 18000 ÷ 2 = 9000. We continue this process until we cannot divide by 2 anymore. After dividing by 2 five times, we get 36000 = 2⁵ × 9000. Next, we check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 9000 is 9, which is divisible by 3. Thus, 9000 is divisible by 3. Dividing, we get 9000 ÷ 3 = 3000. We continue this process for 3000, which is also divisible by 3. Dividing, we get 3000 ÷ 3 = 1000. Finally, we check divisibility by 5. The last digit of 1000 is 0, so it is divisible by 5. Dividing, we get 1000 ÷ 5 = 200. We continue this process for 200, which is also divisible by 5. Dividing, we get 200 ÷ 5 = 40. Finally, we check divisibility by 5 again for 40, which is also divisible by 5. Dividing, we get 40 ÷ 5 = 8. The number 8 is 2³, so the prime factorization of 36000 is 2⁵ × 3² × 5³.
