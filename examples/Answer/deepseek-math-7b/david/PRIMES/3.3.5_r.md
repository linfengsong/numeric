### Explanation
1. **Assumption of the Conjecture**: We assume the conjecture holds for all odd integers, i.e., for every odd \( n \), there exists a prime \( p \leq n \) and a non-negative integer \( a \) such that \( n = p + 2a^2 \).
2. **Application to 5777**: We apply this assumption to \( n = 5777 \), which is odd.
3. **Existence of \( p \) and \( a \)**: By the assumption, there must exist \( p \) and \( a \) satisfying the conditions.
4. **Case Analysis on \( p \)**: We consider all possible values of \( p \) (since \( p \leq 5777 \)) and check if \( 5777 = p + 2a^2 \) can hold for some \( a \).
5. **Prime Check and \( a \) Bounds**:
   - For each possible \( p \), we check if \( p \) is prime.
   - We also bound \( a \) by ensuring \( 2a^2 \leq 5777 \), i.e., \( a \leq 57 \).
6. **Contradiction**: We find that none of the possible \( p \) values (especially those near 5777) can satisfy the equation \( 5777 = p + 2a^2 \) for any \( a \in \mathbb{N} \). This leads to a contradiction, proving the conjecture is false.

### Normal Language Explanation
The conjecture claims that every odd integer can be written as \( p + 2a^2 \), where \( p \) is either a prime or 1, and \( a \geq 0 \). To disprove this, we need to find an odd integer that cannot be expressed in this form. We choose \( n = 5777 \), which is odd.

We then check all possible values of \( p \) (from 0 to 5777) to see if there exists an \( a \) such that \( 5777 = p + 2a^2 \). The key observation is that \( 5777 \) is congruent to \( 1 \) modulo \( 4 \), which restricts the possible values of \( p \) and \( a \). Specifically, \( p \) must be odd (since \( 2a^2 \) is even), and \( p \) cannot be \( 2 \) (since \( 5777 \) is odd).

After checking all possible \( p \), we find that no \( p \) and \( a \) satisfy the equation. This disproves the conjecture.

### Conclusion
The integer \( 5777 \) is a counterexample to the Goldbach conjecture as stated, as it cannot be written in the form \( p + 2a^2 \) where \( p \) is a prime or 1 and \( a \geq 0 \).
