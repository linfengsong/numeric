### Explanation

1. **Initial Setup**: We start by introducing `n` and the hypothesis `hn` that `n ≤ 5`.
2. **Case Analysis**: We consider each possible value of `n` from 0 to 5 using `rcases` to break down the proof into cases.
3. **Decide Tactics**: For each case, we use `decide` to automatically verify the statement. This tactic is used to check the primality of the resulting numbers, leveraging Lean's automation for small cases.
4. **Normalization and Simplification**: For each case, `norm_num` is used to simplify the expressions and verify the primality of the resulting numbers.

### Normal Language Explanation

For each value of `n` from 0 to 5, we compute `Pn` (the product of the first `n` primes plus 1), find the smallest prime `qn` greater than `Pn`, and then check that `qn - Pn` is prime.

- **n = 0**: `P0 = 1` (empty product), `q0 = 2` (next prime after 1), `q0 - P0 = 1` (not prime, but the conjecture is about `qn - Pn` being prime, and `1` is not prime. However, the Lean4 code seems to have a discrepancy here. The Lean4 code defines `Pn` as `Nat.factorization (∏ i in Finset.range n, Nat.prime i) 1`, which for `n = 0` is `1` (since the product is empty). Then `P0 + 1 = 2`, and `Nat.minFac 2 = 2`, so `qn - Pn = 1`, which is not prime. This suggests the Lean4 code might not correctly represent the conjecture.
- **n = 1**: `P1 = 2`, `q1 = 3`, `q1 - P1 = 1` (not prime).
- **n = 2**: `P2 = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7`, `q2 = 11` (next prime after 7), `q2 - P2 = 4` (not prime).
- **n = 3**: `P3 = 2 * 3 * 5 + 1 = 31`, `q3 = 37`, `q3 - P3 = 6` (not prime).
- **n = 4**: `P4 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 + 1 = 211`, `q4 = 223`, `q4 - P4 = 12` (not prime).
- **n = 5**: `P5 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 + 1 = 2311`, `q5 = 2333`, `q5 - P5 = 22` (not prime).

This shows that the conjecture does not hold for all `n ≤ 5`, as the differences are not always prime. The Lean4 code might have a different definition of `Pn` or `qn` that does not align with the mathematical conjecture.

### Corrected Lean4 Proof

If the conjecture is about `qn - Pn` being prime, then the Lean4 code should be updated to reflect this. For example, if `Pn` is defined as `∏ i in Finset.range n, Nat.prime i + 1`, then:

- `n = 0`: `P0 = 2`, `q0 = 3`, `q0 - P0 = 1` (not prime).
- `n = 1`: `P1 = 3`, `q1 = 5`, `q1 - P1 = 2` (prime).
- `n = 2`: `P2 = 7`, `q2 = 11`, `q2 - P2 = 4` (not prime).
- `n = 3`: `P3 = 31`, `q3 = 37`, `q3 - P3 = 6` (not prime).
- `n = 4`: `P4 = 211`, `q4 = 223`, `q4 - P4 = 12` (not prime).
- `n = 5`: `P5 = 2311`, `q5 = 2333`, `q5 - P5 = 22` (not prime).

This still does not hold for all `n ≤ 5`. The correct Lean4 code should reflect the correct mathematical conjecture.

### Final Answer

The conjecture does not hold for all `n ≤ 5` as shown by the counterexamples. The Lean4 code should be updated to reflect the correct mathematical conjecture.
