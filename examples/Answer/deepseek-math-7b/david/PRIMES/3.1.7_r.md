### Explanation
1. **Introduction of Variables and Assumptions**:
   - We introduce a prime number `p` and assume it divides `50!` (`p ∣ Nat.factorial 50`).
   - We aim to prove that `p ≤ 50`.

2. **Proof Sketch**:
   - Since `p` is a prime number and divides `50!`, we know that `p` must be one of the prime factors of `50!`.
   - The prime factors of `50!` are all primes less than or equal to `50` (since `50!` includes all integers from `1` to `50`).
   - Therefore, `p` must be less than or equal to `50`.

3. **Lean4 Proof Steps**:
   - We use the fact that `p` divides `50!` to infer that `p` must be less than or equal to `50`.
   - The `exact?` tactic is used to automatically solve the goal, leveraging the properties of prime numbers and factorials.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The proof is complete, and we have shown that every prime number `p` that divides `50!` must satisfy `p ≤ 50`.
