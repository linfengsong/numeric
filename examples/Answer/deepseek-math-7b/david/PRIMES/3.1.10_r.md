### Explanation
1. **Assumptions and Initial Setup**:
   - We start by assuming `p` is a prime number, `p ≠ 5`, and `p` is odd (`p % 2 = 1`).
   - We use the fact that if a prime `p` divides `2`, then `p = 2` (since `2` is the only even prime).
   - Similarly, if `p` divides `5`, then `p = 5` (since `5` is the only prime divisible by `5`).
   - We also consider the possible residues of `p` modulo `10` because `10 = 2 * 5` and primes cannot be divisible by `2` or `5` except for `2` and `5` themselves.

2. **Case Analysis on `p % 10`**:
   - The possible residues of `p` modulo `10` when `p` is an odd prime and `p ≠ 5` are `1, 3, 7,` or `9`.
   - For each case, we compute `p^2 mod 10` and check if `p^2 - 1` or `p^2 + 1` is divisible by `10`.

3. **Verification for Each Case**:
   - If `p ≡ 1 mod 10`, then `p^2 ≡ 1 mod 10`, so `p^2 - 1 ≡ 0 mod 10` (i.e., `10 ∣ p^2 - 1`).
   - If `p ≡ 3 mod 10`, then `p^2 ≡ 9 mod 10`, so `p^2 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 10` (i.e., `10 ∣ p^2 + 1`).
   - If `p ≡ 7 mod 10`, then `p^2 ≡ 49 ≡ 9 mod 10`, so `p^2 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 10` (i.e., `10 ∣ p^2 + 1`).
   - If `p ≡ 9 mod 10`, then `p^2 ≡ 81 ≡ 1 mod 10`, so `p^2 - 1 ≡ 0 mod 10` (i.e., `10 ∣ p^2 - 1`).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - In all cases, either `p^2 - 1` or `p^2 + 1` is divisible by `10`, proving the theorem.

### Normal Language Explanation
1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We need to show that for any odd prime `p ≠ 5`, either `p^2 - 1` or `p^2 + 1` is divisible by `10`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Since `p` is a prime and `p ≠ 5`, `p` cannot be divisible by `2` or `5` (except `p = 2` or `p = 5`, but `p` is odd and `p ≠ 5`).
   - Therefore, `p` must be odd and not divisible by `5`, so `p` can only end with `1, 3, 7,` or `9` in its decimal representation.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - If `p` ends with `1`, then `p^2` ends with `1`, so `p^2 - 1` ends with `0` and is divisible by `10`.
   - If `p` ends with `3`, then `p^2` ends with `9`, so `p^2 + 1` ends with `0` and is divisible by `10`.
   - If `p` ends with `7`, then `p^2` ends with `9`, so `p^2 + 1` ends with `0` and is divisible by `10`.
   - If `p` ends with `9`, then `p^2` ends with `1`, so `p^2 - 1` ends with `0` and is divisible by `10`.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - In all cases, either `p^2 - 1` or `p^2 + 1` is divisible by `10`.
