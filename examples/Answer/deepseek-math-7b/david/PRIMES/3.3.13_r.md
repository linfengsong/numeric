### Explanation

1. **Infinite Primes**: We use the fact that there are infinitely many primes (Euclid's theorem). Specifically, we use `Nat.exists_infinite_primes` to find a prime `p` greater than `6 * N + 6`.
2. **Modulo 6 Analysis**: We analyze the possible residues of primes modulo 6. A prime `p` cannot be divisible by 2 or 3 (since `p > 3` and `p` is prime). Thus, `p % 6` must be either 1 or 5.
3. **Filtering Primes**: We filter out the primes that are divisible by 2 or 3, leaving only those that are congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.
4. **Conclusion**: We conclude that there must be infinitely many primes congruent to 5 modulo 6, as required.

### Normal Language Proof

1. **Infinite Primes**: Assume for contradiction that there are only finitely many primes of the form `6n + 5`. Let these primes be `p₁, p₂, ..., p_k`.
2. **Construct a New Prime**: Consider the number `N = 6 * p₁ * p₂ * ... * p_k - 1`. This number is not divisible by any of the primes `p₁, p₂, ..., p_k` (since subtracting 1 from a multiple of their product ensures it is not divisible by any of them).
3. **Find a New Prime**: By Euclid's theorem, `N` must have a prime factor `p` that is not in the original list. This prime `p` cannot be 2 or 3, so it must be of the form `6n + 1` or `6n + 5`.
4. **Contradiction**: If `p` were of the form `6n + 1`, then `N ≡ -1 ≡ 5 mod 6`, which would imply `p` is of the form `6n + 5`. This contradicts the assumption that all primes of the form `6n + 5` are in the original list.
5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, there must be infinitely many primes of the form `6n + 5`.

### Final Answer

The Lean4 proof and the normal language proof both use Euclid's theorem and properties of primes modulo 6 to show that there are infinitely many primes of the form `6n + 5`. The Lean4 proof is more concise and leverages Lean's library of number theory results, while the normal language proof provides a more detailed explanation of the underlying mathematical reasoning.
