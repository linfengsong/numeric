### Explanation
1. **Assumption and Setup**:
   - We assume there exist a prime `p` and a natural number `k` such that `509 = p + 2^k`.
   - We rewrite the equation to `509 = p + 2^k` for clarity.

2. **Bounding `p`**:
   - Since `p` is a prime and `2^k` is a power of 2, `p` must be less than or equal to `509`.
   - We use contradiction to show that `p` cannot exceed `509`.

3. **Case Analysis on `p`**:
   - We systematically check all primes `p` less than or equal to `509` and for each, we check if `509 - p` is a power of 2.
   - This involves checking all primes up to `509` and verifying that none of them plus a power of 2 equals `509`.

4. **Verification**:
   - For each possible `p`, we compute `509 - p` and check if it is a power of 2.
   - If `509 - p` is not a power of 2, we discard that `p` and proceed to the next candidate.
   - If `509 - p` is a power of 2, we verify that `k` exists such that `509 = p + 2^k`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - After exhausting all possible `p`, we conclude that no such `p` and `k` exist for `509`, thus disproving the claim.

### Normal Language Explanation

The proof involves showing that for the integer `509`, there is no prime `p` and no power of 2 `2^k` such that `509 = p + 2^k`. This is done by systematically checking all possible primes `p` and verifying that `509 - p` is not a power of 2.

1. **Bounding `p`**:
   - Since `p` is a prime and `2^k` is a power of 2, `p` must be less than or equal to `509`.

2. **Case Analysis on `p`**:
   - We consider all primes `p` from 2 up to 509 and check if `509 - p` is a power of 2.

3. **Verification**:
   - For each `p`, we compute `509 - p` and check if it is a power of 2.
   - If `509 - p` is not a power of 2, we proceed to the next `p`.
   - If `509 - p` is a power of 2, we verify that `k` exists such that `509 = p + 2^k`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - After checking all possible `p`, we find that no such `p` and `k` exist for `509`, thus disproving the claim.

### Explanation for 877

The proof for `877` is analogous to the proof for `509`. We assume there exists a prime `p` and a natural number `k` such that `877 = p + 2^k`, and then we systematically check all possible primes `p` up to `877` to see if `877 - p` is a power of 2.

1. **Bounding `p`**:
   - Since `p` is a prime and `2^k` is a power of 2, `p` must be less than or equal to `877`.

2. **Case Analysis on `p`**:
   - We consider all primes `p` from 2 up to 877 and check if `877 - p` is a power of 2.

3. **Verification**:
   - For each `p`, we compute `877 - p` and check if it is a power of 2.
   - If `877 - p` is not a power of 2, we proceed to the next `p`.
   - If `877 - p` is a power of 2, we verify that `k` exists such that `877 = p + 2^k`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - After checking all possible `p`, we find that no such `p` and `k` exist for `877`, thus disproving the claim.
