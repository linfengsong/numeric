### Lean4 Proof

```lean4
theorem euclid_infinite_primes : ∀ (p : ℕ), p.Prime → ∃ (q : ℕ), q.Prime ∧ q > p := by
  intro p hp
  have h := Nat.exists_infinite_primes (p + 1)
  cases' h with q hq
  use q
  have hq' := hq.1
  have hq'' := hq.2
  simp_all [Nat.Prime]
  <;> omega
```

### Explanation

1. **Assumption**: Assume there is a largest prime `p`.
2. **Construct `N`**: Let `N = p! + 1` (the factorial of `p` plus one).
3. **Divisibility by Primes**: Any prime `q` dividing `N` must be greater than `p` because `q` cannot divide `p!` (since `q > p` and `p!` includes all primes up to `p`).
4. **Contradiction**: This leads to a contradiction because `N` has a prime factor `q` that is not in the original list of primes (contradicting the assumption that `p` is the largest prime).

### Lean4 Proof with `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem euclid_infinite_primes : ∀ (p : ℕ), p.Prime → ∃ (q : ℕ), q.Prime ∧ q > p := by
  intro p hp
  have h_factorial_plus_one : ∃ (q : ℕ), q.Prime ∧ q ∣ (Nat.factorial p + 1) := by
    sorry
  have h_prime_factor : ∀ (n : ℕ), n.Prime → n ∣ (Nat.factorial p + 1) → n > p := by
    sorry
  have h_exists_prime_gt_p : ∃ (q : ℕ), q.Prime ∧ q > p := by
    sorry
  exact h_exists_prime_gt_p
```

### Explanation of `have` Statements

1. **`h_factorial_plus_one`**: This states that there exists a prime `q` that divides `p! + 1`. This is a key step in the proof, as it shows that `p! + 1` has at least one prime factor.
2. **`h_prime_factor`**: This states that any prime `q` that divides `p! + 1` must be greater than `p`. This is because `p!` includes all primes up to `p`, and `q` cannot divide `p!` if `q ≤ p` (since `q` would have to be one of the primes in `p!`).
3. **`h_exists_prime_gt_p`**: This directly concludes the proof by showing that there exists a prime `q` greater than `p`, contradicting the assumption that `p` is the largest prime.
