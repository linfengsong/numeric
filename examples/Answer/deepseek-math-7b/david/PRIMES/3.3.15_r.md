### Explanation

1. **Assumption**: We assume the existence of an infinite set \( S \) of five consecutive odd integers, each of which contains exactly four primes.
2. **Contradiction**: We show that this leads to a contradiction. The set \( S \) must be finite because it is a subset of the natural numbers, but we assumed it is infinite.
3. **Conclusion**: The assumption that such an infinite set \( S \) exists is false, hence no such infinite set exists.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **Assumption**: Suppose there exists an infinite set \( S \) of five consecutive odd integers, each of which contains exactly four primes.
2. **Contradiction**: The set \( S \) cannot be infinite because the set of natural numbers is infinite, but the set of primes is infinite, and the set of odd numbers is infinite. However, the number of primes in five consecutive odd numbers cannot be exactly four in an infinite number of cases because the distribution of primes is not uniform.
3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, no such infinite set \( S \) can exist.

### Additional Sets of Five Consecutive Odd Integers with Four Primes

Here are five examples of sets of five consecutive odd integers with exactly four primes:

1. **Set 1**: \( \{11, 13, 15, 17, 19\} \)
   - Primes: 11, 13, 17, 19
   - Non-primes: 15

2. **Set 2**: \( \{101, 103, 105, 107, 109\} \)
   - Primes: 101, 103, 107, 109
   - Non-primes: 105

3. **Set 3**: \( \{191, 193, 195, 197, 199\} \)
   - Primes: 191, 193, 197, 199
   - Non-primes: 195

4. **Set 4**: \( \{281, 283, 285, 287, 289\} \)
   - Primes: 281, 283, 287, 289
   - Non-primes: 285

5. **Set 5**: \( \{371, 373, 375, 377, 379\} \)
   - Primes: 371, 373, 377, 379
   - Non-primes: 375

These examples demonstrate that there are infinitely many sets of five consecutive odd integers with exactly four primes. The Lean4 proof, however, shows that no infinite set of such integers can exist because the distribution of primes is not uniform enough to guarantee four primes in an infinite number of cases.
