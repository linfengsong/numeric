### Lean4 Proof Sketch
```lean4
theorem infinitude_of_primes : ∀ (n : ℕ), ∃ (p : ℕ), p.Prime ∧ p > n := by
  intro n
  have h := Nat.exists_infinite_primes (n + 1)
  cases' h with p hp
  use p
  <;> simp_all [Nat.Prime]
  <;> omega
```
### Explanation
1. **Assumption**: Assume for contradiction that there are only finitely many primes, say \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \).
2. **Construct \( A \) and \( B \)**:
   - Let \( A \) be the product of any \( r \) of these primes (we can choose \( r = 1 \) for simplicity).
   - Let \( B = \frac{p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n}{A} \).
3. **Divisibility**:
   - Each \( p_k \) divides either \( A \) or \( B \), but not both.
4. **Contradiction**:
   - Since \( A + B > 1 \), \( A + B \) has a prime divisor not in \( \{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\} \), contradicting the assumption that all primes are in \( \{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\} \).
