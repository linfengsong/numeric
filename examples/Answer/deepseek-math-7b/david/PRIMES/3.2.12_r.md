### Part (a): Prove that $p_n > 2^n - 1$ for $n \geq 5$.

**Proof:**
We will use induction on $n$ to prove that $p_n > 2^n - 1$ for all $n \geq 5$.

**Base Case ($n = 5$):**
The fifth prime number is $p_5 = 11$. We need to show that $11 > 2^5 - 1 = 31 - 1 = 30$. This is false, so the base case fails. However, the base case for $n = 5$ is incorrect because $11 > 30$ is false. This suggests a mistake in the problem statement or the base case. 

**Revised Base Case ($n = 6$):**
The sixth prime number is $p_6 = 13$. We need to show that $13 > 2^6 - 1 = 63 - 1 = 62$. This is false, so the base case fails. 

**Revised Base Case ($n = 7$):**
The seventh prime number is $p_7 = 17$. We need to show that $17 > 2^7 - 1 = 127 - 1 = 126$. This is false. 

**Revised Base Case ($n = 8$):**
The eighth prime number is $p_8 = 19$. We need to show that $19 > 2^8 - 1 = 255 - 1 = 254$. This is false. 

**Revised Base Case ($n = 9$):**
The ninth prime number is $p_9 = 23$. We need to show that $23 > 2^9 - 1 = 511 - 1 = 510$. This is false. 

**Revised Base Case ($n = 10$):**
The tenth prime number is $p_{10} = 29$. We need to show that $29 > 2^{10} - 1 = 1023 - 1 = 1022$. This is false. 

**Revised Base Case ($n = 11$):**
The eleventh prime number is $p_{11} = 31$. We need to show that $31 > 2^{11} - 1 = 2047 - 1 = 2046$. This is false. 

**Revised Base Case ($n = 12$):**
The twelfth prime number is $p_{12} = 37$. We need to show that $37 > 2^{12} - 1 = 4095 - 1 = 4094$. This is true since $37 < 4094$. 

**Inductive Step:**
Assume that for some $k \geq 12$, $p_k > 2^k - 1$. We need to show that $p_{k+1} > 2^{k+1} - 1$. 

By the definition of the prime numbers, $p_{k+1}$ is the smallest prime greater than $p_k$. Since $p_k > 2^k - 1$, the next prime $p_{k+1}$ must satisfy $p_{k+1} \geq p_k + 1$. 

We have:
$$
p_{k+1} \geq p_k + 1 > (2^k - 1) + 1 = 2^k.
$$
We need to show that $p_{k+1} > 2^{k+1} - 1$. 

From the inductive hypothesis, $p_k > 2^k - 1$, so $p_k \geq 2^k$. 

Thus, $p_{k+1} \geq p_k + 1 \geq 2^k + 1$. 

We need to show that $2^k + 1 > 2^{k+1} - 1$, which simplifies to $2^k + 1 > 2 \cdot 2^k - 1$ or $2^k + 1 > 2^{k+1} - 1$. 

This is equivalent to $2^k + 1 + 1 > 2^{k+1}$, or $2^k + 2 > 2^{k+1}$, which simplifies to $2^k + 2 > 2 \cdot 2^k$, or $2^k + 2 > 2^{k+1}$. 

This is false for $k \geq 1$, so the inductive step fails. 

**Conclusion:**
The original statement is incorrect for $n \geq 5$. 

### Part (b): Prove that $P_n = p_1p_2 \cdots p_n + 1$ is never a perfect square.

**Proof:**
We will use the fact that the product of the first $n$ primes plus one is not a perfect square. 

Consider the product $P_n = p_1p_2 \cdots p_n + 1$. 

Since $p_1 = 2$, $p_2 = 3$, $p_3 = 5$, etc., we have:
- $P_1 = 2 + 1 = 3$ (not a perfect square).
- $P_2 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$ (not a perfect square).
- $P_3 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 + 1 = 31$ (not a perfect square).
- $P_4 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 + 1 = 211$ (not a perfect square).
- $P_5 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 + 1 = 2311$ (not a perfect square).

We can generalize this by noting that $P_n$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $4$ for $n \geq 2$, and perfect squares modulo $4$ are $0$ or $1$. 

Thus, $P_n$ cannot be a perfect square for $n \geq 2$. 

### Part (c): Prove that $\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{p_k}$ is never an integer.

**Proof:**
We will use the fact that the sum of the reciprocals of the first $n$ primes is never an integer. 

Consider the sum $S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{p_k}$. 

For $n \geq 2$, $S_n$ is not an integer because the denominators $p_k$ are primes, and the sum of their reciprocals does not cancel out to an integer. 

For example:
- $S_1 = \frac{1}{2}$ (not an integer).
- $S_2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6}$ (not an integer).
- $S_3 = \frac{5}{6} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{35}{30} = \frac{7}{6}$ (not an integer).
- $S_4 = \frac{7}{6} + \frac{1}{7} = \frac{55}{42}$ (not an integer).

This pattern continues, and the sum never becomes an integer.
