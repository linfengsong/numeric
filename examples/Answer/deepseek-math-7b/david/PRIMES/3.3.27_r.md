### Lean4 Proof

```lean4
theorem exists_prime_le_lt_two_mul (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) : ∃ p, Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≤ n ∧ n < 2 * p := by
  have h : ∃ p, Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≤ n ∧ n < 2 * p := by
    -- Use the theorem `Nat.exists_prime_lt_and_le_two_mul` to find a prime `p` such that `p ≤ n < 2 * p`
    have h₁ := Nat.exists_prime_lt_and_le_two_mul hn
    aesop
  exact h
```

### Explanation

1. **Theorem Application**: The proof uses the theorem `Nat.exists_prime_lt_and_le_two_mul` which states that for any natural number `n ≥ 2`, there exists a prime `p` such that `p ≤ n < 2 * p`. This directly gives us the required prime `p` satisfying the conditions.

2. **Aesop**: The `aesop` tactic is used to automatically solve the goal by applying the appropriate lemmas and theorems. In this case, it applies the result from `Nat.exists_prime_lt_and_le_two_mul` to complete the proof.

3. **Conclusion**: The `have h` statement is used to establish the existence of the prime `p` and then `exact h` is used to close the proof.

### Normal Language Explanation

The theorem states that for every natural number `n` greater than or equal to 2, there exists a prime number `p` such that `p` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than `2 * p`. This is a fundamental result in number theory known as Bertrand's Postulate, which was proven by Chebyshev and later simplified by Erdős.

The proof leverages the fact that for any `n ≥ 2`, there is always a prime number `p` in the interval `(n/2, n]`. This is because the prime number theorem guarantees that the density of primes around `n` is such that at least one prime must lie in this interval. The Lean4 proof directly applies a known theorem (`Nat.exists_prime_lt_and_le_two_mul`) that encapsulates this result.
