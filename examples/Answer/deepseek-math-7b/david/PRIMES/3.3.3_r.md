### Explanation
1. **Initial Setup**: We start by introducing the primes \( p \) and \( q \) and their primality conditions. We also assume \( p - q = 3 \).
2. **Bounds on Primes**: We establish that both \( p \) and \( q \) must be less than or equal to 7 because any larger prime would make \( p - q \) exceed 3.
3. **Case Analysis**: We perform a case analysis on the possible values of \( p \) and \( q \) within the range 2 to 7, using the fact that they are primes and \( p - q = 3 \).
4. **Verification**: For each pair \((p, q)\), we check if \( p - q = 3 \) and if both \( p \) and \( q \) are primes. The only valid pair is \((5, 2)\).

### Normal Language Explanation
The problem asks for pairs of primes \( (p, q) \) such that \( p - q = 3 \). We can find all such pairs by testing small primes:
- \( q = 2 \): \( p = 2 + 3 = 5 \) (both primes).
- \( q = 3 \): \( p = 3 + 3 = 6 \) (6 is not prime).
- \( q = 5 \): \( p = 5 + 3 = 8 \) (8 is not prime).
- \( q = 7 \): \( p = 7 + 3 = 10 \) (10 is not prime).
Thus, the only solution is \( (p, q) = (5, 2) \).

### Lean4 Proof Summary
The Lean4 proof systematically checks all possible small prime pairs \((p, q)\) to find the unique solution \((5, 2)\). The `interval_cases` tactic is used to limit the search space, and `norm_num` verifies primality and the equation \( p - q = 3 \).
