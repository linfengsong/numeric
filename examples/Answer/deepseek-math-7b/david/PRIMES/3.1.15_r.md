### Explanation
1. **Forward Direction (`→`)**:
   - Assume `a = k²` for some integer `k`.
   - For any prime `p`, the exponent of `p` in the prime factorization of `a` is `2 * padicValNat p k` (since `a = (k)^2`).
   - Since `padicValNat p k` is an integer, `2 * padicValNat p k` is even.
   - Thus, `padicValNat p a` is even for all primes `p`.

2. **Backward Direction (`←`)**:
   - Assume that for every prime `p`, the exponent of `p` in the prime factorization of `a` is even.
   - This implies that the exponent of every prime in the prime factorization of `a` is of the form `2 * m` for some integer `m`.
   - Therefore, `a` can be written as `a = ∏ p_i ^ (2 * m_i) = (∏ p_i ^ m_i) ^ 2`, which is a perfect square.

### Normal Language Proof

**Forward Direction (`→`)**:
- Assume `a = k²` for some integer `k`.
- For any prime `p`, the exponent of `p` in the prime factorization of `a` is `2 * padicValNat p k` (since `a = (k)^2`).
- Since `padicValNat p k` is an integer, `2 * padicValNat p k` is even.
- Thus, `padicValNat p a` is even for all primes `p`.

**Backward Direction (`←`)**:
- Assume that for every prime `p`, the exponent of `p` in the prime factorization of `a` is even.
- This implies that the exponent of every prime in the prime factorization of `a` is of the form `2 * m` for some integer `m`.
- Therefore, `a` can be written as `a = ∏ p_i ^ (2 * m_i) = (∏ p_i ^ m_i) ^ 2`, which is a perfect square.

### Conclusion
The proof is complete by showing that a positive integer `a > 1` is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.
