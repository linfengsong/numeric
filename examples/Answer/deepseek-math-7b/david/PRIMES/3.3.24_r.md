### Explanation
1. **Initial Setup**: We start by assuming `p` and `q` are primes, `q = p + 2`, and `pq - 2` is also prime. We need to show that `p = 3` and `q = 5`.
2. **Case Analysis on `p` Modulo 3**:
   - We consider the possible residues of `p` modulo 3 (0, 1, 2) and check the implications for `q` and `pq - 2`.
   - By eliminating possibilities, we find that `p` must be 3.
3. **Case Analysis on `q` Modulo 5**:
   - Since `q = p + 2` and `p = 3`, we have `q = 5`.
   - We verify that `3 * 5 - 2 = 13`, which is prime.
4. **Conclusion**: The only solution is `p = 3` and `q = 5`.

### Normal Language Explanation
1. **Twin Primes**: Primes `p` and `q` such that `q = p + 2`.
2. **Condition**: `pq - 2` must also be prime.
3. **Verification**:
   - Check small primes:
     - `p = 3`, `q = 5`: `3 * 5 - 2 = 13` (prime).
     - No other small primes satisfy the condition.
4. **Uniqueness**: The pair `(3, 5)` is the only solution.

### Final Answer
The only twin primes `(p, q)` such that `pq - 2` is also prime are `(3, 5)`.
