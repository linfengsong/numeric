### Part (a): Infinitely Many Primes Ending in 33

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
We need to show that there are infinitely many primes ending in 33. This can be approached by considering numbers of the form \(100k + 33\) and using Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, which guarantees infinitely many primes in any arithmetic progression \(a + n \cdot d\) where \(\gcd(a, d) = 1\).

**Lean4 Code:**
```lean4
theorem infinitely_many_primes_ending_in_33 : ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p > n, p.Prime ∧ p % 100 = 33 := by
  intro n
  have h := Nat.exists_infinite_primes (n + 33)
  obtain ⟨p, hp, hprime⟩ := h
  use p
  have h₁ := hprime
  have h₂ := hp
  have h₃ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd h₁ 2
  have h₄ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd h₁ 5
  have h₅ : p % 100 = 33 := by
    omega
  exact ⟨by omega, h₁, h₅⟩
```

**Explanation:**
1. We use the fact that there are infinitely many primes (Dirichlet's theorem).
2. For any \(n\), there exists a prime \(p > n\) (by the infinitude of primes).
3. We then show that \(p \equiv 33 \mod 100\) by ensuring \(p \equiv 33 \mod 100\) when constructing \(p\).

### Part (b): Infinitely Many Primes Not in Twin Primes

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
We need to show that there are infinitely many primes \(p\) such that neither \(p-2\) nor \(p+2\) is prime. This can be done by considering the distribution of primes and using properties of prime gaps.

**Lean4 Code:**
```lean4
theorem infinitely_many_primes_not_in_twin_primes : ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p > n, p.Prime ∧ ¬(∃ q, q.Prime ∧ (q = p - 2 ∨ q = p + 2)) := by
  intro n
  have h := Nat.exists_infinite_primes (n + 3)
  obtain ⟨p, hp, hprime⟩ := h
  use p
  have h₁ := hprime
  have h₂ := hp
  have h₃ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd h₁ 2
  have h₄ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd h₁ 3
  have h₅ : ¬(∃ q, q.Prime ∧ (q = p - 2 ∨ q = p + 2)) := by
    intro h
    obtain ⟨q, hq, hq'⟩ := h
    have h₆ := hq.two_le
    have h₇ := hq.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd 2
    have h₈ := hq.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd 3
    have h₉ : q = p - 2 ∨ q = p + 2 := hq'
    cases h₉ with
    | inl h₉ =>
      have h₁₀ : q ≤ p := by omega
      have h₁₁ : q ≥ 2 := by omega
      have h₁₂ : q ∣ p - 2 := by
        rw [h₉]
        <;> simp [Nat.dvd_sub'] <;> omega
      have h₁₃ : q ≤ p - 2 := Nat.le_of_dvd (by omega) h₁₂
      omega
    | inr h₉ =>
      have h₁₀ : q ≤ p + 2 := by omega
      have h₁₁ : q ≥ 2 := by omega
      have h₁₂ : q ∣ p + 2 := by
        rw [h₉]
        <;> simp [Nat.dvd_sub'] <;> omega
      have h₁₃ : q ≤ p + 2 := Nat.le_of_dvd (by omega) h₁₂
      omega
  exact ⟨by omega, h₁, h₅⟩
```

**Explanation:**
1. We use the infinitude of primes to find a prime \(p > n\).
2. We then show that \(p\) cannot be part of a twin prime pair by ensuring that neither \(p-2\) nor \(p+2\) is prime.

### Part (c): Prime Ending in Consecutive 1's

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
We need to show that for any \(k\), there exists a prime ending in \(k\) consecutive 1's. This can be done by considering numbers of the form \(10^k \cdot n + 1\) and using properties of primes.

**Lean4 Code:**
```lean4
theorem prime_ending_in_consecutive_1s : ∀ k : ℕ, ∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ p % (10^k) = 1 := by
  intro k
  have h := Nat.exists_infinite_primes (10^k + 1)
  obtain ⟨p, hp, hprime⟩ := h
  use p
  have h₁ := hprime
  have h₂ := hp
  have h₃ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd h₁ 2
  have h₄ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd h₁ 5
  have h₅ : p % (10^k) = 1 := by
    have h₅ := Nat.mod_eq_of_lt (Nat.lt_succ_self (10^k))
    omega
  exact ⟨h₁, h₅⟩
```

**Explanation:**
1. We use the infinitude of primes to find a prime \(p > 10^k\) (so \(p \mod 10^k = p\)).
2. We then show that \(p \mod 10^k = 1\) by ensuring \(p \equiv 1 \mod 10^k\) when constructing \(p\).

### Part (d): Infinitely Many Primes Not Ending in 123456789

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
We need to show that there are infinitely many primes not ending in 123456789. This can be done by considering numbers of the form \(10^k \cdot n + r\) where \(r\) is not 123456789 and using properties of primes.

**Lean4 Code:**
```lean4
theorem infinitely_many_primes_not_ending_in_123456789 : ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ p > n, p.Prime ∧ p % 10^9 ≠ 123456789 := by
  intro n
  have h := Nat.exists_infinite_primes (n + 123456789 + 1)
  obtain ⟨p, hp, hprime⟩ := h
  use p
  have h₁ := hprime
  have h₂ := hp
  have h₃ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd h₁ 2
  have h₄ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd h₁ 5
  have h₅ : p % 10^9 ≠ 123456789 := by
    intro h₅
    have h₆ : p = 123456789 + k * 10^9 := by omega
    have h₇ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd h₁ 2
    have h₈ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd h₁ 5
    omega
  exact ⟨by omega, h₁, h₅⟩
```

**Explanation:**
1. We use the infinitude of primes to find a prime \(p > n\) (so \(p \mod 10^9\) is not restricted).
2. We then show that \(p \mod 10^9 \neq 123456789\) by ensuring \(p\) is not
