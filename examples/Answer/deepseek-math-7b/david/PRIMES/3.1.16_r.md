### Explanation

1. **Forward Direction (→)**:
   - Assume `n` is square-free. We need to show that `n` can be factored into distinct primes.
   - Use the fact that `n` is square-free to deduce that its prime factors must be distinct.
   - This is straightforward because the definition of square-free implies that no prime factor appears more than once in the factorization of `n`.

2. **Backward Direction (←)**:
   - Assume `n` can be factored into distinct primes. We need to show that `n` is square-free.
   - If `n` had a prime factor `p` squared, then `p` would appear twice in its factorization, contradicting the distinctness of the primes.
   - This is the contrapositive of the forward direction.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **Forward Direction**:
   - If `n` is square-free, then by definition, no prime squared divides `n`. This means that all prime factors of `n` must be distinct.
   - Therefore, `n` can be written as a product of distinct primes.

2. **Backward Direction**:
   - If `n` can be factored into distinct primes, then no prime squared divides `n`.
   - This is because if a prime squared divided `n`, it would imply that the prime appears at least twice in the factorization of `n`, which contradicts the distinctness of the primes.
   - Hence, `n` is square-free.

### Final Answer

The proof is complete by showing the equivalence between the square-free property and the factorization into distinct primes. The Lean4 code formalizes this equivalence, and the normal language explanation provides a clear understanding of the proof.
