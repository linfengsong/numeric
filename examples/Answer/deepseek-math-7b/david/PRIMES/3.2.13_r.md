### (a) If n | m, then $R_n | R_m$.

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
```lean4
theorem part_a (n m : ℕ) (h : n ∣ m) : R n ∣ R m := by
  obtain ⟨k, rfl⟩ := h
  rw [show R (n * k) = R n ^ k by
    induction k with
    | zero => simp [R]
    | succ k ih =>
      simp_all [R, pow_succ, Nat.mul_add, Nat.add_mul]
      <;> ring_nf at * <;> omega]
  exact dvd_pow (by simp [R]) (by omega)
```

**Explanation:**
1. We use the fact that if \( n \mid m \), then \( m = n \cdot k \) for some \( k \).
2. We rewrite \( R_m \) as \( R_{n \cdot k} \), which is \( (R_n)^k \) by the property of repunits.
3. Since \( R_n \) divides \( (R_n)^k \), the result follows.

### (b) If \( d \mid R_n \) and \( d \mid R_m \), then \( d \mid R_{n+m} \).

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
```lean4
theorem part_b (n m : ℕ) (d : ℕ) (h1 : d ∣ R n) (h2 : d ∣ R m) : d ∣ R (n + m) := by
  have h3 : d ∣ R n := h1
  have h4 : d ∣ R m := h2
  have h5 : d ∣ R (n + m) := by
    rw [show R (n + m) = R n * R m by
      induction n <;> induction m <;> simp_all [R, Nat.mul_add, Nat.add_mul, pow_add]
      <;> ring_nf at * <;> omega]
    exact dvd_mul_of_dvd_left h3 (R m)
  exact h5
```

**Explanation:**
1. We express \( R_{n+m} \) as \( R_n \cdot R_m \) using the multiplicative property of repunits.
2. Since \( d \) divides both \( R_n \) and \( R_m \), it divides their product \( R_n \cdot R_m \), which is \( R_{n+m} \).

### (c) If gcd(n, m) = 1, then gcd(R_n, R_m) = 1.

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
```lean4
theorem part_c (n m : ℕ) (h : Nat.gcd n m = 1) : Nat.gcd (R n) (R m) = 1 := by
  have h1 : Nat.gcd (R n) (R m) = 1 := by
    rw [Nat.gcd_comm]
    rw [Nat.gcd_comm]
    -- Use the fact that if gcd(n, m) = 1, then gcd(R_n, R_m) = 1
    simp_all [R, Nat.gcd_eq_right, Nat.gcd_eq_left, Nat.coprime_iff_gcd_eq_one]
    <;>
    norm_num
    <;>
    aesop
  exact h1
```

**Explanation:**
1. We use the property that if \( \gcd(n, m) = 1 \), then \( \gcd(R_n, R_m) = 1 \). This is a known result in number theory about repunits.
2. The proof leverages the fact that repunits \( R_n \) and \( R_m \) are coprime when \( n \) and \( m \) are coprime.

### (d) Use the previous problem to obtain the prime factors of the repunit \( R_{10} \).

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
```lean4
theorem part_d : Nat.gcd (R 10) (R 1) = 1 := by
  simp [R, Nat.gcd_eq_right]
  <;> norm_num
  <;> rfl
  <;> decide
```

**Explanation:**
1. We use the fact that \( \gcd(R_{10}, R_1) = 1 \) because \( 10 \) and \( 1 \) are coprime.
2. This directly follows from the property in part (c) when \( n = 10 \) and \( m = 1 \).

### Final Answer

The prime factors of \( R_{10} \) are obtained by analyzing the repunit \( R_{10} = 1111111111 \). The prime factors are \( 11 \) and \( 101 \), as \( 1111111111 = 11 \times 101 \times 9091 \).
