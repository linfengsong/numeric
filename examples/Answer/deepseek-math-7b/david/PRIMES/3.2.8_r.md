### Explanation

The Lean4 proof assumes that there are only finitely many primes and constructs a number \( N \) that is not divisible by any of these primes, leading to a contradiction. The `norm_num` tactic is used to simplify numerical expressions, and the `contradiction` tactic is used to conclude the proof by showing that the assumptions lead to a false statement.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **Assumption**: Assume there are only finitely many primes, say \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \).
2. **Construct \( N \)**: Define \( N \) as the sum of products of all primes except each prime in turn. For example, \( N = p_2p_3 \ldots p_n + p_1p_3 \ldots p_n + \ldots + p_1p_2 \ldots p_{n-1} \).
3. **Divisibility Check**:
   - \( N \) is not divisible by \( p_1 \) because \( N \) does not include \( p_1 \) in its product.
   - Similarly, \( N \) is not divisible by any \( p_i \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, n \).
4. **Contradiction**: Since \( N \) is not divisible by any of the assumed primes, \( N \) must be a new prime or a product of new primes. This contradicts the assumption that the list \( p_1, \ldots, p_n \) is complete.

Thus, the assumption that there are finitely many primes is false, proving the infinitude of primes.
