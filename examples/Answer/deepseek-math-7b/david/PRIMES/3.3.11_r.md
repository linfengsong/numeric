### Explanation
1. **Identify the smallest \( n \) for \( f(n) = n^2 + n + 17 \)**:
   - We need to find the smallest \( n > 0 \) such that \( f(n) \) is composite.
   - We test values of \( n \) starting from 1 until we find the smallest \( n \) where \( f(n) \) is composite.
   - For \( n = 15 \), \( f(15) = 15^2 + 15 + 17 = 225 + 15 + 17 = 257 \).
   - \( 257 \) is not a prime number (it is divisible by 17).
   - Thus, \( n = 15 \) is the smallest positive integer for which \( f(n) \) is composite.

2. **Identify the smallest \( n \) for \( g(n) = n^2 + 21n + 1 \)**:
   - We need to find the smallest \( n > 0 \) such that \( g(n) \) is composite.
   - For \( n = 1 \), \( g(1) = 1 + 21 + 1 = 23 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 2 \), \( g(2) = 4 + 42 + 1 = 47 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 3 \), \( g(3) = 9 + 63 + 1 = 73 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 4 \), \( g(4) = 16 + 84 + 1 = 101 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 5 \), \( g(5) = 25 + 105 + 1 = 131 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 6 \), \( g(6) = 36 + 126 + 1 = 163 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 7 \), \( g(7) = 49 + 147 + 1 = 197 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 8 \), \( g(8) = 64 + 168 + 1 = 233 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 9 \), \( g(9) = 81 + 189 + 1 = 271 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 10 \), \( g(10) = 100 + 210 + 1 = 311 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 11 \), \( g(11) = 121 + 231 + 1 = 353 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 12 \), \( g(12) = 144 + 252 + 1 = 397 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 13 \), \( g(13) = 169 + 273 + 1 = 443 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 14 \), \( g(14) = 196 + 294 + 1 = 491 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 15 \), \( g(15) = 225 + 315 + 1 = 541 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 16 \), \( g(16) = 256 + 336 + 1 = 593 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 17 \), \( g(17) = 289 + 357 + 1 = 647 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 18 \), \( g(18) = 324 + 378 + 1 = 703 \).
     - \( 703 = 19 \times 37 \), so it is composite.
   - Thus, \( n = 18 \) is the smallest positive integer for which \( g(n) \) is composite.

3. **Identify the smallest \( n \) for \( h(n) = 3n^2 + 3n + 23 \)**:
   - We need to find the smallest \( n > 0 \) such that \( h(n) \) is composite.
   - For \( n = 1 \), \( h(1) = 3 + 3 + 23 = 29 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 2 \), \( h(2) = 12 + 6 + 23 = 41 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 3 \), \( h(3) = 27 + 9 + 23 = 59 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 4 \), \( h(4) = 48 + 12 + 23 = 83 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 5 \), \( h(5) = 75 + 15 + 23 = 113 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 6 \), \( h(6) = 108 + 18 + 23 = 149 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 7 \), \( h(7) = 147 + 21 + 23 = 191 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 8 \), \( h(8) = 192 + 24 + 23 = 239 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 9 \), \( h(9) = 243 + 27 + 23 = 293 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 10 \), \( h(10) = 300 + 30 + 23 = 353 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 11 \), \( h(11) = 363 + 33 + 23 = 419 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 12 \), \( h(12) = 432 + 36 + 23 = 491 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 13 \), \( h(13) = 507 + 39 + 23 = 569 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 14 \), \( h(14) = 588 + 42 + 23 = 653 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 15 \), \( h(15) = 675 + 45 + 23 = 743 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 16 \), \( h(16) = 768 + 48 + 23 = 839 \), which is prime.
   - For \( n = 17 \), \( h(17) = 867 + 51 + 23 = 941 \).
     - \( 941 = 23 \times 41 \), so it is composite.
   - Thus, \( n = 17 \) is the smallest positive integer for which \( h(n) \) is composite.
