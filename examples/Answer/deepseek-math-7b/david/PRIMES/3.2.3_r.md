### Explanation
1. **Case Check for Primality**:
   - First, check if `n` is prime. If it is, the result is trivially true.
2. **Case for Composite `n`**:
   - Assume `n` is not prime. We need to show that `n` is the product of two primes.
3. **Divisibility Check for Small Primes**:
   - For each prime `p ≤ sqrt(n)`, check that `p` does not divide `n`.
4. **Constructing the Product of Two Primes**:
   - If `n` is not prime and no prime `p ≤ sqrt(n)` divides `n`, then `n` must be the product of two primes.
   - This is because if `n` were not the product of two primes, it would have a prime factor `p ≤ sqrt(n)`, contradicting the given condition.

### Normal Language Proof
1. **Primality Check**:
   - If `n` is prime, the result is immediate.
2. **Composite Case**:
   - Assume `n` is not prime. We need to show `n` is the product of two primes.
3. **Divisibility Condition**:
   - For all primes `p ≤ sqrt(n)`, `p` does not divide `n`.
4. **Constructing the Product**:
   - If `n` is not prime and no prime `p ≤ sqrt(n)` divides `n`, then `n` must be the product of two primes.
   - This is because if `n` were not the product of two primes, it would have a prime factor `p ≤ sqrt(n)`, contradicting the given condition.
