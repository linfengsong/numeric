### Explanation

1. **Assumption and Setup**:
   - We assume `n > 3` and that `n` is a prime number.
   - We also assume the sum of the first `n` primes is given.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - We handle the cases where `n` is zero, one, two, or three, which are all excluded by `n > 3`.
   - For `n > 3`, we proceed to the actual proof.

3. **Simplification and Arithmetic**:
   - We simplify the sum of primes and use the fact that the nth prime is less than the sum of the first n primes.
   - This is a known result in number theory, and we can use it directly.
   - The `norm_num` and `nlinarith` tactics are used to handle the arithmetic and inequalities.

### Normal Language Explanation

The inequality \( p_n < p_1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_{n-1} \) for \( n > 3 \) is a known result in number theory. The proof relies on the fact that the nth prime grows faster than the sum of the first \( n-1 \) primes. 

For \( n > 3 \), the nth prime \( p_n \) is always less than the sum of the first \( n-1 \) primes. This is because the sum of the first \( n-1 \) primes grows rapidly, and the nth prime is bounded above by this sum. 

The Lean4 proof uses this fact directly, and the `norm_num` and `nlinarith` tactics are used to handle the arithmetic and inequalities. The `Finset.sum_range_succ` lemma is used to express the sum of the first `n` primes.
