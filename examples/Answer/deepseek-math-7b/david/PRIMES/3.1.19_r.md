### Explanation

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - A positive integer \( n \) is square-full if for every prime \( p \) dividing \( n \), \( p^2 \) also divides \( n \).
   - We need to show that any square-full number \( n \) can be expressed in the form \( n = a^2 \cdot b^3 \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers.

2. **Proof Sketch**:
   - The key idea is to factorize \( n \) into its prime powers and then group the primes into two sets: one for the \( a^2 \) part and the other for the \( b^3 \) part.
   - For each prime \( p \) dividing \( n \), the exponent of \( p \) in \( n \) must be at least 2 (since \( n \) is square-full).
   - We can assign half of the exponent of each prime to \( a \) and the other half to \( b \), ensuring that the exponents in \( a \) and \( b \) are even and odd, respectively.
   - This ensures that \( n = a^2 \cdot b^3 \).

3. **Lean4 Proof**:
   - We start by assuming the given condition `hn` that for every prime `p` dividing `n`, `p^2` divides `n`.
   - We then directly construct `a` and `b` such that `n = a^2 * b^3`. Specifically, we set `a = n` and `b = 1`, which simplifies the equation to `n = n^2 * 1^3`, but this is incorrect. Instead, we need to carefully construct `a` and `b` based on the prime factorization of `n`.
   - The correct approach is to use the fact that for each prime `p` dividing `n`, the exponent of `p` in `n` is at least 2. We can then group the exponents into two sets: one for `a` and one for `b`.
   - The `aesop` tactic is used to automatically solve the problem by applying known lemmas and simplifications, but in this case, it is not sufficient to directly construct `a` and `b`. Instead, we need to use the `use` tactic to provide the correct values of `a` and `b`.
   - The `use` tactic is used to provide the values `a = n` and `b = 1`, but this is incorrect. Instead, we need to provide the correct values based on the prime factorization of `n`.
   - The correct values are `a = 1` and `b = n`, but this is also incorrect. The correct values are `a = 1` and `b = 1`, but this is trivial and does not work.
