### Explanation
1. **Identify \( p = 3 \)**:
   - We first show that \( p \) must be 3 by examining the possible residues of \( p \) modulo 3.
   - This is done by checking the divisibility conditions for primes 3 and 5, and considering the possible residues of \( p \) modulo 3.
   - The only solution is \( p = 3 \).

2. **Substitute \( p = 3 \)**:
   - Substitute \( p = 3 \) into \( p^3 + 4 \) to get \( 3^3 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31 \), which is prime.

3. **Verify \( p^3 + 4 \) is prime**:
   - Direct computation shows that \( 31 \) is prime.

### Normal Language Explanation
1. **Identify \( p = 3 \)**:
   - We know that \( p \) is a prime number. We also know that \( p^2 + 8 \) is prime.
   - We consider the possible residues of \( p \) modulo 3.
   - If \( p \equiv 0 \mod 3 \), then \( p = 3 \) (since 3 is the only prime divisible by 3).
   - If \( p \equiv 1 \mod 3 \), then \( p^2 + 8 \equiv 1 + 8 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \), which contradicts \( p^2 + 8 \) being prime (since 3 divides \( p^2 + 8 \)).
   - If \( p \equiv 2 \mod 3 \), then \( p^2 + 8 \equiv 4 + 8 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \), which is consistent. However, we need to check if \( p^3 + 4 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \), which would make \( p^3 + 4 \) divisible by 3 and not prime unless \( p^3 + 4 = 3 \), which is impossible for \( p \geq 2 \).
   - The only consistent case is \( p \equiv 0 \mod 3 \), i.e., \( p = 3 \).

2. **Substitute \( p = 3 \)**:
   - Substitute \( p = 3 \) into \( p^3 + 4 \):
     \[
     3^3 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31
     \]
   - Check that 31 is prime.

3. **Verify \( p^3 + 4 \) is prime**:
   - 31 is a prime number.

### Conclusion
The only prime \( p \) for which both \( p \) and \( p^2 + 8 \) are prime is \( p = 3 \). Substituting \( p = 3 \) into \( p^3 + 4 \) gives 31, which is prime. Thus, \( p^3 + 4 \) is prime.
