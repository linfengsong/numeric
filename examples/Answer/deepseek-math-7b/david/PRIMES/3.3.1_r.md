### Explanation
1. **Verify 1949 is prime**:
   - `norm_num [Nat.Prime]` is a tactic that checks the primality of a number by performing numerical normalization and applying known primality tests.
   - `1949` is a prime number, as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Verify 1951 is prime**:
   - Similarly, `norm_num [Nat.Prime]` confirms that `1951` is a prime number.
   - `1951` is a prime number, as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

3. **Verify the difference**:
   - `rfl` is used to confirm that `1951 = 1949 + 2`, which is trivially true by arithmetic.
   - The `norm_num` tactic is used again to ensure the arithmetic is correct.

### Normal Language Explanation
Twin primes are pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2. For example, (3, 5), (5, 7), (17, 19), etc. The pair (1949, 1951) is a twin prime pair because:
- 1949 is a prime number.
- 1951 is a prime number.
- The difference between 1951 and 1949 is 2.

To verify this:
1. Check that 1949 is prime:
   - 1949 is not divisible by any prime number less than its square root (approximately 44.15).
   - The prime numbers less than 44 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43.
   - None of these divide 1949 without leaving a remainder, so 1949 is prime.

2. Check that 1951 is prime:
   - 1951 is not divisible by any prime number less than its square root (approximately 44.15).
   - The same list of primes is checked, and none divide 1951, so 1951 is prime.

3. Check the difference:
   - 1951 - 1949 = 2, so the pair is a twin prime.
