### Lean4 Proof

```lean4
theorem five_solutions_to_prime_gap_equation : 
  ∃ (n : ℕ), n ≤ 5 ∧ (p (n + 1) - p n) = (p (n + 2) - p (n + 1)) := by
  use 0
  constructor
  norm_num
  norm_num [p]
  <;> decide
  <;> use 1
  <;> constructor
  <;> norm_num
  <;> decide
  <;> use 2
  <;> constructor
  <;> norm_num
  <;> decide
  <;> use 3
  <;> constructor
  <;> norm_num
  <;> decide
  <;> use 4
  <;> constructor
  <;> norm_num
  <;> decide
```

### Explanation

The Lean4 proof uses the first five natural numbers (`0, 1, 2, 3, 4`) as potential solutions. For each `n`, it checks that the gap between consecutive primes is the same for `n` and `n+1`. The `norm_num` tactic is used to compute the values of the prime numbers and their differences, and `decide` is used to verify the arithmetic.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **n = 0**:
   - `p(1) = 3`
   - `p(0) = 2`
   - `p(1) - p(0) = 3 - 2 = 1`
   - `p(2) = 5`
   - `p(1) = 3`
   - `p(2) - p(1) = 5 - 3 = 2`
   - `1 ≠ 2`, so this is not a solution.

2. **n = 1**:
   - `p(2) = 5`
   - `p(1) = 3`
   - `p(2) - p(1) = 2`
   - `p(3) = 7`
   - `p(2) = 5`
   - `p(3) - p(2) = 2`
   - `2 = 2`, so this is a solution.

3. **n = 2**:
   - `p(3) = 7`
   - `p(2) = 5`
   - `p(3) - p(2) = 2`
   - `p(4) = 11`
   - `p(3) = 7`
   - `p(4) - p(3) = 4`
   - `2 ≠ 4`, so this is not a solution.

4. **n = 3**:
   - `p(4) = 11`
   - `p(3) = 7`
   - `p(4) - p(3) = 4`
   - `p(5) = 13`
   - `p(4) = 11`
   - `p(5) - p(4) = 2`
   - `4 ≠ 2`, so this is not a solution.

5. **n = 4**:
   - `p(5) = 13`
   - `p(4) = 11`
   - `p(5) - p(4) = 2`
   - `p(6) = 17`
   - `p(5) = 13`
   - `p(6) - p(5) = 4`
   - `2 ≠ 4`, so this is not a solution.

Thus, the only solution among the first five natural numbers is `n = 1`.

### Corrected Lean4 Proof

```lean4
theorem five_solutions_to_prime_gap_equation : 
  ∃ (n : ℕ), n ≤ 5 ∧ (p (n + 1) - p n) = (p (n + 2) - p (n + 1)) := by
  use 1
  constructor
  norm_num
  norm_num [p]
  <;> decide
```

### Explanation

The corrected proof uses `n = 1` as the only solution among the first five natural numbers. The `norm_num` tactic is used to compute the values of the prime numbers and their differences, and `decide` is used to verify the arithmetic. The `p` function is defined elsewhere in the Lean4 code to represent the sequence of prime numbers.
