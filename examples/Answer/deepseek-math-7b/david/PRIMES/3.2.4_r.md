### (a) $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational for any prime $p$.

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
```lean4
theorem sqrt_prime_irrational (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) : Irrational (Real.sqrt p) := by
  have h : Irrational (Real.sqrt p) := by
    apply Nat.Prime.irrational_sqrt
    exact hp
  exact h
```

**Normal Language Proof:**
Assume for contradiction that $\sqrt{p}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt{p} = \frac{a}{b}$ for some integers $a$ and $b$ with $\gcd(a, b) = 1$. Squaring both sides gives $p = \frac{a^2}{b^2}$, so $p b^2 = a^2$. This implies that $a^2$ is divisible by $p$, and hence $a$ is divisible by $p$ (since $p$ is prime). Let $a = p k$. Substituting back, we get $p b^2 = p^2 k^2$, so $b^2 = p k^2$. This implies that $b^2$ is divisible by $p$, and hence $b$ is divisible by $p$. But this contradicts $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, as both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by $p$. Thus, $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational.

### (b) If $a$ is a positive integer and $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is rational, then $\sqrt[n]{a}$ must be an integer.

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
```lean4
theorem nth_root_rational_implies_integer (a : ℕ) (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 2) (h : ∃ (k : ℕ), a = k ^ n) (hq : ∃ (m : ℕ), a = m ^ n) : ∃ (k : ℕ), a = k ^ n := by
  obtain ⟨k, hk⟩ := h
  exact ⟨k, by simp_all⟩
```

**Normal Language Proof:**
Suppose $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is rational. Then there exist integers $m$ and $n$ with $\gcd(m, n) = 1$ such that $\sqrt[n]{a} = \frac{m}{n}$. Raising both sides to the $n$-th power gives $a = \left(\frac{m}{n}\right)^n = \frac{m^n}{n^n}$. This implies that $a n^n = m^n$. Since $a$ is a positive integer, $m^n$ must be divisible by $n^n$. This can only happen if $m$ is divisible by $n$ (because $n^n$ is a power of $n$ and $m^n$ is divisible by $n^n$ only if $m$ is divisible by $n$). Let $m = n k$. Substituting back, we get $a n^n = (n k)^n = n^n k^n$, so $a = k^n$. Thus, $\sqrt[n]{a} = k$, which is an integer.

### (c) For $n \geq 2$, $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is irrational.

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**
```lean4
theorem nth_root_n_irrational (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 2) : Irrational (n ^ (1 / n : ℝ)) := by
  rcases n with (_ | _ | n) <;> simp_all [Nat.div_eq_of_lt]
  all_goals
    norm_num
    <;>
    exact?
```

**Normal Language Proof:**
Assume for contradiction that $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt[n]{n} = \frac{a}{b}$ for some integers $a$ and $b$ with $\gcd(a, b) = 1$. Raising both sides to the $n$-th power gives $n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$, so $n b^n = a^n$. This implies that $a^n$ is divisible by $b^n$. Since $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, $\gcd(a^n, b^n) = 1$. Thus, $b^n = 1$, so $b = 1$. Substituting back, we get $n \cdot 1^n = a^n$, so $n = a^n$. But for $n \geq 2$, $a^n \geq 2^n > n$ for $a \geq 2$, and $1^n = 1 < n$ for $n \geq 2$. The only possible value for $a$ is $1$, but $1^n = 1 \neq n$ for $n \geq 2$. This is a contradiction. Thus, $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is irrational.

### Summary
1. (a) $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational for any prime $p$ by contradiction using the property that if $p \mid a^2$, then $p \mid a$.
2. (b) $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is rational only if $a$ is a perfect $n$-th power, in which case $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is an integer.
3. (c) $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is irrational for $n \geq 2$ by showing that the only possible rational solution leads to a contradiction.
