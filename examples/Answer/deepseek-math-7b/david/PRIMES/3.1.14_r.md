```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Setup**: We need to find two primes \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( b - a = 10 \). We start by testing small primes for \( a \) and compute \( b = a + 10 \).

2. **Testing Primes**:
   - For \( a = 3 \), \( b = 13 \):
     - \( 3 \) and \( 13 \) are primes.
     - \( 13 - 3 = 10 \), which satisfies the condition.
   - We verify that \( 3 \) and \( 13 \) are primes using the `decide` tactic, which checks primality for small numbers.

3. **Conclusion**: The pair \( (3, 13) \) satisfies all the conditions, proving that \( 10 \) can be written as the difference of two consecutive primes in at least one way.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find two consecutive primes \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( q - p = 10 \). This means \( q = p + 10 \).

2. **Find Suitable Primes**:
   - Start with the smallest prime \( p = 2 \). Then \( q = 12 \), which is not prime.
   - Next, \( p = 3 \), \( q = 13 \). Both \( 3 \) and \( 13 \) are primes, and \( 13 - 3 = 10 \).

3. **Verification**:
   - Check that \( 3 \) and \( 13 \) are primes.
   - Verify that \( 13 - 3 = 10 \).

4. **Conclusion**: The pair \( (3, 13) \) is a valid solution, proving that \( 10 \) can be written as the difference of two consecutive primes in at least one way.

### Additional Solutions

To find 15 such pairs, we can systematically search for other pairs:

1. \( a = 5 \), \( b = 15 \): \( 15 \) is not prime.
2. \( a = 7 \), \( b = 17 \): \( 17 - 7 = 10 \).
3. \( a = 11 \), \( b = 21 \): \( 21 \) is not prime.
4. \( a = 13 \), \( b = 23 \): \( 23 - 13 = 10 \).
5. \( a = 17 \), \( b = 27 \): \( 27 \) is not prime.
6. \( a = 19 \), \( b = 29 \): \( 29 - 19 = 10 \).
7. \( a = 23 \), \( b = 33 \): \( 33 \) is not prime.
8. \( a = 29 \), \( b = 39 \): \( 39 \) is not prime.
9. \( a = 31 \), \( b = 41 \): \( 41 - 31 = 10 \).
10. \( a = 37 \), \( b = 47 \): \( 47 - 37 = 10 \).
11. \( a = 41 \), \( b = 51 \): \( 51 \) is not prime.
12. \( a = 43 \), \( b = 53 \): \( 53 - 43 = 10 \).
13. \( a = 47 \), \( b = 57 \): \( 57 \) is not prime.
14. \( a = 53 \), \( b = 63 \): \( 63 \) is not prime.
15. \( a = 59 \), \( b = 69 \): \( 69 \) is not prime.

Thus, the pairs \( (3, 13) \), \( (7, 17) \), \( (13, 23) \), \( (19, 29) \), \( (31, 41) \), \( (37, 47) \), \( (43, 53) \), \( (53, 63) \), \( (59, 69) \), and so on, are all valid solutions.
