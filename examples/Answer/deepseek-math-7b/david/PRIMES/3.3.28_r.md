### Part (a): Proving \( n! \) is never a perfect square for \( n \geq 1 \)

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**

```lean4
theorem part_a : ∀ n : ℕ, n ≥ 1 → ¬ (∃ k : ℕ, k^2 = Nat.factorial n) := by
  intro n hn
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨k, hk⟩
  have h₁ : n ≤ 1 := by
    by_contra! h₂
    have h₃ := Nat.factorial_pos n
    have h₄ : k^2 = n ! := by linarith
    have h₅ : k ≤ n ! := by
      nlinarith [Nat.factorial_le (by linarith : n ≤ n)]
    have h₆ : n ! < (n + 1)! := by
      simp [Nat.factorial_succ, Nat.mul_lt_mul_of_pos_right, Nat.factorial_pos, hn]
      <;> nlinarith
    have h₇ : k < (n + 1)! := by
      nlinarith
    have h₈ : k ≥ (n + 1)! := by
      nlinarith [Nat.factorial_le (by linarith : n + 1 ≤ n + 1)]
    nlinarith
  interval_cases n <;> simp_all [Nat.factorial]
  <;> norm_num
  <;> rcases k with (_ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _) <;> norm_num at hk ⊢ <;> ring_nf at hk ⊢ <;> omega
```

**Explanation:**
1. We assume \( n \geq 1 \) and \( n! \) is a perfect square.
2. We show that \( n \leq 1 \) must hold by contradiction.
3. For \( n \leq 1 \), we check \( n! \) is not a perfect square by evaluating \( n! \) for \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \).
4. For \( n \geq 2 \), we use properties of factorials and perfect squares to derive a contradiction.

### Part (b): Finding \( n \geq 1 \) such that \( n! + (n + 1)! + (n + 2)! \) is a perfect square

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**

```lean4
theorem part_b : ∀ n : ℕ, n ≥ 1 → (∃ k : ℕ, k^2 = n ! + (n + 1)! + (n + 2)!) → n = 1 := by
  intro n hn h
  rcases h with ⟨k, hk⟩
  have h₁ : n = 1 := by
    by_contra! h₂
    have h₃ := Nat.factorial_pos n
    have h₄ := Nat.factorial_pos (n + 1)
    have h₅ := Nat.factorial_pos (n + 2)
    have h₆ : n ! + (n + 1)! + (n + 2)! > k^2 := by
      cases n with
      | zero => contradiction
      | succ n =>
        cases n with
        | zero =>
          norm_num [Nat.factorial] at hk ⊢
          <;> ring_nf at hk ⊢ <;>
            (try omega) <;>
            (try
              {
                have : k ≤ 10 := by
                  nlinarith
                interval_cases k <;> norm_num at hk ⊢ <;> omega
              })
        | succ n =>
          simp_all [Nat.factorial_succ, Nat.mul_add, Nat.add_mul]
          <;> nlinarith [Nat.factorial_le (by linarith : n + 1 ≤ n + 1),
            Nat.factorial_le (by linarith : n + 2 ≤ n + 2)]
    nlinarith
  exact h₁
```

**Explanation:**
1. We assume \( n \geq 1 \) and \( n! + (n + 1)! + (n + 2)! \) is a perfect square.
2. We show that \( n = 1 \) is the only solution by contradiction.
3. For \( n \geq 2 \), we derive that the sum is too large to be a perfect square.
4. For \( n = 1 \), we verify that the sum is indeed a perfect square.

### Final Answer

**Part (a):** \( n! \) is never a perfect square for \( n \geq 1 \).

**Part (b):** The only value of \( n \geq 1 \) for which \( n! + (n + 1)! + (n + 2)! \) is a perfect square is \( n = 1 \).
