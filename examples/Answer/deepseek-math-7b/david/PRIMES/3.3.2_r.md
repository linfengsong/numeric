### Part (a): Proving that 1 added to the product of twin primes results in a perfect square.

**Lean4 Proof Sketch:**

```lean4
theorem twin_primes_product_plus_one_square (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hp' : Nat.Prime (p + 2)) : ∃ k, p * (p + 2) + 1 = k ^ 2 := by
  use p + 1
  have h₁ : p * (p + 2) + 1 = (p + 1) ^ 2 := by
    ring
  rw [h₁]
  <;> simp [sq]
  <;> ring
  <;> norm_num
  <;> nlinarith [Nat.Prime.two_le hp, Nat.Prime.two_le hp']
```

**Explanation:**
1. We start by assuming `p` is a prime and `p + 2` is also a prime (i.e., `p` and `p + 2` are twin primes).
2. We need to show that `p * (p + 2) + 1` is a perfect square.
3. We claim that `(p + 1)^2` is the perfect square we are looking for.
4. We verify that `p * (p + 2) + 1 = (p + 1)^2` by expanding and simplifying both sides.
5. The `ring` tactic is used to expand and simplify the expressions, and `norm_num` and `nlinarith` are used to handle the arithmetic and inequalities.

### Part (b): Proving that the sum of twin primes `p` and `p + 2` is divisible by 12, provided that `p > 3`.

  have h₁ : p % 12 = 1 ∨ p % 12 = 5 ∨ p % 12 = 7 ∨ p % 12 = 11 := by
    have h₁ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd hp 2

    have h₁ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd hp' 2
    have h₂ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd hp' 3
    have h₃ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd hp' 4
    have h₄ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd hp' 6
    have h₅ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd hp' 12

```

**Explanation:**
1. We first show that for a prime `p > 3`, `p` must be congruent to 1, 5, 7, or 11 modulo 12. This is because primes greater than 3 cannot be divisible by 2 or 3, and the possible remainders modulo 12 are constrained by this.
2. Similarly, for `p + 2` to be a prime, it must also satisfy the same congruence conditions.
3. We then consider all combinations of these congruences and show that in each case, `p + (p + 2) = 2p + 2` is divisible by 12. This is done by checking each possible pair of congruences and verifying that the sum is divisible by 12.
4. The `omega` tactic is used to solve the resulting arithmetic problems.
