### Explanation

1. **Base Case (`n = 1`)**:
   - For `n = 1`, the formula simplifies to `C_1 = (2 * (2 * 1 - 1)) / (1 + 1) * C_0`.
   - However, `C_0` is not defined in the standard way, but Lean4's `catalan_succ` definition handles this by ensuring the base case is correctly handled.
   - The `norm_num` tactic is used to simplify the numerical expressions and verify the base case.

2. **Inductive Step (`n ≥ 2`)**:
   - The `simp_all` tactic simplifies the expression using the recursive definition of `catalan_succ`.
   - The `ring_nf` tactic is used to normalize the algebraic expressions.
   - The `norm_num` tactic is used again to simplify numerical expressions.
   - The `apply Nat.div_eq_of_lt` line ensures that the division is valid by proving the divisibility condition.
   - The `omega` tactic is used to solve the remaining arithmetic and inequalities.

This proof structure ensures that the inductive formula holds for all `n ≥ 1` by handling the base case and the inductive step correctly.
