### Explanation
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to show that the expression `(2 * n)! / (2 ^ n * n!)` is an integer for all non-negative integers `n`.
2. **Approach**:
   - The numerator `(2 * n)!` is the factorial of `2 * n`, and the denominator is `2 ^ n * n!`.
   - We need to show that the denominator divides the numerator, i.e., `2 ^ n * n!` divides `(2 * n)!`.
   - This is a combinatorial argument: `(2 * n)!` counts the number of ways to arrange `2 * n` distinct objects, and `2 ^ n * n!` counts the number of ways to arrange `2 * n` objects into `n` pairs and then arrange the pairs.
3. **Proof Sketch**:
   - By the definition of factorial, `(2 * n)! = (2 * n) * (2 * n - 1) * ... * (n + 1) * n!`.
   - The term `2 ^ n` in the denominator suggests pairing the terms in the numerator. Specifically, for each `k` from `1` to `n`, the term `2 * k - 1` and `2 * k` are consecutive odd and even numbers, respectively. These can be paired as `(2 * k - 1, 2 * k)`, and since `2 * k - 1` and `2 * k` are consecutive, one of them is even, and the other is odd. Thus, each pair contributes a factor of `2` to the denominator.
   - Therefore, the denominator `2 ^ n * n!` divides the numerator `(2 * n)!`, making the expression an integer.
4. **Lean4 Proof**:
   - We use the fact that `(2 * n)!` is divisible by `2 ^ n * n!` to show that the division results in an integer.
   - The `simp` tactic simplifies the expression, and `ring_nf` normalizes it.
   - `norm_num` and `omega` are used to handle numerical and arithmetic details.

### Normal Language Proof
1. **Combinatorial Interpretation**:
   - The expression `(2 * n)! / (2 ^ n * n!)` counts the number of ways to arrange `2 * n` distinct objects into `n` pairs and then arrange the pairs.
   - Since `(2 * n)!` is the total number of arrangements of `2 * n` distinct objects, and `2 ^ n * n!` is the number of ways to arrange `2 * n` objects into `n` pairs (each pair is indistinguishable), the division gives an integer result.
2. **Pairing Argument**:
   - For each `k` from `1` to `n`, the terms `2 * k - 1` and `2 * k` in the numerator can be paired, contributing a factor of `2` to the denominator.
   - This pairing ensures that the denominator divides the numerator, making the expression an integer.
3. **Conclusion**:
   - The expression `(2 * n)! / (2 ^ n * n!)` is an integer because the denominator divides the numerator.

### Final Answer
The expression `(2 * n)! / (2 ^ n * n!)` is indeed an integer for all non-negative integers `n`.
