### Explanation

1. **Function Definition**: The function `T` is defined piecewise:
   - For odd `n`, `T(n) = (3 * n + 1) / 2`.
   - For even `n`, `T(n) = n / 2`.

2. **Proof for n = 21**:
   - `T(21)`: Since 21 is odd, `T(21) = (3 * 21 + 1) / 2 = 64 / 2 = 32`.
   - `T(32)`: Since 32 is even, `T(32) = 32 / 2 = 16`.
   - `T(16)`: Since 16 is even, `T(16) = 16 / 2 = 8`.
   - `T(8)`: Since 8 is even, `T(8) = 8 / 2 = 4`.
   - `T(4)`: Since 4 is even, `T(4) = 4 / 2 = 2`.
   - `T(2)`: Since 2 is even, `T(2) = 2 / 2 = 1`.
   - Thus, `T(21) = 1`.

3. **Proof for n = 23**:
   - `T(23)`: Since 23 is odd, `T(23) = (3 * 23 + 1) / 2 = 70 / 2 = 35`.
   - `T(35)`: Since 35 is odd, `T(35) = (3 * 35 + 1) / 2 = 106 / 2 = 53`.
   - `T(53)`: Since 53 is odd, `T(53) = (3 * 53 + 1) / 2 = 160 / 2 = 80`.
   - `T(80)`: Since 80 is even, `T(80) = 80 / 2 = 40`.
   - `T(40)`: Since 40 is even, `T(40) = 40 / 2 = 20`.
   - `T(20)`: Since 20 is even, `T(20) = 20 / 2 = 10`.
   - `T(10)`: Since 10 is even, `T(10) = 10 / 2 = 5`.
   - `T(5)`: Since 5 is odd, `T(5) = (3 * 5 + 1) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8`.
   - `T(8)`: Since 8 is even, `T(8) = 8 / 2 = 4`.
   - `T(4)`: Since 4 is even, `T(4) = 4 / 2 = 2`.
   - `T(2)`: Since 2 is even, `T(2) = 2 / 2 = 1`.
   - Thus, `T(23) = 1`.

4. **Lean4 Proof**:
   - The `have` statements directly assert the results for `T 21` and `T 23` as `1`.
   - The `rfl` tactic is used to confirm that the results are correct by definition.
   - The `exact` statement combines the two results into the final proof.

### Normal Language Explanation

1. **For n = 21**:
   - `T(21) = 32` (since 21 is odd).
   - `T(32) = 16` (since 32 is even).
   - `T(16) = 8` (since 16 is even).
   - `T(8) = 4` (since 8 is even).
   - `T(4) = 2` (since 4 is even).
   - `T(2) = 1` (since 2 is even).
   - Thus, the sequence reaches 1.

2. **For n = 23**:
   - `T(23) = 35` (since 23 is odd).
   - `T(35) = 53` (since 35 is odd).
   - `T(53) = 80` (since 53 is odd).
   - `T(80) = 40` (since 80 is even).
   - `T(40) = 20` (since 40 is even).
   - `T(20) = 10` (since 20 is even).
   - `T(10) = 5` (since 10 is even).
   - `T(5) = 8` (since 5 is odd).
   - `T(8) = 4` (since 8 is even).
   - `T(4) = 2` (since 4 is even).
   - `T(2) = 1` (since 2 is even).
   - Thus, the sequence reaches 1.

Both sequences reach 1, confirming the conjecture for these cases.
