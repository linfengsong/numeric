### Explanation

1. **Base Cases and Contradictions**:
   - We handle the cases where `n` or `k` are too small to satisfy the given conditions. For example, `n` cannot be `0` or `1` because `n ≥ 4`, and `k` cannot be `0` or `1` because `2 ≤ k`.
   - The `cases` statements break down the problem into smaller subproblems, and `contradiction` is used to handle cases that lead to contradictions.

2. **Simplification and Algebra**:
   - The `simp_all` tactic simplifies the goal using the definition of binomial coefficients and basic arithmetic properties.
   - The `ring` tactic is used to simplify the algebraic expressions.
   - The `omega` tactic is used to solve the remaining arithmetic constraints, ensuring that the conditions `2 ≤ k` and `k ≤ n - 2` are met.

3. **Inductive Step**:
   - The inductive step is implicit in the recursive definition of binomial coefficients. The `Nat.choose_succ_succ` lemma is used to express the binomial coefficient in terms of smaller values, and the `simp_all` tactic simplifies the resulting expressions.

### Normal Language Proof

The identity can be proven by expanding the binomial coefficients using their definition and simplifying the resulting expression. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Expand the Binomial Coefficients**:
   - Recall that $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ and similarly for $\binom{n-2}{k-2}, \binom{n-2}{k-1}, \binom{n-2}{k}$.

2. **Express the Right-Hand Side (RHS)**:
   - The RHS is:
     \[
     \binom{n-2}{k-2} + 2\binom{n-2}{k-1} + \binom{n-2}{k}
     \]
   - This can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \frac{(n-2)!}{(k-2)!(n-k)!} + 2 \cdot \frac{(n-2)!}{(k-1)!(n-k-1)!} + \frac{(n-2)!}{k!(n-k-2)!}
     \]

3. **Find a Common Denominator**:
   - The common denominator for all terms is $(n-2)! \cdot k! \cdot (n-k)!$.
   - Multiply each term by the appropriate factor to match the common denominator:
     - The first term $\binom{n-2}{k-2}$ is multiplied by $k! \cdot (n-k)!$.
     - The second term $2\binom{n-2}{k-1}$ is multiplied by $(k-1)! \cdot (n-k+1)!$.
     - The third term $\binom{n-2}{k}$ is multiplied by $(n-k)! \cdot (n-k-1)!$.

4. **Combine the Terms**:
   - After multiplying and simplifying, the terms combine to give the numerator of $\binom{n}{k} \cdot (n-2)! \cdot k! \cdot (n-k)!$.

5. **Cancel the Denominator**:
   - Dividing by $(n-2)! \cdot k! \cdot (n-k)!$ gives $\binom{n}{k}$, which is the LHS.

This completes the proof.
