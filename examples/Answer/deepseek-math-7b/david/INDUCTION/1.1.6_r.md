### Explanation

1. **Base Case (`n = 4`)**:
   - We need to show `4! > 4^2`.
   - `4! = 24` and `4^2 = 16`.
   - Clearly, `24 > 16`, so the base case holds.

2. **Inductive Step**:
   - Assume `n! > n^2` for some `n ≥ 4`.
   - We need to show `(n + 1)! > (n + 1)^2`.
   - `(n + 1)! = (n + 1) * n!` and `(n + 1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1`.
   - By the inductive hypothesis, `n! > n^2`, so `(n + 1)! = (n + 1) * n! > (n + 1) * n^2`.
   - We need to show `(n + 1) * n^2 > n^2 + 2n + 1`, which simplifies to `n^3 + n^2 > n^2 + 2n + 1` or `n^3 - 2n - 1 > 0`.
   - For `n ≥ 4`, `n^3` dominates, and the inequality holds.

### Normal Language Proof

1. **Base Case (`n = 4`)**:
   - `4! = 24` and `4^2 = 16`.
   - Clearly, `24 > 16`, so the base case holds.

2. **Inductive Step**:
   - Assume `n! > n^2` for some `n ≥ 4`.
   - We need to show `(n + 1)! > (n + 1)^2`.
   - `(n + 1)! = (n + 1) * n!` and `(n + 1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1`.
   - By the inductive hypothesis, `n! > n^2`, so `(n + 1)! = (n + 1) * n! > (n + 1) * n^2`.
   - We need to show `(n + 1) * n^2 > n^2 + 2n + 1`, which simplifies to `n^3 - 2n - 1 > 0`.
   - For `n ≥ 4`, `n^3` grows much faster than `2n + 1`, so the inequality holds.

### Lean4 Proof with `nlinarith`

```lean4
theorem factorial_gt_n_sq (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 4) : n! > n^2 := by
  induction' hn with n hn
  · decide
  · cases n with
    | zero => contradiction
    | succ n =>
      cases n with
      | zero => contradiction
      | succ n =>
        cases n with
        | zero => contradiction
        | succ n =>
          cases n with
          | zero => contradiction
          | succ n =>
            simp_all [Nat.factorial_succ, Nat.pow_succ, Nat.mul_assoc]
            all_goals
              nlinarith [sq_nonneg (n + 1), sq_nonneg (n + 2), sq_nonneg (n + 3),
                sq_nonneg (n + 4), Nat.factorial_pos n, Nat.factorial_pos (n + 1)]
```

### Explanation

- The `nlinarith` tactic is used to handle the linear arithmetic in the inductive step.
- The inequalities are derived from the fact that `n!` grows faster than `n^2` for `n ≥ 4`, and `nlinarith` can handle the necessary arithmetic simplifications and inequalities.
