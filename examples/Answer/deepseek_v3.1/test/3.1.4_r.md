I will first prove this statement mathematically and then write a Lean 4 proof.

**Mathematical Proof:**

Let p ≥ 5 be a prime number. Consider p² + 2 modulo 3.

Since p is prime and p ≥ 5, p is not divisible by 3. Therefore:
- p ≡ 1 (mod 3) ⇒ p² ≡ 1 (mod 3) ⇒ p² + 2 ≡ 0 (mod 3)
- p ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⇒ p² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3) ⇒ p² + 2 ≡ 0 (mod 3)

In both cases, p² + 2 ≡ 0 (mod 3), so 3 divides p² + 2.

Since p ≥ 5, we have p² + 2 > 3, so p² + 2 is composite (it has a proper divisor 3).

**Lean 4 Proof:**

```lean
theorem prime_sq_plus_two_composite (p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (h : p ≥ 5) :
    ¬ Nat.Prime (p ^ 2 + 2) := by
  -- Show that 3 divides p² + 2
  have hdiv : 3 ∣ p ^ 2 + 2 := by
    have hmod : p % 3 = 1 ∨ p % 3 = 2 := by
      have : ¬3 ∣ p := Nat.not_dvd_div_p ?_ ?_ hp
      omega
    rcases hmod with h | h
    · have : p ^ 2 % 3 = 1 := by
        rw [Nat.pow_succ, Nat.mul_mod_right, h, show (1 : ℕ) ^ 2 = 1 by norm_num]
      omega
    · have : p ^ 2 % 3 = 1 := by
        rw [Nat.pow_succ, Nat.mul_mod_right, h, show (2 : ℕ) ^ 2 = 4 by norm_num]
        omega
      omega
  
  -- p² + 2 > 3 since p ≥ 5
  have hgt : p ^ 2 + 2 > 3 := by
    have : p ^ 2 ≥ 25 := by omega
    omega
  
  -- Therefore p² + 2 is not prime (has proper divisor 3)
  exact Nat.not_prime_mul hgt (by omega) hdiv
```

**Output as normal language:**

For any prime number p ≥ 5, the number p² + 2 is always divisible by 3 and greater than 3, making it a composite number (not prime). This is because when we examine primes modulo 3, they can only be congruent to 1 or 2 (since they can't be divisible by 3), and in both cases p² + 2 becomes divisible by 3.
