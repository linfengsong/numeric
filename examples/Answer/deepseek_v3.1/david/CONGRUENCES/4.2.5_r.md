I'll prove these divisibility statements using modular arithmetic and properties of exponents. Let's start with the first one.

### 1. Proving $53^{103} + 103^{53}$ is divisible by 39

Since 39 = 3 × 13, we'll prove divisibility by both 3 and 13.

**Divisibility by 3:**
- 53 ≡ 2 (mod 3) since 53 = 3×17 + 2
- 103 ≡ 1 (mod 3) since 103 = 3×34 + 1
- So: 53¹⁰³ + 103⁵³ ≡ 2¹⁰³ + 1⁵³ ≡ 2¹⁰³ + 1 (mod 3)
- 2 ≡ -1 (mod 3), so 2¹⁰³ ≡ (-1)¹⁰³ ≡ -1 (mod 3)
- Therefore: -1 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3)

**Divisibility by 13:**
- 53 ≡ 1 (mod 13) since 53 = 13×4 + 1
- 103 ≡ 12 ≡ -1 (mod 13) since 103 = 13×7 + 12
- So: 53¹⁰³ + 103⁵³ ≡ 1¹⁰³ + (-1)⁵³ ≡ 1 + (-1) ≡ 0 (mod 13)

Since divisible by both 3 and 13, and 3 and 13 are coprime, the expression is divisible by 39.

### 2. Proving $111^{333} + 333^{111}$ is divisible by 7

**Divisibility by 7:**
- 111 ≡ 6 (mod 7) since 111 = 7×15 + 6
- 333 ≡ 4 (mod 7) since 333 = 7×47 + 4
- So: 111³³³ + 333¹¹¹ ≡ 6³³³ + 4¹¹¹ (mod 7)

Using Euler's theorem (φ(7) = 6):
- 6³ ≡ 6×6×6 ≡ 36×6 ≡ 1×6 ≡ 6 ≡ -1 (mod 7)
- 6⁶ ≡ (6³)² ≡ (-1)² ≡ 1 (mod 7)
- 333 = 6×55 + 3, so 6³³³ ≡ (6⁶)⁵⁵ × 6³ ≡ 1⁵⁵ × (-1) ≡ -1 (mod 7)

Similarly:
- 4³ ≡ 64 ≡ 1 (mod 7) since 64 = 7×9 + 1
- 111 = 3×37, so 4¹¹¹ ≡ (4³)³⁷ ≡ 1³⁷ ≡ 1 (mod 7)

Therefore: -1 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 7)

### Normal Language Output:

I have proven that:
1. **$53^{103} + 103^{53}$ is divisible by 39** because:
   - It is divisible by 3: $53 ≡ 2 \pmod{3}$ and $103 ≡ 1 \pmod{3}$, so $53^{103} + 103^{53} ≡ 2^{103} + 1^{53} ≡ (-1)^{103} + 1 ≡ -1 + 1 ≡ 0 \pmod{3}$
   - It is divisible by 13: $53 ≡ 1 \pmod{13}$ and $103 ≡ -1 \pmod{13}$, so $53^{103} + 103^{53} ≡ 1^{103} + (-1)^{53} ≡ 1 + (-1) ≡ 0 \pmod{13}$

2. **$111^{333} + 333^{111}$ is divisible by 7** because:
   - $111 ≡ 6 \pmod{7}$ and $333 ≡ 4 \pmod{7}$
   - $6^3 ≡ -1 \pmod{7}$, so $6^{333} = (6^3)^{111} ≡ (-1)^{111} ≡ -1 \pmod{7}$
   - $4^3 ≡ 1 \pmod{7}$, so $4^{111} = (4^3)^{37} ≡ 1^{37} ≡ 1 \pmod{7}$
   - Therefore: $-1 + 1 ≡ 0 \pmod{7}$

The Lean proof formalizes these modular arithmetic calculations and confirms both divisibility statements are correct.
