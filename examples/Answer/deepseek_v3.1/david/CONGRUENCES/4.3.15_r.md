Let \( S(n) = 1! + 2! + 3! + \ldots + n! \). We seek all integers \( n \geq 1 \) such that \( S(n) \) is a perfect square.

First, compute small values:
- \( n = 1 \): \( S(1) = 1! = 1 = 1^2 \) (perfect square).
- \( n = 2 \): \( S(2) = 1! + 2! = 1 + 2 = 3 \) (not a perfect square).
- \( n = 3 \): \( S(3) = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 = 3^2 \) (perfect square).
- \( n = 4 \): \( S(4) = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33 \) (not a perfect square).
- \( n = 5 \): \( S(5) = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 + 120 = 153 \) (not a perfect square).
- \( n = 6 \): \( S(6) = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 + 120 + 720 = 873 \) (not a perfect square).
- \( n = 7 \): \( S(7) = 873 + 5040 = 5913 \) (not a perfect square).
- \( n = 8 \): \( S(8) = 5913 + 40320 = 46233 \) (not a perfect square).
- \( n = 9 \): \( S(9) = 46233 + 362880 = 409113 \) (not a perfect square).
- \( n = 10 \): \( S(10) = 409113 + 3628800 = 4037913 \) (not a perfect square).

For \( n \geq 5 \), note that \( n! \) ends with a zero (since \( n! \) for \( n \geq 5 \) contains factors 2 and 5). Therefore, for \( n \geq 5 \), \( S(n) \equiv S(4) = 33 \pmod{100} \). So the last two digits are 33. However, no perfect square ends with 33 (since squares modulo 100 can end with 00, 01, 04, 09, 16, 21, 24, 25, 29, 36, 41, 44, 49, 56, 61, 64, 69, 76, 81, 84, 89, 96, but not 33). Therefore, for \( n \geq 5 \), \( S(n) \) cannot be a perfect square.

Thus, the only values are \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 3 \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{n = 1 \text{ and } n = 3}
\]
are the only values for which \( 1! + 2! + \cdots + n! \) is a perfect square.

**Lean Statement:**
```lean
theorem factorial_sum_perfect_square (n : ℕ) (h : n ≥ 1) : (∑ i in Finset.range (n + 1), Nat.factorial i) = k^2 ↔ n = 1 ∨ n = 3 := by
  -- Proof would involve checking n=1,2,3,4 and then showing for n≥5 the sum ends with 33 modulo 100, which is not a square.
  sorry  -- Actual proof implementation omitted for brevity.
```

**Output in Normal Language:**
The sum \( 1! + 2! + \cdots + n! \) is a perfect square only for \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 3 \). For \( n = 1 \), the sum is \( 1 = 1^2 \), and for \( n = 3 \), the sum is \( 9 = 3^2 \). For all other \( n \geq 2 \), the sum is not a perfect square. In particular, for \( n \geq 5 \), the sum always ends with the digits 33 (modulo 100), and no perfect square ends with 33.
