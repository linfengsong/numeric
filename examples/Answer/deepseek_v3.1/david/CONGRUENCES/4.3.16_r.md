I will prove the statement: "2^n divides an integer N if and only if 2^n divides the number made up of the last n digits of N."

Let me denote:
- N = an arbitrary integer
- L = the number formed by the last n digits of N

I need to prove both directions:
1. If 2^n divides N, then 2^n divides L
2. If 2^n divides L, then 2^n divides N

**Proof:**

Let N be any integer. We can write N in the form:
N = M × 10^n + L, where:
- M is the integer formed by all digits except the last n digits
- L is the integer formed by the last n digits (0 ≤ L < 10^n)

Now, note that 10^n = (2 × 5)^n = 2^n × 5^n, so:
N = M × (2^n × 5^n) + L = 2^n × (M × 5^n) + L

Therefore:
N ≡ L (mod 2^n)

This means N and L leave the same remainder when divided by 2^n.

Now I can prove both directions:

**(⇒) If 2^n divides N, then 2^n divides L:**
If 2^n | N, then N ≡ 0 (mod 2^n)
Since N ≡ L (mod 2^n), we have L ≡ 0 (mod 2^n)
Therefore 2^n divides L

**(⇐) If 2^n divides L, then 2^n divides N:**
If 2^n | L, then L ≡ 0 (mod 2^n)
Since N ≡ L (mod 2^n), we have N ≡ 0 (mod 2^n)
Therefore 2^n divides N

This completes the proof.

**Lean statement:**
```lean

    (2^n) ∣ N ↔ (2^n) ∣ (N % (10^n)) := by
  have h : N ≡ N % (10^n) [MOD (2^n : ℤ)]
  · -- Proof that N ≡ last n digits mod 2^n

  · intro h2

```

**Normal language output:**
This result shows that to check whether 2^n divides a number N, you only need to look at the last n digits of N. For example:
- To check if 4 (2²) divides a number, look at the last 2 digits
- To check if 8 (2³) divides a number, look at the last 3 digits
- To check if 16 (2⁴) divides a number, look at the last 4 digits

This is because when you write N = M × 10^n + L, the term M × 10^n is always divisible by 2^n (since 10^n contains 2^n as a factor), so the divisibility by 2^n depends entirely on whether 2^n divides the last n digits L.
