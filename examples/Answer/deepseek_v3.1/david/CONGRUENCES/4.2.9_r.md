Let \( p \) be a prime such that \( n < p < 2n \). We want to show that \( \binom{2n}{n} \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \).

Recall that:
\[
\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}.
\]
Since \( p \) is a prime and \( n < p < 2n \), \( p \) divides the numerator \((2n)!\) but does not divide the denominator \((n!)^2\). Therefore, \( p \) divides \( \binom{2n}{n} \), i.e., \( \binom{2n}{n} \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \).

**Detailed Explanation:**
- The prime \( p \) satisfies \( n < p < 2n \), so \( p \) appears in the numerator \((2n)!\) (since \( p \leq 2n \)), but does not appear in the denominator \((n!)^2\) (since \( p > n \)).
- Thus, the exponent of \( p \) in \((2n)!\) is at least 1 (in fact, exactly 1 because \( p < 2n < 2p \)), while the exponent in \((n!)^2\) is 0.
- Therefore, \( p \) divides \( \binom{2n}{n} \).

Hence, \( \binom{2n}{n} \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \).

**Lean Statement:**
```lean

    Nat.choose (2 * n) n % p = 0 := by
  have hdiv : p ∣ Nat.choose (2 * n) n := by
    exact Nat.Prime.dvd_choose_self hp.out (by omega) (by omega)
  exact Nat.mod_eq_zero_of_dvd hdiv
```

**Output in Normal Language:**
If \( p \) is a prime number between \( n \) and \( 2n \) (i.e., \( n < p < 2n \)), then the binomial coefficient \( \binom{2n}{n} \) is divisible by \( p \). This is because \( p \) appears in the prime factorization of the numerator \( (2n)! \) but not in the denominator \( (n!)^2 \), leading to \( p \) dividing \( \binom{2n}{n} \). Therefore, \( \binom{2n}{n} \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \).
