Let's analyze the problem step by step:

**ISBN Structure:**
The ISBN-10 (for 9 digits plus check digit) uses the check digit \( a_{10} \) such that:
\[
a_1 + 2a_2 + 3a_3 + \dots + 9a_9 + 10a_{10} \equiv 0 \pmod{11}
\]
But note: the problem states "printing the ISBN \(a_1a_2...a_9\)", which might imply that we are considering the first 9 digits (without the check digit). However, the error is in printing the ISBN (which typically includes the check digit). Actually, the full ISBN-10 is \(a_1a_2...a_{10}\) with \(a_{10}\) being the check digit.

But the problem says: "printing the ISBN \(a_1a_2...a_9\)", which is ambiguous. Given the context, it likely means the entire ISBN (including check digit) is printed, and two digits (which are unequal) were transposed. We are to show that the check digit detects this error.

Wait: Actually, the problem says "printing the ISBN \(a_1a_2...a_9\)". This might be a misstatement: typically ISBN-10 has 10 digits. However, sometimes people refer to the first 9 digits as the "ISBN" and then the check digit is separate. But the error is in printing the ISBN (the first 9 digits) and then the check digit is computed correctly? Actually, the problem says "check digits detected this error", meaning the check digit (which is part of the ISBN) will not match if there is an error.

Clarification: In ISBN-10, the entire code is \(a_1a_2...a_{10}\) with \(a_{10}\) chosen so that the weighted sum is divisible by 11. If two digits are transposed in the printed code (which includes the check digit), we want to show that the check digit will not be correct anymore, i.e., the error is detected.

But note: the problem says "two unequal digits were transposed". So we assume \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) with \(i < j\) and \(a_i \neq a_j\) are swapped.

Let the correct ISBN be \(a_1, a_2, ..., a_{10}\) with:
\[
S = \sum_{k=1}^{10} k a_k \equiv 0 \pmod{11}
\]
After transposing \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) (with \(i < j\)), the new sequence is:
\(b_1, b_2, ..., b_{10}\) where:
\(b_i = a_j\), \(b_j = a_i\), and \(b_k = a_k\) for \(k \neq i,j\).

The new weighted sum is:
\[
S' = \sum_{k=1}^{10} k b_k = S - i a_i - j a_j + i a_j + j a_i = S + (j-i)(a_i - a_j)
\]
Since \(S \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\), we have:
\[
S' \equiv (j-i)(a_i - a_j) \pmod{11}
\]
For the error to go undetected, we need \(S' \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\), i.e.,
\[
(j-i)(a_i - a_j) \equiv 0 \pmod{11}
\]
Since \(a_i \neq a_j\), we have \(a_i - a_j \not\equiv 0 \pmod{11}\) (unless the difference is a multiple of 11, but digits are from 0 to 9, so the only possibility is \(a_i = a_j\), which is excluded). So \(a_i - a_j \not\equiv 0 \pmod{11}\).

Therefore, we need \(j-i \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\). But \(1 \leq i < j \leq 10\), so \(j-i\) is between 1 and 9. Hence, \(j-i \not\equiv 0 \pmod{11}\). Therefore,
\[
(j-i)(a_i - a_j) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{11}
\]
So \(S' \not\equiv 0 \pmod{11}\), meaning the check digit condition fails. Thus, the error is detected.

**Conclusion:** Transposing two unequal digits in an ISBN-10 will always be detected by the check digit.

Now, to write this in Lean:

We need to define the ISBN checksum condition and then show that if we swap two distinct digits (with unequal values) at positions i and j, the new sum is not congruent to 0 mod 11.

Lean statement:

```lean
theorem isbn_error_detection (a : Fin 10 → Fin 11) (h : ∑ k, (k.val + 1 : Fin 11) * a k = 0)
    (i j : Fin 10) (hne : i ≠ j) (hdiff : a i ≠ a j) :
    let b := fun k => if k = i then a j else if k = j then a i else a k in
    ∑ k, (k.val + 1 : Fin 11) * b k ≠ 0 := by
  -- Proof details would go here
```
But note: We are working modulo 11, so we use `Fin 11` for digits? Actually, digits can be 0-9, but the weighted sum is mod 11. Also, positions are from 1 to 10.

Alternatively, we can use integers mod 11.

Actually, in Lean, we might use `ZMod 11`.

Let me formalize:

We have a sequence of digits `a : Fin 10 → ZMod 11` (but digits are actually in `Fin 11`? But digits are only 0-10, with 10 represented as 'X').

However, for the purpose of the check, we can consider the digits as elements of `ZMod 11`.

The condition is: `∑_{k=0}^{9} (k+1) * a k = 0` (if we index from 0).

But positions: usually index from 1 to 10.

So let `a : Fin 10 → ZMod 11` represent the digits, where `a 0` is the first digit, ..., `a 9` is the check digit.

Then the checksum is: `∑_{i=0}^{9} (i+1 : ZMod 11) * a i = 0`.

Now, swap two indices `i` and `j` (with `i ≠ j` and `a i ≠ a j`).

Define `b` as the swapped sequence.

Then the new sum is `S' = ∑_{k} (k+1) * b k`.

We have `S' = S + (j+1)(a i - a j) + (i+1)(a j - a i) = S + (j-i)(a i - a j)`.

Since `S=0`, we have `S' = (j-i)(a i - a j)`.

Since `a i ≠ a j`, `d = a i - a j ≠ 0`.

And `j-i ≠ 0` (as integers, and since `i ≠ j`). But we need modulo 11: note that `j-i` is between -9 and 9, so not divisible by 11. Hence `j-i ≠ 0` in `ZMod 11` (unless `j-i` is multiple of 11, which it isn't). Therefore `S' ≠ 0`.

So in Lean:

```lean
import Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Basic
import Mathlib.Data.ZMod.Basic

open BigOperators

theorem isbn_detects_transposition (a : Fin 10 → ZMod 11) (h : ∑ i : Fin 10, (i.val + 1 : ZMod 11) * a i = 0)
    (i j : Fin 10) (hne : i ≠ j) (hdiff : a i ≠ a j) :
    let b : Fin 10 → ZMod 11 := fun k => if k = i then a j else if k = j then a i else a k
    in ∑ k : Fin 10, (k.val + 1 : ZMod 11) * b k ≠ 0 := by
  intro b
  have swap : b = Function.update (Function.update a i (a j)) j (a i) := by
    ext k; simp [b, ite_def]
  -- Compute the new sum
  have : ∑ k, (k.val + 1 : ZMod 11) * b k = ∑ k, (k.val + 1) * a k + (j.val - i.val) * (a i - a j) := by
    simp [b, Finset.sum_update_of_mem, Finset.sum_update_of_mem, hne, hdiff, mul_sub, sub_mul]
    ring
  rw [this, h, zero_add]
  refine mul_ne_zero ?_ (sub_ne_zero.mpr hdiff)
  intro H
  have : (j.val : ZMod 11) = i.val := by simpa using H
  have : j = i := by
    apply Fin.ext; simp [this]
  contradiction
```

This is a sketch. We might need to adjust the proof steps.

**Output in normal language:**
The ISBN-10 check digit is computed such that the weighted sum of the digits (with weights 1 to 10) is divisible by 11. If two unequal digits are transposed, the change in the weighted sum is \((j-i)(a_i - a_j) \mod 11\), where \(i\) and \(j\) are the positions (with \(i < j\)) and \(a_i, a_j\) are the digits. Since \(a_i \neq a_j\), \(a_i - a_j \not\equiv 0 \mod 11\). Also, \(j-i\) is between 1 and 9, so \(j-i \not\equiv 0 \mod 11\). Therefore, the change is nonzero, and the new sum is not divisible by 11. Hence, the error is detected.
