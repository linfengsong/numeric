To determine whether the integers 176521221 and 149235678 are divisible by 9 or 11 without performing the actual division, we can use the following rules:

### Divisibility by 9:
A number is divisible by 9 if the **sum of its digits** is divisible by 9.

### Divisibility by 11:
A number is divisible by 11 if the **alternating sum of its digits** (from left to right, subtracting and adding alternately) is divisible by 11 (including 0).

Let's apply these rules to each number.

## For 176521221:
**Digits:** 1, 7, 6, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1

### Check divisibility by 9:
Sum of digits = 1 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 27  
27 is divisible by 9 (since 27 ÷ 9 = 3).  
✅ Therefore, **176521221 is divisible by 9**.

### Check divisibility by 11:
Alternating sum:  
1 - 7 + 6 - 5 + 2 - 1 + 2 - 2 + 1 =  
(1 - 7) = -6  
(-6 + 6) = 0  
(0 - 5) = -5  
(-5 + 2) = -3  
(-3 - 1) = -4  
(-4 + 2) = -2  
(-2 - 2) = -4  
(-4 + 1) = -3  
The alternating sum is -3, which is **not divisible by 11** (since -3 ÷ 11 is not an integer).  
❌ Therefore, **176521221 is not divisible by 11**.

## For 149235678:
**Digits:** 1, 4, 9, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8

### Check divisibility by 9:
Sum of digits = 1 + 4 + 9 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 45  
45 is divisible by 9 (since 45 ÷ 9 = 5).  
✅ Therefore, **149235678 is divisible by 9**.

### Check divisibility by 11:
Alternating sum:  
1 - 4 + 9 - 2 + 3 - 5 + 6 - 7 + 8 =  
(1 - 4) = -3  
(-3 + 9) = 6  
(6 - 2) = 4  
(4 + 3) = 7  
(7 - 5) = 2  
(2 + 6) = 8  
(8 - 7) = 1  
(1 + 8) = 9  
The alternating sum is 9, which is **not divisible by 11** (since 9 ÷ 11 is not an integer).  
❌ Therefore, **149235678 is not divisible by 11**.

---

## Summary:
- **176521221** is divisible by 9, but not by 11.
- **149235678** is divisible by 9, but not by 11.

Both numbers are divisible by 9, but neither is divisible by 11.

### Lean Statement (for verification):
```lean
example : 176521221 % 9 = 0 := by native_decide
example : 176521221 % 11 ≠ 0 := by native_decide
example : 149235678 % 9 = 0 := by native_decide
example : 149235678 % 11 ≠ 0 := by native_decide
```

This Lean code confirms that:
- 176521221 is divisible by 9 (remainder 0) and not divisible by 11 (remainder nonzero).
- 149235678 is divisible by 9 (remainder 0) and not divisible by 11 (remainder nonzero).
