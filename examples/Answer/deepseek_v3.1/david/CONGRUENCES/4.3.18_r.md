I'll analyze the divisibility of 1010908899 by 7, 11, and 13 without performing actual division.

**Divisibility by 11:**
Using the alternating sum method: (1-0+1-0+9-0+8-8+9-9) = (1 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 9) - (0 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 9) = 28 - 17 = 11
Since 11 is divisible by 11, the number is divisible by 11.

**Divisibility by 7 and 13:**
I notice that 7 × 11 × 13 = 1001. This suggests using the 1001 divisibility rule.

Let me group the digits in sets of 3 from right to left:
999 (rightmost), 088, 901, 1 (leftmost)

Now calculate the alternating sum: 1 - 901 + 088 - 999 = (1 + 88) - (901 + 999) = 89 - 1900 = -1811

Since -1811 ≠ 0 and not divisible by 1001, the number is not divisible by all three simultaneously.

However, let me check divisibility by each individually:

**For 7:** The alternating sum method gives -1811. Since 1811 ÷ 7 = 258.714..., not an integer, the number is not divisible by 7.

**For 13:** 1811 ÷ 13 = 139.307..., not an integer, so the number is not divisible by 13.

**Conclusion:**
- Divisible by 11: ✓ Yes
- Divisible by 7: ✗ No  
- Divisible by 13: ✗ No

The integer 1010908899 is divisible by 11 but not by 7 or 13.
