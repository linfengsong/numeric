Let's factor the repunit \( R_6 = 111111 \).

First, note that \( R_6 = 111111 \).

We can write:
\[
111111 = 111 \times 1001
\]
But let's factor it completely.

Alternatively, we can use the formula for repunits:
\[
R_n = \frac{10^n - 1}{9}
\]
So for \( n=6 \):
\[
R_6 = \frac{10^6 - 1}{9} = \frac{1000000 - 1}{9} = \frac{999999}{9} = 111111
\]

Now, factor \( 10^6 - 1 \):
\[
10^6 - 1 = (10^3 - 1)(10^3 + 1) = (999)(1001)
\]
But we need to factor further.

Actually:
\[
10^6 - 1 = (10 - 1)(10^2 + 10 + 1)(10^2 - 10 + 1)(10^2 + 1)(10 + 1)
\]
Wait, that might be overcomplicating.

Better to factor \( 999999 \):
\[
999999 = 9 \times 111111
\]
But we want \( 111111 = \frac{999999}{9} \).

So factor \( 999999 \):
First, \( 999999 = 3^2 \times 111111 \), but we already know that.

Now, factor \( 111111 \):

Divide by 3:
\( 111111 \div 3 = 37037 \), so \( 111111 = 3 \times 37037 \).

Now factor 37037:
Divide by 7: \( 37037 \div 7 = 5291 \), so \( 37037 = 7 \times 5291 \).

Now factor 5291:
Divide by 11: \( 5291 \div 11 = 481 \), so \( 5291 = 11 \times 481 \).

Now factor 481:
Divide by 13: \( 481 \div 13 = 37 \), so \( 481 = 13 \times 37 \).

And 37 is prime.

So putting it all together:
\[
111111 = 3 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 37
\]

We can verify:
\( 3 \times 7 = 21 \)
\( 21 \times 11 = 231 \)
\( 231 \times 13 = 3003 \)
\( 3003 \times 37 = 111111 \) ✓

Therefore, the prime factorization is:
\[
R_6 = 111111 = 3 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 37
\]

In Lean, we can state this as:

```lean
example : (111111 : ℕ) = 3 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 37 := by native_decide
```

This will prove that the factorization is correct.

Output in normal language:
The repunit \( R_6 = 111111 \) factors into primes as \( 3 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 37 \).
