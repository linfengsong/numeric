Let's analyze the problem step by step:

**Given:**
- 72 canned hams were purchased for \$x67.9y.
- The total cost is given in the form: dollars = x67.9y, meaning there are digits in the hundreds (x), tens (6), ones (7), decimal point, tenths (9), and hundredths (y).
- So, the total cost is: \$ (100x + 67 + 0.9 + 0.01y) = \$ (100x + 67.9y)  [but more precisely: the number is x67.9y, which is 100x + 67 + 0.9 + 0.01y = 100x + 67.9 + y/100]

Actually, to be precise:
The amount is written as "x67.9y", which means:
- The hundreds digit is x (so value 100x)
- The tens digit is 6 (value 60)
- The ones digit is 7 (value 7)
- Then decimal point
- The tenths digit is 9 (value 0.9)
- The hundredths digit is y (value 0.01y)

So total amount = 100x + 60 + 7 + 0.9 + 0.01y = 100x + 67.9 + y/100

But since it's money, it is in dollars and cents. So the total cost in cents is: (100x + 67) dollars and (90 + y) cents? Wait, let's express it in cents to avoid decimals.

Let the total cost be C cents.
The amount is \$x67.9y, which is (100x + 67) dollars and (90 + y) cents? Actually, careful: "x67.9y" means:
- The integer part is x67, which is 100x + 67 dollars.
- The fractional part is 0.9y, which is 0.9 + y/100 = (90 + y)/100 dollars.
So total dollars = (100x + 67) + (90 + y)/100 = (10000x + 6700 + 90 + y)/100 = (10000x + 6790 + y)/100 dollars.
Therefore, total cost in cents = 100 * [total dollars] = 100 * (10000x + 6790 + y)/100 = 10000x + 6790 + y.

So C = 10000x + 6790 + y  cents.

Now, we know that 72 hams were purchased. So the cost per ham is C/72 cents, which must be an integer (since price per ham is in cents, and typically money is in whole cents). Therefore, C must be divisible by 72.

So we have:
C = 10000x + 6790 + y
and 72 divides C.

Now, x and y are digits: x from 0 to 9, y from 0 to 9.

So C = 10000x + 6790 + y

We need to find digits x and y such that C is divisible by 72.

Since 72 = 8 * 9, C must be divisible by both 8 and 9.

First, check divisibility by 8:
A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits are divisible by 8.
Here, C = 10000x + 6790 + y. The last three digits? Actually, careful: C is a number with up to 5 digits (since x is a digit, 10000x is between 0 and 90000, plus 6790 to 6799, so C is between 6790 and 96799). So we can look at the last three digits of C.

Write C = 10000x + 6790 + y.
The last three digits are determined by 790 + y? Because 10000x doesn't affect last three digits (it adds multiples of 10000). So the last three digits are: from 6790 to 6799, i.e., 790 to 799? Actually, 6790: last three are 790; 6791:791; ... 6799:799.

So we need the number formed by the last three digits (which is 790 + y) to be divisible by 8.

So let N = 790 + y.
We need N divisible by 8.

Compute for y=0 to 9:
y=0: 790 / 8 = 98.75 -> not integer.
y=1: 791 / 8 = 98.875 -> no.
y=2: 792 / 8 = 99 -> yes.
y=3: 793 / 8 = 99.125 -> no.
y=4: 794 / 8 = 99.25 -> no.
y=5: 795 / 8 = 99.375 -> no.
y=6: 796 / 8 = 99.5 -> no.
y=7: 797 / 8 = 99.625 -> no.
y=8: 798 / 8 = 99.75 -> no.
y=9: 799 / 8 = 99.875 -> no.

So only y=2 works.

So we have y = 2.

Now, C = 10000x + 6790 + 2 = 10000x + 6792.

Now, we need C divisible by 9.
A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

C = 10000x + 6792.
The digits of C: since x is a digit, C is between 6792 and 96792.
The digits: let's write C as: it has digits: (x), then 6,7,9,2.
So the digit sum S = x + 6 + 7 + 9 + 2 = x + 24.
We need S divisible by 9.

So x + 24 ≡ 0 (mod 9)
x ≡ -24 mod 9.
-24 mod 9: since 9* -3 = -27, so -24 - (-27)=3, so -24 ≡ 3 mod 9? Actually, easier: 24 mod 9 = 6 (since 2+4=6), so -24 ≡ -6 mod 9, and -6 mod 9 is equivalent to 3 (because -6 + 9=3).
So x ≡ 3 mod 9.
Since x is a digit from 0 to 9, x=3.

So x=3, y=2.

Therefore, the total cost is \$367.92.

Let's verify:
Total cost = \$367.92 = 36792 cents.
Number of hams = 72.
Cost per ham = 36792 / 72 = 511 cents = \$5.11, which is integer.

So the missing digits are x=3 and y=2.

**Final Answer:**
The missing digits are \(x = 3\) and \(y = 2\), so the total cost is \$367.92. This means 72 canned hams were purchased for \$367.92, which is \$5.11 per ham.
