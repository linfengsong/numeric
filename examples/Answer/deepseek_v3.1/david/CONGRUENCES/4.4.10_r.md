Let's denote the total number of gold coins as \( N \).

**Step 1: First division (17 pirates)**
- When divided equally among 17 pirates, there are 3 coins left over.
- So, \( N \equiv 3 \pmod{17} \).

**Step 2: Second division (16 pirates)**
- After one pirate is killed, there are 16 pirates.
- When divided equally among 16 pirates, there are 10 coins left over.
- So, \( N \equiv 10 \pmod{16} \).

**Step 3: Third division (15 pirates)**
- After another pirate is killed, there are 15 pirates.
- Now, the coins are evenly distributed (no remainder).
- So, \( N \equiv 0 \pmod{15} \).

We are to find the smallest positive integer \( N \) satisfying:
\[
\begin{cases}
N \equiv 3 \pmod{17} \\
N \equiv 10 \pmod{16} \\
N \equiv 0 \pmod{15}
\end{cases}
\]

Let \( N = 15k \) for some integer \( k \), since \( N \equiv 0 \pmod{15} \).

Substitute into the first congruence:
\[
15k \equiv 3 \pmod{17}
\]
Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 15 modulo 17. Note that \( 15 \times 8 = 120 \equiv 120 - 7 \times 17 = 120 - 119 = 1 \pmod{17} \), so the inverse of 15 is 8.
\[
k \equiv 3 \times 8 = 24 \equiv 24 - 17 = 7 \pmod{17}
\]
So, \( k \equiv 7 \pmod{17} \), i.e., \( k = 17m + 7 \) for some integer \( m \).

Now substitute into the second congruence:
\[
N = 15k = 15(17m + 7) = 255m + 105
\]
We require \( N \equiv 10 \pmod{16} \):
\[
255m + 105 \equiv 10 \pmod{16}
\]
Reduce coefficients modulo 16:
- \( 255 \div 16 = 15 \times 16 = 240 \), remainder 15, so \( 255 \equiv 15 \pmod{16} \).
- \( 105 \div 16 = 6 \times 16 = 96 \), remainder 9, so \( 105 \equiv 9 \pmod{16} \).
So:
\[
15m + 9 \equiv 10 \pmod{16}
\implies 15m \equiv 1 \pmod{16}
\]
Now, find the inverse of 15 modulo 16. Note that \( 15 \equiv -1 \pmod{16} \), so \( (-1) \times m \equiv 1 \pmod{16} \implies -m \equiv 1 \pmod{16} \implies m \equiv -1 \equiv 15 \pmod{16} \).
So, \( m = 16n + 15 \) for some integer \( n \).

Now substitute back:
\[
k = 17m + 7 = 17(16n + 15) + 7 = 272n + 255 + 7 = 272n + 262
\]
\[
N = 15k = 15(272n + 262) = 4080n + 3930
\]
The smallest positive \( N \) is when \( n = 0 \): \( N = 3930 \).

**Verification:**
- Divide by 17: \( 3930 \div 17 = 231 \) remainder \( 3 \) (since \( 17 \times 231 = 3927 \), \( 3930 - 3927 = 3 \)).
- Divide by 16: \( 3930 \div 16 = 245 \) remainder \( 10 \) (since \( 16 \times 245 = 3920 \), \( 3930 - 3920 = 10 \)).
- Divide by 15: \( 3930 \div 15 = 262 \) exactly.

Thus, the least number of coins is 3930.

**Lean Statement:**

  -- However, for brevity, we note that the solution is unique modulo LCM(15,16,17)=4080,

```

**Output in normal language:**
The least number of gold coins that could have been stolen is 3930. This satisfies:
- When divided among 17 pirates, 3 coins remain.
- After one pirate is killed (16 pirates), 10 coins remain.
- After another pirate is killed (15 pirates), the coins are evenly distributed with no remainder.
