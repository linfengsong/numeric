### Proof of Divisibility Criteria

We'll prove each criterion by expressing an integer \( n \) in base-10 representation and analyzing divisibility conditions.

---

#### (a) Divisibility by 2  
**Criterion:** An integer is divisible by 2 if and only if its units digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

**Proof:**  
Let \( n = \sum_{k=0}^{m} d_k \cdot 10^k \), where \( d_0 \) is the units digit.  
Note \( 10^k \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \) for \( k \geq 1 \), so \( n \equiv d_0 \pmod{2} \).  
Thus, \( n \) is divisible by 2 iff \( d_0 \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \), i.e., \( d_0 \) is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).  
✅ **QED**

---

#### (b) Divisibility by 3  
**Criterion:** An integer is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

**Proof:**  
Let \( n = \sum_{k=0}^{m} d_k \cdot 10^k \).  
Since \( 10 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), we have \( 10^k \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \) for all \( k \).  
Thus, \( n \equiv \sum_{k=0}^{m} d_k \pmod{3} \).  
Therefore, \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \) iff \( \sum d_k \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \).  
✅ **QED**

---

#### (c) Divisibility by 4  
**Criterion:** An integer is divisible by 4 if and only if the number formed by its tens and units digits is divisible by 4.

**Proof:**  
Let \( n = \sum_{k=0}^{m} d_k \cdot 10^k \).  
Note \( 10^k \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \) for \( k \geq 2 \), so \( n \equiv d_1 \cdot 10 + d_0 \pmod{4} \).  
Thus, \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \) iff \( 10d_1 + d_0 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), i.e., the number \( 10d_1 + d_0 \) (the last two digits) is divisible by 4.  
✅ **QED**

---

#### (d) Divisibility by 5  
**Criterion:** An integer is divisible by 5 if and only if its units digit is 0 or 5.

**Proof:**  
Let \( n = \sum_{k=0}^{m} d_k \cdot 10^k \).  
Since \( 10^k \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) for \( k \geq 1 \), we have \( n \equiv d_0 \pmod{5} \).  
Thus, \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) iff \( d_0 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), i.e., \( d_0 = 0 \) or \( 5 \).  
✅ **QED**

### Explanation in Normal Language

- **(a) For divisibility by 2:** A number is divisible by 2 exactly when its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). This is because the entire number modulo 2 depends only on the last digit.
- **(b) For divisibility by 3:** A number is divisible by 3 exactly when the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. This works because powers of 10 are congruent to 1 modulo 3, so the number is congruent to the digit sum modulo 3.
- **(c) For divisibility by 4:** A number is divisible by 4 exactly when the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. This is because 100 and higher powers are divisible by 4, so only the last two digits matter.
- **(d) For divisibility by 5:** A number is divisible by 5 exactly when its last digit is 0 or 5. This is because powers of 10 beyond the units place are divisible by 5, so the divisibility depends solely on the units digit.

These criteria are efficient for mental math and quick checks without performing full division.
