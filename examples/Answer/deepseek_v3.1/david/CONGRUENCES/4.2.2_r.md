Of course. Here is a complete explanation, written first as a Lean 4 statement and then in normal mathematical language.

### 1. Lean 4 Statement

```lean
-- We'll work with the integers `ℤ` and the modulus 8.
example : ¬ (∀ (a b : ℤ) (n : ℕ), a^2 ≡ b^2 [ZMOD n] → a ≡ b [ZMOD n]) := by
  -- Provide a counterexample to disprove the universal statement.
  intro h  -- Assume the statement is true for all a, b, n.
  -- Let a = 1, b = 3, and n = 8.
  have := h (1 : ℤ) (3 : ℤ) (8)
  -- We know that 1^2 = 1 and 3^2 = 9. 9 - 1 = 8, which is divisible by 8.
  -- So, 1^2 ≡ 3^2 mod 8 is true.
  have h_squares_eq : (1 : ℤ)^2 ≡ (3 : ℤ)^2 [ZMOD (8 : ℕ)] := by
    unfold Int.ModEq
    show (8 : ℤ) ∣ (1 : ℤ)^2 - (3 : ℤ)^2
    simp  -- This simplifies the goal to `8 ∣ -8`, which is true.
  -- By our initial assumption `h`, this would force 1 ≡ 3 mod 8.
  have h1 := this h_squares_eq
  -- However, 3 - 1 = 2, which is not divisible by 8.
  -- We can show this contradiction by normalizing the equivalence.
  have h2 : ¬((1 : ℤ) ≡ (3 : ℤ) [ZMOD (8 : ℕ)]) := by
    unfold Int.ModEq
    norm_num  -- This simplifies the goal to `¬(8 ∣ 2)`, which is true.
  -- We now have a contradiction (h1 and h2).
  exact h2 h1
```

### 2. Output in Normal Language

The statement "$a^2 \equiv b^2 \pmod{n}$ implies $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$" is **not** true in general.

**Counterexample:**
Let $a = 1$, $b = 3$, and $n = 8$.

1.  Check the squares:
    *   $a^2 = 1^2 = 1$
    *   $b^2 = 3^2 = 9$

2.  Check the first condition ($a^2 \equiv b^2 \pmod{n}$):
    $9 - 1 = 8$, and $8$ is divisible by $8$.
    Therefore, $1 \equiv 9 \pmod{8}$ is **true**.

3.  Check the second condition ($a \equiv b \pmod{n}$):
    $3 - 1 = 2$, and $2$ is **not** divisible by $8$.
    Therefore, $1 \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$ is **false**.

**Conclusion:**
We have a case where $a^2 \equiv b^2 \pmod{n}$ is true, but $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ is false. This proves that the implication does not hold universally.
