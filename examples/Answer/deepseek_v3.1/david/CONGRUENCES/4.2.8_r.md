### Proof of Assertions

#### (a) If \( a \) is an odd integer, then \( a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \).

**Proof:**
Since \( a \) is odd, we can write \( a = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). Then:
\[
a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k + 1) + 1.
\]
Note that \( k(k + 1) \) is always even (since one of \( k \) or \( k + 1 \) is even), so \( 4k(k + 1) \) is divisible by 8. Therefore:
\[
a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{8}.
\]

#### (b) For any integer \( a \), \( a^3 \equiv 0, 1, \text{or } 6 \pmod{7} \).

**Proof:**
We consider the residues modulo 7. The possible residues are \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \). Compute each cube modulo 7:
- \( 0^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
- \( 1^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
- \( 3^3 = 27 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \) (since \( 27 - 21 = 6 \))
- \( 4^3 = 64 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \) (since \( 64 - 63 = 1 \))
- \( 5^3 = 125 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \) (since \( 125 - 119 = 6 \))
- \( 6^3 = 216 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \) (since \( 216 - 210 = 6 \))

The cubes modulo 7 yield only \( 0, 1, 6 \). Hence, for any integer \( a \), \( a^3 \equiv 0, 1, \text{or } 6 \pmod{7} \).

---

#### (c) For any integer \( a \), \( a^4 \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \pmod{5} \).

**Proof:**
Consider residues modulo 5: \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \). Compute each fourth power modulo 5:
- \( 0^4 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \)
- \( 1^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
- \( 2^4 = 16 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
- \( 3^4 = 81 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \) (since \( 81 - 80 = 1 \))
- \( 4^4 = 256 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \) (since \( 255 \) is divisible by 5, \( 256 \equiv 1 \))

Thus, \( a^4 \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \pmod{5} \).

---

#### (d) If the integer \( a \) is not divisible by 2 or 3, then \( a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{24} \).

**Proof:**
Since \( a \) is not divisible by 2 or 3, \( a \) is coprime to 24. Note that \( 24 = 8 \cdot 3 \), and we will show \( a^2 \equiv 1 \) modulo 8 and modulo 3, then apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

1. **Modulo 8:** Since \( a \) is odd, by part (a), \( a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \).
2. **Modulo 3:** The possible residues coprime to 3 are \( 1 \) and \( 2 \):
   - \( 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
   - \( 2^2 = 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
   So \( a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).

Since \( a^2 \equiv 1 \) modulo 8 and modulo 3, and \( \gcd(8,3)=1 \), by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, \( a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{24} \).

### Output in Normal Language:

- **(a)** For any odd integer \( a \), \( a^2 \) is always congruent to 1 modulo 8. This is because squaring an odd number \( 2k+1 \) gives \( 4k(k+1) + 1 \), and \( k(k+1) \) is even, making \( 4k(k+1) \) divisible by 8.
- **(b)** For any integer \( a \), the cube \( a^3 \) modulo 7 is always 0, 1, or 6. This is verified by checking all residues modulo 7.
- **(c)** For any integer \( a \), the fourth power \( a^4 \) modulo 5 is always 0 or 1. This is confirmed by checking all residues modulo 5.
- **(d)** If an integer \( a \) is not divisible by 2 or 3, then \( a^2 \) is congruent to 1 modulo 24. This follows because \( a^2 \equiv 1 \) modulo 8 (since \( a \) is odd) and modulo 3 (since \( a \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3} \)), and 24 is the least common multiple of 8 and 3.

The Lean proofs formalize these arguments using residue checks and properties of divisibility.
