I'll verify these divisibility statements using the theory of congruences.

**First statement: 89 divides 2⁴⁴ - 1**

We want to show that 2⁴⁴ ≡ 1 (mod 89)

Since 89 is prime, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem: 2⁸⁸ ≡ 1 (mod 89)

Thus, 2⁴⁴ = √(2⁸⁸) ≡ √1 ≡ ±1 (mod 89)

We need to determine which sign is correct. Let's find the order of 2 modulo 89:

2¹¹ = 2048 ≡ 2048 - 22×89 = 2048 - 1958 = 90 ≡ 1 (mod 89) ✗
2²² = (2¹¹)² ≡ 1² = 1 (mod 89) ✗
2⁴⁴ = (2²²)² ≡ 1² = 1 (mod 89) ✓

Therefore, 2⁴⁴ ≡ 1 (mod 89), so 89 divides 2⁴⁴ - 1.

**Second statement: 97 divides 2⁴⁸ - 1**

We want to show that 2⁴⁸ ≡ 1 (mod 97)

Since 97 is prime, Fermat's Little Theorem gives: 2⁹⁶ ≡ 1 (mod 97)

Thus, 2⁴⁸ = √(2⁹⁶) ≡ √1 ≡ ±1 (mod 97)

Let's find the order of 2 modulo 97:

2⁴⁸ ≡ ? (mod 97)
2²⁴ = 16777216 ≡ 16777216 - 172961×97 = 16777216 - 16777217 = -1 (mod 97)
2⁴⁸ = (2²⁴)² ≡ (-1)² = 1 (mod 97) ✓

Therefore, 2⁴⁸ ≡ 1 (mod 97), so 97 divides 2⁴⁸ - 1.

**Both statements are verified:**
- 89 divides 2⁴⁴ - 1
- 97 divides 2⁴⁸ - 1
