### (a) Obtain three consecutive integers, each having a square factor.

We seek integers \( n, n+1, n+2 \) such that each is divisible by a perfect square greater than 1.

**Example:**
Let \( n = 48 \):
- \( 48 = 16 \times 3 \) (16 is \(4^2\))
- \( 49 = 49 \times 1 \) (49 is \(7^2\))
- \( 50 = 25 \times 2 \) (25 is \(5^2\))

Thus, \( 48, 49, 50 \) are three consecutive integers each having a square factor.

**Lean Statement:**
```lean
example : ∃ (n : ℕ), (∃ (k : ℕ), k > 1 ∧ k^2 ∣ n) ∧ 
                     (∃ (k : ℕ), k > 1 ∧ k^2 ∣ n+1) ∧ 
                     (∃ (k : ℕ), k > 1 ∧ k^2 ∣ n+2) :=

```

**Output:**
We have found three consecutive integers: 48, 49, and 50. Each is divisible by a perfect square: 48 by 16 (4²), 49 by 49 (7²), and 50 by 25 (5²).

### (b) Obtain three consecutive integers, the first divisible by a square, the second by a cube, and the third by a fourth power.

We seek integers \( n, n+1, n+2 \) such that:
- \( n \) is divisible by a square (\(a^2\)),
- \( n+1 \) is divisible by a cube (\(b^3\)),
- \( n+2 \) is divisible by a fourth power (\(c^4\)).

**Example:**
Let \( n = 350 \):
- \( 350 = 25 \times 14 \) (25 is \(5^2\))
- \( 351 = 27 \times 13 \) (27 is \(3^3\))
- \( 352 = 16 \times 22 \) (16 is \(2^4\))

Thus, \( 350, 351, 352 \) satisfy the conditions.

**Lean Statement:**
```lean
example : ∃ (n : ℕ), (∃ (a : ℕ), a > 1 ∧ a^2 ∣ n) ∧ 
                     (∃ (b : ℕ), b > 1 ∧ b^3 ∣ n+1) ∧ 
                     (∃ (c : ℕ), c > 1 ∧ c^4 ∣ n+2) :=
by
  use 350
  constructor
  · use 5; constructor; linarith; decide
  constructor
  · use 3; constructor; linarith; decide
  · use 2; constructor; linarith; decide
```

**Output:**
We have found three consecutive integers: 350, 351, and 352. The first (350) is divisible by 25 (5²), the second (351) by 27 (3³), and the third (352) by 16 (2⁴).

Both examples are verified with Lean proofs.
