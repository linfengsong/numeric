I need to solve this basket-of-eggs problem. Let me restate it clearly:

- When removing eggs 2 at a time, 1 remains
- When removing eggs 3 at a time, 1 remains  
- When removing eggs 4 at a time, 1 remains
- When removing eggs 5 at a time, 1 remains
- When removing eggs 6 at a time, 1 remains
- When removing eggs 7 at a time, 0 remain

So I'm looking for the smallest number N such that:
- N ≡ 1 mod 2
- N ≡ 1 mod 3
- N ≡ 1 mod 4
- N ≡ 1 mod 5
- N ≡ 1 mod 6
- N ≡ 0 mod 7

This means N - 1 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So N - 1 must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.

Let me find LCM(2,3,4,5,6):
- Prime factors: 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 2², 5 = 5, 6 = 2×3
- LCM = 2² × 3 × 5 = 4 × 3 × 5 = 60

So N - 1 = 60k for some integer k, meaning N = 60k + 1

Now I also need N ≡ 0 mod 7, so:
60k + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me simplify 60 mod 7:
60 ÷ 7 = 8 remainder 4, so 60 ≡ 4 mod 7

So the equation becomes:
4k + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7
4k ≡ -1 mod 7
4k ≡ 6 mod 7 (since -1 ≡ 6 mod 7)

Now I need to solve 4k ≡ 6 mod 7. Let me find the inverse of 4 mod 7.

4 × 2 = 8 ≡ 1 mod 7, so the inverse of 4 is 2 mod 7.

Multiply both sides by 2:
k ≡ 6 × 2 mod 7
k ≡ 12 mod 7
k ≡ 5 mod 7

So k = 7m + 5 for some integer m

The smallest positive k is when m = 0, so k = 5

Then N = 60 × 5 + 1 = 300 + 1 = 301

Let me verify:
- 301 ÷ 2 = 150 remainder 1 ✓
- 301 ÷ 3 = 100 remainder 1 ✓  
- 301 ÷ 4 = 75 remainder 1 ✓
- 301 ÷ 5 = 60 remainder 1 ✓
- 301 ÷ 6 = 50 remainder 1 ✓
- 301 ÷ 7 = 43 remainder 0 ✓

Perfect! All conditions are satisfied.

The smallest number of eggs that could have been in the basket is 301. This number satisfies all the given conditions: it leaves 1 egg remaining when eggs are removed 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 at a time, and leaves no eggs remaining when removed 7 at a time.
