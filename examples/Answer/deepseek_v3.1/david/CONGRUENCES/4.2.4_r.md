Let's solve each part step by step.

### (a) Remainders when \(2^{50}\) and \(41^{65}\) are divided by 7

#### For \(2^{50} \mod 7\):
First, compute the pattern of powers of 2 modulo 7:
- \(2^1 \equiv 2 \mod 7\)
- \(2^2 \equiv 4 \mod 7\)
- \(2^3 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \mod 7\)
- \(2^4 \equiv 2 \mod 7\)
- \(2^5 \equiv 4 \mod 7\)
- \(2^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\)

The pattern repeats every 3 exponents: \(2, 4, 1\).

Now, \(50 \div 3 = 16\) with remainder 2 (since \(3 \times 16 = 48\), and \(50 - 48 = 2\)).
So, \(2^{50} \equiv 2^2 \equiv 4 \mod 7\).

**Therefore, the remainder for \(2^{50}\) is 4.**

#### For \(41^{65} \mod 7\):
First, simplify the base modulo 7:
\(41 \div 7 = 5 \times 7 = 35\), remainder \(41 - 35 = 6\), so \(41 \equiv 6 \equiv -1 \mod 7\).

So, \(41^{65} \equiv (-1)^{65} \mod 7\).

Since 65 is odd, \((-1)^{65} = -1 \equiv 6 \mod 7\).

**Therefore, the remainder for \(41^{65}\) is 6.**

### (b) Remainder when \(1^5 + 2^5 + 3^5 + \cdots + 100^5\) is divided by 4

We need to compute:
\[
S = \sum_{n=1}^{100} n^5 \mod 4
\]

First, note that modulo 4, the behavior of \(n^5\) depends on \(n \mod 4\):

Let’s compute \(n^5 \mod 4\) for each residue class:

- If \(n \equiv 0 \mod 4\), then \(n^5 \equiv 0^5 = 0 \mod 4\).
- If \(n \equiv 1 \mod 4\), then \(n^5 \equiv 1^5 = 1 \mod 4\).
- If \(n \equiv 2 \mod 4\), then \(n^5 \equiv 2^5 = 32 \equiv 0 \mod 4\) (since 32 ÷ 4 = 8 exactly).
- If \(n \equiv 3 \mod 4\), then \(n^5 \equiv 3^5 = 243\). Now, \(243 \div 4 = 60 \times 4 = 240\), remainder \(3\), so \(243 \equiv 3 \mod 4\).

So, summarizing:
- \(n \equiv 0 \mod 4 \Rightarrow n^5 \equiv 0 \mod 4\)
- \(n \equiv 1 \mod 4 \Rightarrow n^5 \equiv 1 \mod 4\)
- \(n \equiv 2 \mod 4 \Rightarrow n^5 \equiv 0 \mod 4\)
- \(n \equiv 3 \mod 4 \Rightarrow n^5 \equiv 3 \mod 4\)

Now, from 1 to 100, there are exactly 25 numbers in each residue class (since 100/4=25).

So, the sum modulo 4:
- For \(n \equiv 0 \mod 4\): each contributes 0, total 0.
- For \(n \equiv 1 \mod 4\): each contributes 1, total \(25 \times 1 = 25 \equiv 1 \mod 4\) (since 25 ÷ 4 = 6*4=24, remainder 1).
- For \(n \equiv 2 \mod 4\): each contributes 0, total 0.
- For \(n \equiv 3 \mod 4\): each contributes 3, total \(25 \times 3 = 75 \equiv 3 \mod 4\) (since 75 ÷ 4 = 18*4=72, remainder 3).

So, total sum \(S \mod 4 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 4 \equiv 0 \mod 4\).

**Therefore, the remainder when the sum is divided by 4 is 0.**

---

### Final Answers:
(a) The remainder when \(2^{50}\) is divided by 7 is **4**, and the remainder when \(41^{65}\) is divided by 7 is **6**.

(b) The remainder when \(1^5 + 2^5 + \cdots + 100^5\) is divided by 4 is **0**.

### Lean Statement (for verification):
```lean
-- For part (a)
example : 2^50 % 7 = 4 := by native_decide
example : 41^65 % 7 = 6 := by native_decide

-- For part (b): We compute the sum modulo 4
example : (∑ n in Finset.range 100, (n+1)^5) % 4 = 0 := by native_decide
```

Note: The `Finset.range 100` gives numbers from 0 to 99, so we use `n+1` to get 1 to 100. The `native_decide` tactic can handle these computations.
