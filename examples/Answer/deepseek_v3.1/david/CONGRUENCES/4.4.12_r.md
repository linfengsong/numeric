I need to use Problem 11 (which states that a system x ≡ a (mod m) and x ≡ b (mod n) has a solution if and only if a ≡ b (mod gcd(m,n))) to show that this system has no solution:

x ≡ 5 (mod 6) and x ≡ 7 (mod 15)

Let me apply Problem 11:

m = 6, n = 15
gcd(m,n) = gcd(6,15) = 3
a = 5, b = 7

According to Problem 11, the system has a solution if and only if:
a ≡ b (mod gcd(m,n))
5 ≡ 7 (mod 3)

Now let's check this congruence:
5 mod 3 = 2
7 mod 3 = 1

Since 2 ≠ 1, we have:
5 ≢ 7 (mod 3)

Therefore, by Problem 11, the system x ≡ 5 (mod 6) and x ≡ 7 (mod 15) does not possess a solution.

**Final Answer:** The system x ≡ 5 (mod 6) and x ≡ 7 (mod 15) does not possess a solution because 5 ≢ 7 (mod 3), where 3 = gcd(6,15).
