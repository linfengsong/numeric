Of course. Here is the proof, first written as a Lean 4 statement and then explained in normal mathematical language.

### 1. Lean 4 Statement

```lean
theorem gcd_eq_of_congr (a b n : ℤ) (h : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]) : Int.gcd a n = Int.gcd b n := by
  -- Since a ≡ b [ZMOD n], n ∣ (a - b)
  have hdiv : (n : ℤ) ∣ a - b := h
  -- Let d = gcd(a, n). By definition, d ∣ a and d ∣ n.
  -- Since d ∣ n and n ∣ (a - b), we have d ∣ (a - b) (by the transitivity of ∣).
  -- Since d ∣ a and d ∣ (a - b), we have d ∣ (a - (a - b)) = d ∣ b.
  -- So d is a common divisor of b and n. Therefore, d ∣ gcd(b, n).
  -- A symmetric argument (starting with the gcd(b, n)) shows gcd(b, n) ∣ gcd(a, n).
  -- Since they divide each other, they must be equal (up to sign, but gcd is nonnegative).
  rcases hdiv with ⟨k, hk⟩
  have h1 : a = b + n * k := by linarith [hk]
  rw [h1]
  simp [Int.gcd_add_mul_right_right b n k]
```

**Note:** The `simp` tactic with the lemma `Int.gcd_add_mul_right_right` elegantly handles the algebraic manipulation required for the proof. This lemma states that `gcd (b + n * k) n = gcd b n`, which is precisely what we need after the substitution `a = b + n * k`.

### 2. Proof in Normal Mathematical Language

**Statement:** If $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$, then $\gcd(a, n) = \gcd(b, n)$.

**Proof:**

Assume $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$. By the definition of congruence modulo $n$, this means $n \mid (a - b)$. Therefore, there exists an integer $k$ such that:
$$a - b = n \cdot k$$
which can be rearranged as:
$$a = b + n \cdot k \quad \text{(Equation 1)}$$

Let $d = \gcd(a, n)$. We will now show that $d$ is also a common divisor of $b$ and $n$.
1.  By definition, $d \mid a$ and $d \mid n$.
2.  Since $d \mid n$ and $n \mid (a - b)$, the transitivity of divisibility tells us that $d \mid (a - b)$.
3.  Now, $d$ divides both $a$ and $(a - b)$. A fundamental property of divisibility is that if a number divides two others, it also divides any linear combination of them. Specifically, $d$ must divide:
    $$a - (a - b) = b$$
    Therefore, $d \mid b$.

Since $d \mid b$ and $d \mid n$, the number $d$ is a common divisor of $b$ and $n$. By the definition of the greatest common divisor, any common divisor of $b$ and $n$ must divide $\gcd(b, n)$. Thus, we have:
$$d \mid \gcd(b, n) \quad \text{(Conclusion A)}$$

Now, let's consider $e = \gcd(b, n)$. We can perform a symmetric argument to show that $e$ divides $\gcd(a, n)$.
From Equation 1 ($a = b + n \cdot k$), we see that $a$ is a linear combination of $b$ and $n$. Since $e \mid b$ and $e \mid n$, it must also divide any linear combination of $b$ and $n$, so $e \mid a$. Therefore, $e$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $n$, which means it must divide their greatest common divisor:
$$e \mid \gcd(a, n) \quad \text{(Conclusion B)}$$

From Conclusions A and B, we have:
$$\gcd(a, n) \mid \gcd(b, n) \quad \text{and} \quad \gcd(b, n) \mid \gcd(a, n)$$

In the integers, if two nonnegative numbers divide each other, they must be equal. Therefore:
$$\gcd(a, n) = \gcd(b, n)$$

This completes the proof.
