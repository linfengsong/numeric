### Proofs

#### (a) If gcd(a, n) = 1, then the integers  
$$c, c + a, c + 2a, c + 3a, \dots, c + (n - 1)a$$  
form a complete set of residues modulo n for any c.

**Proof:**  
Since gcd(a, n) = 1, a is invertible modulo n. Consider the differences between any two distinct terms in the sequence:  
$$(c + ka) - (c + la) = (k - l)a \quad \text{for } 0 \leq k, l \leq n-1, k \neq l.$$  
If \(k \neq l\), then \(k - l\) is not divisible by n (since \(|k-l| < n\)), and because gcd(a, n)=1, \((k-l)a\) is not divisible by n. Hence,  
$$c + ka \not\equiv c + la \pmod{n}.$$  
Thus, all n terms are distinct modulo n. Since there are n terms and n residue classes modulo n, they form a complete set of residues modulo n.  
∎

#### (b) Any n consecutive integers form a complete set of residues modulo n.

**Proof:**  
Let the consecutive integers be \(m, m+1, m+2, \dots, m+n-1\). Their residues modulo n are:  
$$m \bmod n, (m+1) \bmod n, \dots, (m+n-1) \bmod n.$$  
These are n consecutive integers modulo n. Since the integers modulo n are cyclic with period n, any block of n consecutive integers must cover all residues from 0 to n-1 exactly once. Therefore, they form a complete set of residues modulo n.  
∎

#### (c) The product of any set of n consecutive integers is divisible by n.

**Proof:**  
By part (b), any n consecutive integers form a complete set of residues modulo n. Therefore, their product includes one integer from each residue class. In particular, there is an integer divisible by n (unless n=0, but n≥1). However, if n>1, we can also use the fact that the product must be divisible by all primes up to n (by properties of binomial coefficients), but a simpler argument is:  
Since the set contains a multiple of n (as it covers all residues, including 0), the product is divisible by n.  
More formally: let the integers be \(k, k+1, \dots, k+n-1\). Since they form a complete residue system modulo n, there exists some \(j\) with \(0 \leq j \leq n-1\) such that \(k + j \equiv 0 \pmod{n}\), i.e., \(n \mid (k+j)\). Hence, \(n\) divides the product.  
∎

### Output in Normal Language

- **(a)** Given gcd(a, n)=1, the arithmetic progression \(c, c+a, c+2a, \dots, c+(n-1)a\) covers all residues modulo n exactly once for any integer c. This is because the differences between terms are multiples of a, and since a is coprime to n, no two terms are congruent modulo n.

- **(b)** Any sequence of n consecutive integers, such as \(m, m+1, \dots, m+n-1\), will include exactly one integer from each residue class modulo n. This is because the residues cycle every n steps, so a block of n consecutive integers must include all residues from 0 to n-1.

- **(c)** The product of n consecutive integers is always divisible by n. This follows from (b): since the set includes a multiple of n (as it contains all residues, including 0), the product is divisible by n.
