Let's analyze the problem step by step:

We are given that 792 divides the integer "13xy45z". This means that "13xy45z" is divisible by 792.

First, note that 792 factors as:
792 = 8 × 9 × 11

So, for the number to be divisible by 792, it must be divisible by 8, 9, and 11.

Let the number be N = 13xy45z. This is a 7-digit number where x, y, z are digits (0-9).

We'll use the divisibility rules:

1. **Divisibility by 8**: The last three digits must be divisible by 8.
   So, 45z must be divisible by 8.

2. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of all digits must be divisible by 9.
   Digits: 1, 3, x, y, 4, 5, z.
   So, sum = 1 + 3 + x + y + 4 + 5 + z = (13 + x + y + z)  [since 1+3+4+5=13]
   So, 13 + x + y + z must be divisible by 9.

3. **Divisibility by 11**: The alternating sum of digits must be divisible by 11.
   For digits d7 d6 d5 d4 d3 d2 d1 (from left to right, so d7=1, d6=3, d5=x, d4=y, d3=4, d2=5, d1=z)
   Alternating sum: (d7 + d5 + d3 + d1) - (d6 + d4 + d2) = (1 + x + 4 + z) - (3 + y + 5) = (5 + x + z) - (8 + y) = (x + z - y - 3)
   So, (x + z - y - 3) must be divisible by 11 (i.e., 0, ±11, ±22, ... but since x,y,z are digits, it can only be 0 or ±11).

Now, let's solve step by step.

**Step 1: Divisibility by 8 (45z divisible by 8)**
We need to find z such that 450 + z is divisible by 8.
450 mod 8: 450 ÷ 8 = 56*8=448, remainder 2. So 450 ≡ 2 mod 8.
We need 2 + z ≡ 0 mod 8, so z ≡ 6 mod 8.
Thus z can be 6 or 14 (but only digit), so z = 6.

So, z = 6.

**Step 2: Divisibility by 9 (sum divisible by 9)**
Sum = 13 + x + y + z = 13 + x + y + 6 = 19 + x + y.
We need 19 + x + y ≡ 0 mod 9.
So, 19 mod 9 is 1 (since 18 is divisible, remainder 1).
So, 1 + x + y ≡ 0 mod 9, thus x + y ≡ 8 mod 9.
So, x + y can be 8 or 17 (since max 9+9=18, so 17 is possible).

**Step 3: Divisibility by 11 (alternating sum divisible by 11)**
Alternating sum = x + z - y - 3 = x + 6 - y - 3 = x - y + 3.
We need this to be divisible by 11. Since x and y are digits (0-9), the value of (x - y + 3) ranges from (0 - 9 + 3) = -6 to (9 - 0 + 3)=12.
So possible values divisible by 11 are 0 or 11 (since -11 is too low).
Case 1: x - y + 3 = 0  => x - y = -3  => y = x + 3
Case 2: x - y + 3 = 11 => x - y = 8   => y = x - 8

Now we combine with the condition from divisibility by 9: x + y ≡ 8 mod 9.

**Case 1: y = x + 3**
Then x + y = x + (x+3) = 2x + 3.
We need 2x + 3 ≡ 8 mod 9 => 2x ≡ 5 mod 9.
Multiply both sides by inverse of 2 mod 9. Since 2*5=10≡1 mod9, inverse is 5.
So x ≡ 5*5 = 25 ≡ 7 mod9.
So x can be 7 or 16 (but digit), so x=7.
Then y = 7+3=10, but y must be a digit (0-9), so y=10 is invalid. Thus no solution in this case.

**Case 2: y = x - 8**
Then x + y = x + (x-8) = 2x - 8.
We need 2x - 8 ≡ 8 mod9 => 2x ≡ 16 mod9 => 16 mod9 is 7, so 2x ≡ 7 mod9.
Multiply by inverse of 2 (which is 5): x ≡ 5*7=35 ≡ 35 mod9: 35-3*9=35-27=8, so x ≡ 8 mod9.
So x can be 8 or 17 (but digit), so x=8.
Then y = 8 - 8 = 0.
Also, x+y=8+0=8, which is ≡8 mod9, good.

So we have x=8, y=0, z=6.

Let's verify:
Number: 13xy45z = 1380456

Check divisibility:
- By 8: last three digits 456. 456 ÷ 8 = 57, exactly.
- By 9: sum of digits: 1+3+8+0+4+5+6=27, divisible by 9.
- By 11: alternating sum: (1+8+4+6) - (3+0+5) = (19) - (8)=11, divisible by 11.
So, divisible by 792.

Thus, the digits are x=8, y=0, z=6.

**Final Answer:**
x = 8, y = 0, z = 6.
