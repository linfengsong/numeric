Let \( n \) be the number of eggs in the basket. We are given the following congruences:
- \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \)
- \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
- \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \)
- \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
- \( n \equiv 5 \pmod{6} \)
- \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

Notice that the remainders are always one less than the divisor. So we can rewrite:
- \( n \equiv -1 \pmod{2} \)
- \( n \equiv -1 \pmod{3} \)
- \( n \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \)
- \( n \equiv -1 \pmod{5} \)
- \( n \equiv -1 \pmod{6} \)
- \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

This implies that \( n + 1 \) is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is:
LCM(2,3,4,5,6) = LCM(4,3,5) = 60 (since 4=2^2, 3=3, 5=5, and 6=2*3 is covered).
So \( n + 1 \) is a multiple of 60, i.e., \( n = 60k - 1 \) for some integer \( k \).

We also have \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \), so:
\( 60k - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
\( 60k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
Reduce 60 mod 7: \( 60 \div 7 = 8 \times 7 = 56 \), remainder 4, so \( 60 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \).
So \( 4k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \).

Now solve for \( k \):
\( 4k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 4 mod 7. The inverse of 4 mod 7 is 2, because \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \).
So \( k \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), i.e., \( k = 7m + 2 \) for some integer \( m \).

Then \( n = 60k - 1 = 60(7m + 2) - 1 = 420m + 120 - 1 = 420m + 119 \).

The smallest positive \( n \) is when \( m = 0 \): \( n = 119 \).

Check:
119 divided by 2: remainder 1.
119 divided by 3: 119 ÷ 3 = 39*3=117, remainder 2.
119 divided by 4: 119 ÷ 4 = 29*4=116, remainder 3.
119 divided by 5: 119 ÷ 5 = 23*5=115, remainder 4.
119 divided by 6: 119 ÷ 6 = 19*6=114, remainder 5.
119 divided by 7: exactly 17, remainder 0.

So 119 satisfies all conditions.

Therefore, the smallest number of eggs is 119.

Output in normal language:
The smallest number of eggs that satisfies the given conditions is 119. This number leaves remainders of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 respectively, and is exactly divisible by 7. No smaller positive integer meets all these criteria.
