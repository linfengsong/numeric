I'll prove this statement using Lean and then explain it in natural language.

### Lean Proof

```lean
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.PrimeCount
import Mathlib.Data.Nat.Digits

theorem prime_with_n_zeros (n : ℕ) : ∃ (p : ℕ), Nat.Prime p ∧ 
    ((Nat.digits 10 p).filter (· = 0)).length ≥ n := by
  -- Use Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions
  -- Consider numbers of the form 10^(n+1) * k + 10^n
  -- These numbers have at least n zeros in their decimal representation
  -- And there are infinitely many primes in this arithmetic progression
  sorry  -- The complete proof would use advanced number theory results
```

### Natural Language Explanation

The statement claims that for any natural number n ≥ 1, there exists a prime number that contains at least n zeros in its decimal representation.

**Proof Strategy:**
1. Consider numbers of the form: 10^(n+1)·k + 10^n
2. In decimal representation, these numbers look like: (some digits) followed by a 1, followed by n zeros
3. By Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions, since 10^(n+1) and 10^n + 1 are coprime, there are infinitely many primes in this arithmetic progression
4. Therefore, for any n, we can find a prime number with at least n zeros in its digits

**Example:** For n = 3, numbers of the form 10000·k + 1000 = 1000(10k + 1) will have at least 3 zeros in their decimal representation (like 1000, 11000, 21000, etc.), and infinitely many of these are prime.

The complete Lean proof would require invoking Dirichlet's theorem, which is available in Mathlib's number theory library, to show that the arithmetic progression 10^(n+1)·ℤ + 10^n contains infinitely many primes.
