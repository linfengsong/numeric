### ‚úÖ Part (a): Verification that \( N - M \) is divisible by 9

Let \( N \) be an integer and \( M \) be the integer formed by reversing its digits. We aim to show that \( N - M \) is divisible by 9.

**Key Observation:**  
A number modulo 9 is congruent to the sum of its digits modulo 9. This is because \( 10 \equiv 1 \pmod{9} \), so \( 10^k \equiv 1 \pmod{9} \) for any integer \( k \geq 0 \).

Let \( N \) have digits \( d_k, d_{k-1}, \dots, d_0 \), so:
\[
N = d_k \cdot 10^k + d_{k-1} \cdot 10^{k-1} + \cdots + d_0.
\]
Then modulo 9:
\[
N \equiv d_k + d_{k-1} + \cdots + d_0 \pmod{9}.
\]

The reversed number \( M \) has digits \( d_0, d_1, \dots, d_k \):
\[
M = d_0 \cdot 10^k + d_1 \cdot 10^{k-1} + \cdots + d_k.
\]
Modulo 9:
\[
M \equiv d_0 + d_1 + \cdots + d_k \pmod{9}.
\]

Since addition is commutative, the sum of digits is the same for \( N \) and \( M \):
\[
N \equiv S \pmod{9}, \quad M \equiv S \pmod{9}, \quad \text{where } S = d_0 + d_1 + \cdots + d_k.
\]
Therefore:
\[
N - M \equiv S - S = 0 \pmod{9},
\]
which means \( 9 \mid (N - M) \).

**Example:**  
Let \( N = 6923 \), so \( M = 3296 \).  
\( N - M = 6923 - 3296 = 3627 \).  
Check: \( 3627 \div 9 = 403 \), exactly. ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Part (b): Proof that any palindrome with an even number of digits is divisible by 11

A palindrome with an even number of digits has the form:
\[
N = d_1 d_2 \dots d_k d_k \dots d_2 d_1,
\]
with \( 2k \) digits.

We use the divisibility rule for 11: A number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11.

Let the digits be \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k, a_k, \dots, a_2, a_1 \).

The alternating sum is:
\[
S = (a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - \cdots + a_k) - (a_k - a_{k-1} + \cdots - a_2 + a_1).
\]
Simplify:
\[
S = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - \cdots + a_k - a_k + a_{k-1} - \cdots + a_2 - a_1.
\]
Notice that terms cancel pairwise:
- \( a_1 \) and \( -a_1 \) cancel.
- \( -a_2 \) and \( +a_2 \) cancel.
- \( a_3 \) and \( -a_3 \) cancel (after the middle).
- Similarly, all terms cancel.

Thus, \( S = 0 \), which is divisible by 11. Therefore, \( N \) is divisible by 11.

**Example:**  
Consider the palindrome \( 521125 \) (6 digits, even).  
Alternating sum: \( 5 - 2 + 1 - 1 + 2 - 5 = (5 - 5) + (-2 + 2) + (1 - 1) = 0 \).  
So, \( 521125 \div 11 = 47375 \). ‚úÖ

```lean
theorem part_a (N : ‚Ñï) : let M := Nat.ofDigits 10 (Nat.digits 10 N).reverse in

theorem part_b (n : ‚Ñï) (h : Even (Nat.digits 10 n).length) : 11 ‚à£ n := by

**Note:** The Lean code outlines the structure. The actual proofs would require more details, such as defining the reversal and using properties of digit sums modulo 9 and 11.

### üßæ Output in Normal Language

**(a)** For any integer \( N \), if \( M \) is formed by reversing its digits, then \( N - M \) is divisible by 9. This is because both \( N \) and \( M \) have the same digit sum, and hence are congruent modulo 9.

**(b)** Any palindrome with an even number of digits is divisible by 11. This follows from the divisibility rule for 11: the alternating sum of its digits is zero, which is divisible by 11.

Both results are verified.
