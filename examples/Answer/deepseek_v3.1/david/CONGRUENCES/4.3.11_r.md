Let's analyze the problem step by step:

We are given that 495 divides the number 273x49y5. This means that 273x49y5 is divisible by 495.

First, note that 495 factors as 495 = 5 * 9 * 11. Therefore, for the number to be divisible by 495, it must be divisible by 5, by 9, and by 11.

Let the number be N = 273x49y5.

1. **Divisibility by 5:**
   A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.
   Here, the last digit is 5, so it is divisible by 5. This gives no condition on x or y.

2. **Divisibility by 9:**
   A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
   The digits of N are: 2, 7, 3, x, 4, 9, y, 5.
   So the sum S = 2 + 7 + 3 + x + 4 + 9 + y + 5 = (2+7+3+4+9+5) + x + y = 30 + x + y.
   We require that 30 + x + y is divisible by 9.
   So, 30 + x + y ≡ 0 (mod 9) => x + y ≡ -30 ≡ -3 ≡ 6 (mod 9) [since -3 mod 9 is 6, because 9-3=6].
   Therefore, x + y = 6 or 15 (since x and y are digits from 0 to 9, so maximum x+y=18, but 15 is possible and 6 is possible; 24 is too high).

3. **Divisibility by 11:**
   A number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits (from left to right) is divisible by 11.
   For N = 2 7 3 x 4 9 y 5, the alternating sum is:
      (2 + 3 + 4 + y) - (7 + x + 9 + 5) = (2+3+4+y) - (7+x+9+5) = (9 + y) - (21 + x) = 9 + y - 21 - x = -12 - x + y.
   We require that this is divisible by 11, so:
        -12 - x + y ≡ 0 (mod 11)
   => y - x - 12 ≡ 0 (mod 11)
   => y - x ≡ 12 (mod 11) => y - x ≡ 1 (mod 11)   [since 12 mod 11 = 1]

   Since y and x are digits (0 to 9), y - x can range from -9 to 9. The only values congruent to 1 mod 11 in this range are 1 and -10 (but -10 is not possible since y-x >= -9) and 12 is too high. So only possibility is y - x = 1.

   Therefore, we have:
        y = x + 1

4. Now combine with the condition from divisibility by 9:
   We have y = x + 1, and x + y = 6 or 15.

   Case 1: x + y = 6
        Substitute y = x+1: x + (x+1) = 6 => 2x + 1 = 6 => 2x = 5 => x=2.5, not an integer digit. So impossible.

   Case 2: x + y = 15
        Substitute y = x+1: x + (x+1) = 15 => 2x + 1 = 15 => 2x = 14 => x=7, then y=8.

   So x=7, y=8.

Therefore, the digits are x=7 and y=8.

Let's verify:
The number is 27374985.
Check divisibility:
- By 5: last digit 5, ok.
- By 9: sum of digits = 2+7+3+7+4+9+8+5 = 45, which is divisible by 9.
- By 11: alternating sum = (2+3+4+8) - (7+7+9+5) = (17) - (28) = -11, which is divisible by 11.
So indeed divisible by 495.

Final answer: x=7, y=8.
\boxed{7} \boxed{8}
