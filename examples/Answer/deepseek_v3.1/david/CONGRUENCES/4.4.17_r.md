I'll solve this system of linear congruences modulo 13.

**System:**
```
3x + 4y ≡ 5 (mod 13)
2x + 5y ≡ 7 (mod 13)
```

**Step 1: Solve using elimination method**

Multiply first equation by 2: `6x + 8y ≡ 10 (mod 13)`
Multiply second equation by 3: `6x + 15y ≡ 21 (mod 13) ≡ 8 (mod 13)`

Subtract: `(6x + 15y) - (6x + 8y) ≡ 8 - 10 (mod 13)`
`7y ≡ -2 (mod 13) ≡ 11 (mod 13)`

**Step 2: Solve for y**
`7y ≡ 11 (mod 13)`

Find inverse of 7 mod 13:
`7 × 2 = 14 ≡ 1 (mod 13)`, so inverse is 2.

Multiply both sides by 2:
`y ≡ 11 × 2 (mod 13) ≡ 22 (mod 13) ≡ 9 (mod 13)`

**Step 3: Solve for x**
Substitute y = 9 into first equation:
`3x + 4×9 ≡ 5 (mod 13)`
`3x + 36 ≡ 5 (mod 13)`
`3x + 10 ≡ 5 (mod 13)` (since 36 ≡ 10 mod 13)
`3x ≡ -5 (mod 13) ≡ 8 (mod 13)`

Find inverse of 3 mod 13:
`3 × 9 = 27 ≡ 1 (mod 13)`, so inverse is 9.

Multiply both sides by 9:
`x ≡ 8 × 9 (mod 13) ≡ 72 (mod 13) ≡ 7 (mod 13)` (since 72 ÷ 13 = 5 remainder 7)

**Step 4: Verify with second equation**
`2×7 + 5×9 ≡ 14 + 45 ≡ 59 (mod 13)`
`59 ÷ 13 = 4 remainder 7`, so `59 ≡ 7 (mod 13)` ✓

**Solution:**
```
x ≡ 7 (mod 13)
y ≡ 9 (mod 13)
```

**Lean 4 statement:**
```lean

**Normal language output:**
The system of congruences has the solution x ≡ 7 (mod 13) and y ≡ 9 (mod 13). This means x can be any number of the form 13k + 7 and y can be any number of the form 13m + 9, where k and m are integers.
