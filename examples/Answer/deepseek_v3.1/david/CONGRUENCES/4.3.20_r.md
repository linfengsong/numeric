I'll prove these statements about repunits $R_n$ (numbers consisting of n copies of the digit 1).

**Proof of (a):** $9 \mid R_n$ if and only if $9 \mid n$

A repunit $R_n$ can be expressed as:
$$R_n = \frac{10^n - 1}{9}$$

By the divisibility rule for 9, a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Since $R_n$ consists of n ones, the digit sum is exactly n.

Therefore:
$$9 \mid R_n \iff 9 \mid \text{(sum of digits of } R_n) \iff 9 \mid n$$

**Proof of (b):** $11 \mid R_n$ if and only if n is even

By the divisibility rule for 11, a number is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11.

For $R_n$ with digits $d_1d_2\cdots d_n$ where $d_i = 1$ for all i:
- If n is even: alternating sum = $(1-1)+(1-1)+\cdots+(1-1) = 0$, so divisible by 11
- If n is odd: alternating sum = $(1-1)+(1-1)+\cdots+1 = 1$, not divisible by 11

Therefore:
$$11 \mid R_n \iff \text{alternating sum of digits} \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \iff n \text{ is even}$$

```

**Normal language output:**

The proofs show that:
- A repunit $R_n$ is divisible by 9 exactly when n itself is divisible by 9, because the digit sum of $R_n$ is n.
- A repunit $R_n$ is divisible by 11 exactly when n is even, because the alternating digit sum equals 0 when n is even and equals 1 when n is odd.

These results follow directly from the standard divisibility rules for 9 and 11 applied to numbers consisting entirely of the digit 1.
