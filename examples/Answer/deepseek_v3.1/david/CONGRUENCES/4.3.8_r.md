I'll prove this statement and then provide a Lean 4 formalization.

**Proof:**

Let's analyze the expression a² - a + 7 modulo 10 (since we're interested in the last digit).

For any integer a, we can consider its residue modulo 10. Let's examine all 10 cases:

- a ≡ 0 mod 10: 0 - 0 + 7 ≡ 7 mod 10
- a ≡ 1 mod 10: 1 - 1 + 7 ≡ 7 mod 10
- a ≡ 2 mod 10: 4 - 2 + 7 ≡ 9 mod 10
- a ≡ 3 mod 10: 9 - 3 + 7 ≡ 13 ≡ 3 mod 10
- a ≡ 4 mod 10: 16 - 4 + 7 ≡ 19 ≡ 9 mod 10
- a ≡ 5 mod 10: 25 - 5 + 7 ≡ 27 ≡ 7 mod 10
- a ≡ 6 mod 10: 36 - 6 + 7 ≡ 37 ≡ 7 mod 10
- a ≡ 7 mod 10: 49 - 7 + 7 ≡ 49 ≡ 9 mod 10
- a ≡ 8 mod 10: 64 - 8 + 7 ≡ 63 ≡ 3 mod 10
- a ≡ 9 mod 10: 81 - 9 + 7 ≡ 79 ≡ 9 mod 10

In all cases, the result ends with 3, 7, or 9.

**Lean 4 Formalization:**

```lean
theorem ends_with_3_7_or_9 (a : ℤ) : a^2 - a + 7 % 10 ∈ ({3, 7, 9} : Set ℤ) := by
  have h : ∀ (r : ℤ), r ≥ 0 → r < 10 → (r^2 - r + 7) % 10 ∈ ({3, 7, 9} : Set ℤ) := by
    decide
  have := Int.emod_eq_of_lt (by omega) (h (a % 10) (Int.emod_nonneg a (by norm_num)) 
    (Int.emod_lt a (by norm_num)))
  exact this
```

**Normal Language Output:**

For any integer a, the expression a² - a + 7 always ends with either 3, 7, or 9. This can be verified by checking all possible last digits of a (0 through 9) and showing that in each case, the calculation results in a number ending with 3, 7, or 9. The pattern holds regardless of whether a is positive, negative, or zero.
