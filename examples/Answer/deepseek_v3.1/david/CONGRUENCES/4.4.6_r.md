Let's analyze the given conditions:

We are looking for the smallest integer \( a - 2 \) (which implies we are actually solving for \( a \), and then subtracting 2) such that:
1. \( 2 \mid a \)
2. \( 3 \mid a+1 \)
3. \( 4 \mid a+2 \)
4. \( 5 \mid a+3 \)
5. \( 6 \mid a+4 \)

Let's rewrite these conditions in terms of congruences:
- \( a \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \)
- \( a \equiv -1 \pmod{3} \)  i.e., \( a \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
- \( a \equiv -2 \pmod{4} \) i.e., \( a \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \)
- \( a \equiv -3 \pmod{5} \) i.e., \( a \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \)
- \( a \equiv -4 \pmod{6} \) i.e., \( a \equiv 2 \pmod{6} \)

Notice that all conditions (except the first) can be written as \( a \equiv 2 \pmod{m} \) for \( m = 3,4,5,6 \). Also, the first condition \( a \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \) is consistent with \( a \equiv 2 \pmod{2} \) (since 2 divides \(a-2\)), so actually all conditions are equivalent to:
\[
a \equiv 2 \pmod{m} \quad \text{for } m = 2,3,4,5,6
\]
This means that \(a-2\) is divisible by all of 2,3,4,5,6. Therefore, \(a-2\) must be a common multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.

Compute LCM(2,3,4,5,6):
- Prime factors: 
  - 2: 2
  - 3: 3
  - 4: \(2^2\)
  - 5: 5
  - 6: 2 * 3
So LCM = \(2^2 * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60\).

Thus, \(a-2\) must be a multiple of 60. The smallest such integer is 60 itself.

Therefore, \(a - 2 = 60\), so \(a = 62\).

Let's verify:
- \(2 \mid 62\) (true)
- \(3 \mid 63\) (true)
- \(4 \mid 64\) (true)
- \(5 \mid 65\) (true)
- \(6 \mid 66\) (true)

All conditions are satisfied.

So the smallest integer \(a-2\) is 60.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{60}
\]

In normal language: The smallest integer \(a - 2\) that satisfies all the given divisibility conditions is 60.
