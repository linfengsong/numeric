### Output in Normal Language

The statement is true for all integers \( n \). Here's why:

1. **Product of three consecutive integers is divisible by 6**:
   - Among any three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3.
   - Among any two consecutive integers, one is even (divisible by 2).
   - Since 2 and 3 are coprime, the product must be divisible by \(2 \times 3 = 6\).

2. **Product of four consecutive integers is divisible by 24**:
   - Among any four consecutive integers:
     - One is divisible by 4.
     - Another is divisible by 2 (but not necessarily 4).
     - One is divisible by 3.
   - So the product contains factors 4, 2, and 3, hence \(4 \times 2 \times 3 = 24\) divides it.
   - Alternatively, note that \(24 = 4!\), and the product of \(k\) consecutive integers is always divisible by \(k!\).

3. **Product of five consecutive integers is divisible by 120**:
   - Among any five consecutive integers:
     - One is divisible by 5.
     - One is divisible by 4.
     - One is divisible by 3.
     - One is divisible by 2.
   - So the product contains factors 5, 4, 3, and 2, hence \(5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 120\) divides it.
   - Again, this follows because \(120 = 5!\), and the product of \(k\) consecutive integers is divisible by \(k!\).

In general, the product of \(k\) consecutive integers is divisible by \(k!\) (which is the key reason these divisibility properties hold). This is because the product represents a binomial coefficient multiplied by \(k!\), which is an integer, or directly by the fact that in any set of \(k\) consecutive integers, there is one divisible by each integer up to \(k\).
