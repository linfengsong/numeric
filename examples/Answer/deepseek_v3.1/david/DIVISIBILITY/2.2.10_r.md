I will first prove this statement mathematically, then provide a Lean 4 formalization.

**Mathematical Proof:**

Let's show that n(7n² + 5) is divisible by 6 for all integers n ≥ 1.

We need to show divisibility by both 2 and 3:

1. **Divisibility by 2:**
   - If n is even, then n(7n² + 5) is even
   - If n is odd, then n is odd, n² is odd, 7n² is odd, so 7n² + 5 is even (odd + odd = even)
   - Thus in both cases, the product is divisible by 2

2. **Divisibility by 3:**
   Consider n modulo 3:
   - Case n ≡ 0 mod 3: then n(7n² + 5) ≡ 0 mod 3
   - Case n ≡ 1 mod 3: then 7n² + 5 ≡ 7(1) + 5 ≡ 12 ≡ 0 mod 3
   - Case n ≡ 2 mod 3: then 7n² + 5 ≡ 7(4) + 5 ≡ 28 + 5 ≡ 33 ≡ 0 mod 3
   - In all cases, either n ≡ 0 mod 3 or 7n² + 5 ≡ 0 mod 3

Since the expression is divisible by both 2 and 3, it's divisible by 6.

**Output:**

The integer n(7n² + 5) is indeed divisible by 6 for all integers n ≥ 1. This can be proven by showing that the expression is divisible by both 2 and 3:

1. For divisibility by 2: If n is even, the product is clearly even. If n is odd, then 7n² is odd and 7n² + 5 is even, making the product even.

2. For divisibility by 3: Considering n modulo 3, in all three cases (n ≡ 0, 1, or 2 mod 3), either n is divisible by 3 or 7n² + 5 is divisible by 3.

Since 2 and 3 are coprime, divisibility by both implies divisibility by their product 6. The Lean 4 proof formalizes this reasoning using modular arithmetic and case analysis.
