Let's solve each part step by step.

### (a) Dimes and Quarters Problem

Let \( d \) be the number of dimes and \( q \) be the number of quarters.
Each dime is \$0.10 and each quarter is \$0.25.
Total value: \( 0.10d + 0.25q = 4.55 \)
Multiply both sides by 100 to eliminate decimals:
\( 10d + 25q = 455 \)
Divide by 5:
\( 2d + 5q = 91 \)  ...(1)

We want to find integer solutions \( d \geq 0, q \geq 0 \).

Total number of coins: \( n = d + q \)

We need to find the maximum and minimum \( n \), and check if \( d = q \) is possible.

From (1): \( 2d = 91 - 5q \)  => \( d = \frac{91 - 5q}{2} \)
So \( 91 - 5q \) must be even and non-negative.

\( 91 \) is odd, \( 5q \) is odd if \( q \) is odd, even if \( q \) is even.
So \( 91 - 5q \) is even when \( q \) is odd.
Let \( q = 2k+1 \) (odd), then:
\( d = \frac{91 - 5(2k+1)}{2} = \frac{91 - 10k - 5}{2} = \frac{86 - 10k}{2} = 43 - 5k \)

We need \( d \geq 0 \) and \( q \geq 0 \):
\( 43 - 5k \geq 0 \) => \( k \leq 8.6 \), so \( k \leq 8 \)
\( q = 2k+1 \geq 0 \) always for \( k \geq 0 \).

So \( k = 0,1,...,8 \)

Then \( q = 1,3,5,...,17 \)
\( d = 43,38,33,...,3 \)

Total coins \( n = d + q = (43 - 5k) + (2k+1) = 44 - 3k \)

So \( n = 44 - 3k \) for \( k=0 \) to \( 8 \).

Maximum \( n \) when \( k=0 \): \( n = 44 \) (with \( d=43, q=1 \))
Minimum \( n \) when \( k=8 \): \( n = 44 - 24 = 20 \) (with \( d=3, q=17 \))

Check if \( d = q \) is possible:
Set \( d = q \), then from (1): \( 2d + 5d = 7d = 91 \) => \( d = 91/7 = 13 \)
So \( d = q = 13 \).
Check value: \( 0.10*13 + 0.25*13 = 1.30 + 3.25 = 4.55 \). Yes.

So:
- Maximum coins: 44
- Minimum coins: 20
- Yes, it is possible to have equal numbers (13 dimes and 13 quarters).

### (b) Theater Admissions Problem

Let \( a \) be number of adults, \( c \) be number of children.
Adults: \$1.80, Children: \$0.75
Total receipts: \( 1.80a + 0.75c = 90 \)
Multiply by 100: \( 180a + 75c = 9000 \)
Divide by 15: \( 12a + 5c = 600 \)  ...(1)

Also, \( a > c \).

We need integer solutions \( a \geq 1, c \geq 0 \).

From (1): \( 5c = 600 - 12a \) => \( c = \frac{600 - 12a}{5} = 120 - \frac{12a}{5} \)
So \( 12a \) must be divisible by 5, so \( a \) must be multiple of 5.
Let \( a = 5k \), then:
\( c = 120 - \frac{12*5k}{5} = 120 - 12k \)

We need \( c \geq 0 \): \( 120 - 12k \geq 0 \) => \( k \leq 10 \)
And \( a > c \): \( 5k > 120 - 12k \) => \( 17k > 120 \) => \( k > 120/17 \approx 7.06 \), so \( k \geq 8 \)

Also \( k \leq 10 \), so \( k = 8,9,10 \)

Check:
\( k=8 \): \( a=40, c=120-96=24 \), total people=64, and \( 40>24 \)
\( k=9 \): \( a=45, c=120-108=12 \), total=57, \( 45>12 \)
\( k=10 \): \( a=50, c=120-120=0 \), total=50, \( 50>0 \)

But "more adults than children" implies \( c>0 \) (since if no children, it's not "more than"), so \( k=10 \) is borderline. Probably exclude \( c=0 \).

So valid: \( k=8 \) and \( k=9 \).

The problem asks: "how many people attended?" But there are multiple possibilities.

Wait: "assuming that more adults than children were present" and both are positive? Usually "children" implies at least one.

So two cases: 64 people (40 adults, 24 children) or 57 people (45 adults, 12 children).

But is there additional constraint? The total receipts are exactly 90.

Check both:
40 adults: 40*1.80=72, 24 children:24*0.75=18, total=90.
45 adults:81, 12 children:9, total=90.

So both are possible. But perhaps the problem expects one answer? Maybe "more adults than children" strictly, and children present.

Perhaps the problem implies both groups present? "adults and children" might imply both.

So both are valid. But let's see if we can find which one.

Perhaps the problem has a unique solution? Or maybe I missed something.

Another way: from \( c=120-12k \), and \( a=5k \), total people \( n=5k + 120-12k=120-7k \)

For k=8, n=120-56=64
k=9, n=120-63=57
k=10, n=120-70=50

All work with a>c.

But if we require c>=1, then k<=9.

So k=8 or 9.

Perhaps the problem has a typo or I need to see.

Wait: "more adults than children" and both present, so k=8 or 9.

But the problem asks "how many people attended?" which is not unique.

Perhaps I should list both.

But let's see the answer expected.

Maybe I can solve.

Another thought: "neighborhood theater" might have integer people.

Both are integer.

Perhaps the problem is from a contest and has unique answer.

Let's check the difference: for k=8, a=40,c=24
k=9,a=45,c=12

Both are valid.

But perhaps "more adults than children" is satisfied.

Maybe the problem means strictly more adults than children, and children are present, so k=8 or 9.

But then two answers.

Perhaps I need to see the minimum or maximum.

But the problem doesn't say.

Wait, maybe I misread: "assuming that more adults than children were present" - this is given, so a>c.

So both.

But perhaps the problem has only one solution if we require that both are present and a>c.

So 64 or 57.

Perhaps the answer is 64.

Or maybe I can see the ratio.

Not sure.

Let's assume that children are present, so c>=1, so k<=9.

And a>c, so for k=9, a=45>12, ok.
k=8, a=40>24, ok.

So two.

Perhaps the problem is to find the number, and it is not unique.

But let's see part (c).

Perhaps for (b), the answer is 64.

I recall that sometimes these problems have unique answer.

Let's solve (1): 12a+5c=600.

a and c integers.

a must be multiple of 5, say a=5t, then c=120-12t.

c>=0, so t<=10.
a>c: 5t >120-12t, 17t>120, t>=8 (since t integer)

So t=8,9,10.

t=10: c=0, not children present.
So t=8 or 9.

So two possibilities.

Perhaps the problem has "more adults than children" and we need to find how many attended, but it is not unique.

Maybe the problem is from a source where answer is given.

Perhaps I can write both.

But let's move to (c).

### (c) Sixes and Nines Problem

Let \( x \) be number of sixes, \( y \) be number of nines.
Sum: \( 6x + 9y = 126 \)  ...(1)
Interchanged: \( 6y + 9x = 114 \)  ...(2)

Simplify (1): divide by 3: \( 2x + 3y = 42 \)  (1')
(2): divide by 3: \( 2y + 3x = 38 \)  (2')

Now we have:
(1'): \( 2x + 3y = 42 \)
(2'): \( 3x + 2y = 38 \)

Solve these two equations.

Multiply (1') by 2 and (2') by 3:
4x + 6y = 84
9x + 6y = 114

Subtract first from second:
5x = 30  => x = 6

Then from (1'): 2*6 + 3y =42 => 12+3y=42 => 3y=30 => y=10

So originally, there were 6 sixes and 10 nines.

Check: 6*6 + 9*10 =36+90=126.
Interchanged: 6*10 +9*6=60+54=114. Correct.

### Final Answers:

(a) Maximum number of coins: 44 (43 dimes and 1 quarter)
    Minimum number of coins: 20 (3 dimes and 17 quarters)
    Yes, it is possible to have 13 dimes and 13 quarters.

(b) There are two possibilities:
    - 40 adults and 24 children, total 64 people.
    - 45 adults and 12 children, total 57 people.
    (Both satisfy the conditions.)

(c) Originally, there were 6 sixes and 10 nines.

For (b), since the problem asks "how many people attended?" and there are two answers, perhaps it is ambiguous. But typically, such problems have unique answer, so maybe I need to see.

Perhaps "more adults than children" and both groups present, so exclude c=0, so two.

But let's assume the answer is 64.

Perhaps the problem has " how many people attended?" and we need to find.

I think it's fine.

So for output:

(a) The maximum number of coins is 44, and the minimum is 20. It is possible for the number of dimes to equal the number of quarters, specifically 13 each.

(b) The number of people who attended could be 64 (40 adults and 24 children) or 57 (45 adults and 12 children).

(c) There were originally 6 sixes and 10 nines.

For (b), if we require that children are present, both are valid. If we allow no children, then also 50 (50 adults,0 children) but that may not be "children".

So I'll go with two answers.

### Lean Statement (for verification):

For (a):
```lean
-- Define the equation: 2d + 5q = 91
-- Maximum coins: d=43,q=1 -> 44
-- Minimum coins: d=3,q=17 -> 20
-- Equal: d=13,q=13
```

For (b):
```lean
-- Equation: 12a + 5c = 600
-- Solutions: (a=40,c=24) and (a=45,c=12)
```

For (c):
```lean
-- Equations: 2x+3y=42 and 3x+2y=38
-- Solution: x=6,y=10
```

### Normal Language Output:

(a) The man can have a maximum of 44 coins (43 dimes and 1 quarter) and a minimum of 20 coins (3 dimes and 17 quarters). It is possible for the number of dimes to equal the number of quarters, which is 13 each.

(b) The number of people who attended could be either 64 (comprising 40 adults and 24 children) or 57 (comprising 45 adults and 12 children), both satisfying the conditions that more adults than children were present and total receipts were $90.

(c) There were originally 6 sixes and 10 nines.
