**Theorem 1:** For any positive integer \( n \) and any integer \( a \), the greatest common divisor \( \gcd(a, a+n) \) divides \( n \).

**Proof:**  
Let \( d = \gcd(a, a+n) \). Since \( d \) divides both \( a \) and \( a+n \), it also divides their difference \( (a+n) - a = n \). Therefore, \( d \mid n \).

**Theorem 2:** For any integer \( a \), \( \gcd(a, a+1) = 1 \).

**Proof:**  
By Theorem 1 with \( n = 1 \), \( \gcd(a, a+1) \) divides 1. The only positive divisors of 1 are 1 itself. Since \( \gcd \) is always non-negative and \( \gcd(a, a+1) \geq 1 \) (as it divides 1 and is positive when \( a \) and \( a+1 \) are not both zero, which they never are), we conclude \( \gcd(a, a+1) = 1 \).

This shows that consecutive integers are always coprime.
