### Step-by-Step Proof

We want to prove:  
If \( d \) is a common divisor of \( a \) and \( b \), then \( d = \gcd(a, b) \) if and only if \( \gcd\left(\frac{a}{d}, \frac{b}{d}\right) = 1 \).

---

#### Part 1: If \( d = \gcd(a, b) \), then \( \gcd\left(\frac{a}{d}, \frac{b}{d}\right) = 1 \).

Let \( d = \gcd(a, b) \). Then \( d \mid a \) and \( d \mid b \), so \( \frac{a}{d} \) and \( \frac{b}{d} \) are integers.  
Suppose for contradiction that \( \gcd\left(\frac{a}{d}, \frac{b}{d}\right) = k > 1 \). Then \( k \mid \frac{a}{d} \) and \( k \mid \frac{b}{d} \), so \( kd \mid a \) and \( kd \mid b \).  
But \( k > 1 \) implies \( kd > d \), contradicting that \( d \) is the greatest common divisor.  
Hence, \( \gcd\left(\frac{a}{d}, \frac{b}{d}\right) = 1 \).

---

#### Part 2: If \( \gcd\left(\frac{a}{d}, \frac{b}{d}\right) = 1 \), then \( d = \gcd(a, b) \).

Let \( d \) be a common divisor of \( a \) and \( b \), and assume \( \gcd\left(\frac{a}{d}, \frac{b}{d}\right) = 1 \).  
Let \( g = \gcd(a, b) \). Since \( d \) is a common divisor, \( d \mid g \). Write \( g = d \cdot k \) for some integer \( k \).  
Then \( g \mid a \) and \( g \mid b \), so \( k \mid \frac{a}{d} \) and \( k \mid \frac{b}{d} \).  
But \( \gcd\left(\frac{a}{d}, \frac{b}{d}\right) = 1 \), so \( k = 1 \). Therefore, \( g = d \), i.e., \( d = \gcd(a, b) \).

---

### ✅ Conclusion

We have shown both directions:  
- If \( d = \gcd(a, b) \), then \( \gcd\left(\frac{a}{d}, \frac{b}{d}\right) = 1 \).  
- If \( \gcd\left(\frac{a}{d}, \frac{b}{d}\right) = 1 \), then \( d = \gcd(a, b) \).  

Hence, \( d = \gcd(a, b) \) if and only if \( \gcd\left(\frac{a}{d}, \frac{b}{d}\right) = 1 \).

### Output in Normal Language

The statement is:  
If \( d \) is a common divisor of \( a \) and \( b \), then \( d \) is the greatest common divisor of \( a \) and \( b \) if and only if the numbers \( \frac{a}{d} \) and \( \frac{b}{d} \) are coprime (i.e., their gcd is 1).

**Explanation:**  
- If \( d \) is the gcd, then dividing \( a \) and \( b \) by \( d \) leaves no common factors other than 1.  
- Conversely, if after dividing by \( d \) the results are coprime, then \( d \) must be the largest common divisor.  

This is a fundamental property often used to simplify fractions or in number theory proofs.
