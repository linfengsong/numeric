### Proof Sketch

We aim to prove that the sum of the reciprocals of the first \( n \) triangular numbers is less than 2. The \( k \)-th triangular number is \( t_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \), so its reciprocal is \( \frac{2}{k(k+1)} \). The sum becomes:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2}{k(k+1)}.
\]

**Key Steps:**
1. **Telescoping Series:** Observe that \( \frac{2}{k(k+1)} = 2\left( \frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{k+1} \right) \). This allows the sum to telescope:
   \[
   S_n = 2\left(1 - \frac{1}{n+1}\right) = 2 - \frac{2}{n+1}.
   \]
2. **Upper Bound:** Since \( \frac{2}{n+1} > 0 \) for all \( n \geq 1 \), we have:
   \[
   S_n = 2 - \frac{2}{n+1} < 2.
   \]
3. **Limit as \( n \to \infty \):** The infinite sum converges to 2:
   \[
   \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = 2.
   \]
   Thus, the finite sum is always strictly less than 2.

### Complete Proof

The \( k \)-th triangular number is \( t_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \), so:
\[
\frac{1}{t_k} = \frac{2}{k(k+1)} = 2\left( \frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{k+1} \right).
\]
Therefore, the sum \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{t_k} \) becomes:
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n 2\left( \frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{k+1} \right) = 2\left( \left( \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} \right) + \cdots + \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right) \right).
\]
This telescopes to:
\[
S_n = 2\left(1 - \frac{1}{n+1}\right) = 2 - \frac{2}{n+1}.
\]
Since \( \frac{2}{n+1} > 0 \) for all \( n \geq 1 \), it follows that:
\[
S_n < 2.
\]
Moreover, as \( n \to \infty \), \( S_n \to 2 \), so the sum is always strictly less than 2 for any finite \( n \).

### Output in Normal Language
The sum of the reciprocals of the first \( n \) triangular numbers is exactly \( 2 - \frac{2}{n+1} \), which is always less than 2 for all positive integers \( n \). As \( n \) increases, the sum approaches 2 but never reaches it.
