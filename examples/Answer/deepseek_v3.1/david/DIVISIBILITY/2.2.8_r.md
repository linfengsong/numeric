Let the sequence be defined as numbers of the form:
\[ a_n = \underbrace{11\ldots1}_{n \text{ ones}} = \frac{10^n - 1}{9} \quad \text{for } n \geq 2. \]
We want to prove that for \( n \geq 2 \), \( a_n \) is never a perfect square.

**Proof by contradiction:**
Assume \( a_n = k^2 \) for some integer \( k \geq 1 \). Then:
\[ \frac{10^n - 1}{9} = k^2 \implies 10^n - 1 = 9k^2. \]
So \( 10^n \equiv 1 \pmod{9} \), which is true since \( 10 \equiv 1 \pmod{9} \).

Now consider modulo 4:
- \( 10^n \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \) for \( n \geq 2 \) (since \( 10^n \) is divisible by 100).
- So \( 10^n - 1 \equiv -1 \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).
- Therefore \( 9k^2 \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).
- But \( 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( k^2 \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

However, squares modulo 4 are only \( 0 \) or \( 1 \), never \( 3 \). This is a contradiction.

Therefore, our assumption that \( a_n \) is a perfect square is false. Hence, no integer in the sequence \( 11, 111, 1111, \ldots \) is a perfect square.

**Output in Normal Language:**
The proof shows that assuming any number in the sequence (for \( n \geq 2 \)) is a perfect square leads to a contradiction modulo 4. Specifically, the number \( 10^n - 1 \) is congruent to 3 modulo 4, but \( 9k^2 \) would require \( k^2 \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \), which is impossible since squares modulo 4 are only 0 or 1. Therefore, no such integer \( k \) exists, and the sequence contains no perfect squares.
