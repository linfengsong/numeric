I will prove both statements using properties of prime factorizations and the definition of the greatest common divisor.

### (a) If gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd(aⁿ, bⁿ) = 1

**Proof:**
Since gcd(a, b) = 1, a and b have no prime factors in common. Let:
- a = p₁ᵏ¹ p₂ᵏ² ... pᵣᵏʳ
- b = q₁ˡ¹ q₂ˡ² ... qₛˡˢ

where all pᵢ and qⱼ are distinct primes.

Then:
- aⁿ = p₁ⁿᵏ¹ p₂ⁿᵏ² ... pᵣⁿᵏʳ
- bⁿ = q₁ⁿˡ¹ q₂ⁿˡ² ... qₛⁿˡˢ

Since all primes pᵢ and qⱼ are distinct, aⁿ and bⁿ have no prime factors in common. Therefore, gcd(aⁿ, bⁿ) = 1.

### (b) If aⁿ | bⁿ, then a | b

**Proof:**
Assume aⁿ | bⁿ, so there exists an integer k such that bⁿ = k·aⁿ.

Let d = gcd(a, b). Write:
- a = d·a₁
- b = d·b₁

where gcd(a₁, b₁) = 1.

Then:
bⁿ = (d·b₁)ⁿ = dⁿ·b₁ⁿ
aⁿ = (d·a₁)ⁿ = dⁿ·a₁ⁿ

Since aⁿ | bⁿ, we have:
dⁿ·b₁ⁿ = k·dⁿ·a₁ⁿ ⇒ b₁ⁿ = k·a₁ⁿ

Thus a₁ⁿ | b₁ⁿ. But from part (a), since gcd(a₁, b₁) = 1, we have gcd(a₁ⁿ, b₁ⁿ) = 1. The only way a₁ⁿ can divide b₁ⁿ when they are coprime is if a₁ⁿ = 1, which implies a₁ = 1.

Therefore a = d·a₁ = d·1 = d, and since b = d·b₁ = a·b₁, we conclude that a | b.

### Lean Statement

```lean
theorem part_a (a b n : ℕ) (ha : a ≥ 1) (hb : b ≥ 1) (hn : n ≥ 1) 
  (h : gcd a b = 1) : gcd (a^n) (b^n) = 1 := by
  -- Proof using prime factorization properties

theorem part_b (a b n : ℕ) (ha : a ≥ 1) (hb : b ≥ 1) (hn : n ≥ 1) 
  (h : a^n ∣ b^n) : a ∣ b := by
  -- Proof using the gcd decomposition and part_a
```

### Normal Language Output

**Part (a):** If two positive integers a and b are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), then any positive powers aⁿ and bⁿ of these numbers will also be coprime. This is because raising numbers to powers doesn't introduce any new common prime factors - if they had no primes in common originally, they still won't after being raised to any power.

**Part (b):** If aⁿ divides bⁿ for some positive integer n, then a must divide b. This means that if one number raised to a power divides another number raised to the same power, then the original first number must divide the original second number. The proof works by considering the greatest common divisor of a and b and showing that the only way the divisibility relationship can hold is if a itself divides b.
