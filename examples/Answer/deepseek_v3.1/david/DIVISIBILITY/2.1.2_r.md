### Step 1: Understand the Definitions

- **Triangular number**: The nth triangular number is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers:
  \[
  t_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
  \]

- **Binomial coefficient**:
  \[
  \binom{n+1}{2} = \frac{(n+1)!}{2!(n-1)!} = \frac{(n+1) \cdot n}{2}
  \]

### Step 2: Direct Comparison

From the formulas:
\[
t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}, \quad \binom{n+1}{2} = \frac{(n+1)n}{2}
\]
These are clearly equal.

### Step 3: Combinatorial Interpretation (Optional Insight)

- \( \binom{n+1}{2} \) counts the number of ways to choose 2 distinct objects from \( n+1 \) objects.
- Alternatively, this equals the number of pairs \( (i, j) \) with \( 1 \leq i < j \leq n+1 \).
- The number of pairs where the larger number is \( k \) (with \( k \) from 2 to \( n+1 \)) is \( k-1 \).
- So the total number is \( 1 + 2 + \cdots + n = t_n \).

Thus, \( t_n = \binom{n+1}{2} \).

### Step 4: Formal Proof in Lean

We can prove this in Lean by showing both sides are equal to \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

```lean
import Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Basic
import Mathlib.Data.Nat.Choose.Sum

    rw [choose_eq_choose_symm (by omega), choose_two_right]
  rw [sum_formula, binom_formula]
  ring
```

**Explanation of the Lean code:**
1. We use the known formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers: \( \sum_{k=0}^n k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
2. The binomial coefficient \( \binom{n+1}{2} = \frac{(n+1)n}{2} \).
3. Both expressions are equal, so we rewrite both and use `ring` to confirm the equality.

### Step 5: Final Statement

We have shown algebraically and combinatorially that:
\[
t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \binom{n+1}{2}
\]
Hence, the statement is proved.

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{t_n = \binom{n+1}{2}}
\]

**Normal language output:**  
The nth triangular number \( t_n \), which is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), is exactly equal to the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n+1}{2} \). This holds for all integers \( n \geq 1 \).
