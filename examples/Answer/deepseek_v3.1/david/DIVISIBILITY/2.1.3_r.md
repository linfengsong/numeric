### Step 1: Understand the Formula

The triangular number \( t_k \) is given by:
\[
t_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}
\]
So, the sum of the first \( n \) triangular numbers is:
\[
S = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + \ldots + t_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}
\]

---

### Step 2: Expand the Summand

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{n} (k^2 + k)
\]

---

### Step 3: Use Known Summation Formulas

We know:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}
\]

So,
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} (k^2 + k) = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} + \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

---

### Step 4: Combine the Terms

Factor out \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{6} \):
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} (k^2 + k) = \frac{n(n + 1)}{6} \left[ (2n + 1) + 3 \right] = \frac{n(n + 1)}{6} (2n + 4) = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 4)}{6}
\]

Simplify \( 2n + 4 = 2(n + 2) \):
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} (k^2 + k) = \frac{n(n + 1) \cdot 2(n + 2)}{6} = \frac{2n(n + 1)(n + 2)}{6}
\]

Now multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \) (from Step 2):
\[
S = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2n(n + 1)(n + 2)}{6} = \frac{n(n + 1)(n + 2)}{6}
\]

---

### Step 5: Final Result

\[
t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + \ldots + t_n = \frac{n(n + 1)(n + 2)}{6}
\]

### ðŸ“˜ Output in Normal Language

The sum of the first \( n \) triangular numbers \( t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_n \) is equal to \( \frac{n(n + 1)(n + 2)}{6} \), where \( n \geq 1 \). This formula was derived by expanding the expression for each triangular number, applying known summation formulas for integers and squares, and simplifying the result. The derivation confirms the identity attributed to the Hindu mathematician Aryabhata.
