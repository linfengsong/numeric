I will prove the statement: If \(a\) and \(b\) are relatively prime positive integers, then the Diophantine equation \(ax - by = c\) has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers.

**Proof:**

Since \(a\) and \(b\) are relatively prime, \(\gcd(a,b) = 1\). Therefore, for any integer \(c\), the equation \(ax - by = c\) has integer solutions.

Let \((x_0, y_0)\) be a particular solution to \(ax - by = c\). Then all solutions are given by:
\[
x = x_0 + bt,\quad y = y_0 + at,\quad \text{for any integer } t.
\]

We need to show that there are infinitely many positive integer solutions, i.e., infinitely many \(t\) such that \(x > 0\) and \(y > 0\).

Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, as \(t\) increases, \(x\) increases and \(y\) increases. Similarly, as \(t\) decreases, \(x\) decreases and \(y\) decreases.

Choose \(t\) sufficiently large so that:
\[
x_0 + bt > 0 \quad \text{and} \quad y_0 + at > 0.
\]
This is always possible because \(b > 0\) and \(a > 0\). Specifically, for all \(t > T\) where \(T = \max\left(-\frac{x_0}{b}, -\frac{y_0}{a}\right)\), we have \(x > 0\) and \(y > 0\). Since there are infinitely many integers \(t > T\), there are infinitely many positive solutions.

Therefore, the equation \(ax - by = c\) has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers.

**Lean Statement:**

    ∃ (f : ℕ → ℕ × ℕ), (∀ n, a * (f n).1 - b * (f n).2 = c) ∧ (∀ n, (f n).1 > 0 ∧ (f n).2 > 0) ∧

  -- Proof would involve:
  -- 1. Using Bézout's identity to find a particular solution (x₀, y₀)
  -- 2. Defining f(n) = (x₀ + b * n, y₀ + a * n) for n sufficiently large
  -- 3. Showing that for large n, both coordinates are positive
  -- 4. Showing that all these are distinct

```

**Output in normal language:**
The proof shows that when \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime positive integers, the linear Diophantine equation \(ax - by = c\) always has infinitely many positive integer solutions \((x,y)\). This is because the general solution can be expressed as \(x = x_0 + bt\), \(y = y_0 + at\) for integer \(t\), and by choosing \(t\) sufficiently large, both \(x\) and \(y\) become positive. Since there are infinitely many such \(t\) values, there are infinitely many positive solutions.
