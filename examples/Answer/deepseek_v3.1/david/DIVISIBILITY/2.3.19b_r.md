### Step 1: Understand the Goal

We want to show that if \( a \) is an odd integer, then \( 24 \) divides \( a(a^2 - 1) \). That is, \( 24 \mid a(a^2 - 1) \).

---

### Step 2: Factor the Expression

Note that:
\[
a(a^2 - 1) = a(a - 1)(a + 1)
\]
This is the product of three consecutive integers. Since \( a \) is odd, \( a-1 \) and \( a+1 \) are even. In fact, among three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3.

---

### Step 3: Show Divisibility by 3

Among any three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3. So \( 3 \mid (a-1)a(a+1) \).

---

### Step 4: Show Divisibility by 8

Since \( a \) is odd, let \( a = 2k + 1 \). Then:
\[
a-1 = 2k, \quad a+1 = 2k + 2 = 2(k+1)
\]
So \( a(a^2 - 1) = (2k+1) \cdot 2k \cdot 2(k+1) = 4k(k+1)(2k+1) \).

Now, \( k(k+1) \) is the product of two consecutive integers, so it is even. Therefore, \( k(k+1) \) is divisible by 2, meaning \( 4k(k+1) \) is divisible by 8. Hence, \( 8 \mid a(a^2 - 1) \).

---

### Step 5: Combine the Results

We have:
- \( 3 \mid a(a^2 - 1) \)
- \( 8 \mid a(a^2 - 1) \)

Since 3 and 8 are coprime, their product divides \( a(a^2 - 1) \). That is:
\[
24 \mid a(a^2 - 1)
\]

```

**Note:** The Lean proof above assumes some helper lemmas (e.g., `even_of_consecutive`, `divisible_by_three_of_consecutive`). In a full formalization, these would need to be defined or imported.

### üìù Output in Normal Language

If \( a \) is an odd integer, then \( a(a^2 - 1) \) is divisible by 24. This is because:
- \( a(a^2 - 1) = (a-1)a(a+1) \) is the product of three consecutive integers.
- Among any three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3.
- Since \( a \) is odd, \( a-1 \) and \( a+1 \) are even. In fact, one of them is divisible by 4, and the other by 2, so their product is divisible by 8.
- Because 3 and 8 are coprime, their product 24 divides \( a(a^2 - 1) \).

Thus, \( 24 \mid a(a^2 - 1) \) for any odd integer \( a \).
