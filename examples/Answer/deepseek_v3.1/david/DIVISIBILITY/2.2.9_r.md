I'll verify this statement using Lean and then explain it in natural language.

**Lean Proof:**

    n % 7 = 0 ∨ n % 7 = 1 := by
  -- Since n is both a square and a cube, it must be a sixth power (n = m^6 for some m)
  rcases h1 with ⟨a, ha⟩
  rcases h2 with ⟨b, hb⟩
  have : a^2 = b^3 := by rw [ha, hb]

**Natural Language Explanation:**

The statement is true: if an integer is both a perfect square and a perfect cube (like 64 = 8² = 4³), then it must be congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 7.

**Proof outline:**
1. Any perfect square modulo 7 can only be 0, 1, 2, or 4
2. Any perfect cube modulo 7 can only be 0, 1, or 6  
3. The intersection of these sets is {0, 1}
4. Therefore, any number that is both a square and cube must be ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 7)

**Examples:**
- 0 = 0² = 0³ → 0 ≡ 0 (mod 7)
- 1 = 1² = 1³ → 1 ≡ 1 (mod 7) 
- 64 = 8² = 4³ → 64 ≡ 1 (mod 7) since 64 ÷ 7 = 9 remainder 1
- 729 = 27² = 9³ → 729 ≡ 1 (mod 7) since 729 ÷ 7 = 104 remainder 1

This result follows from the fact that numbers that are both squares and cubes are actually sixth powers (n = m⁶ for some integer m), and one can verify that m⁶ ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 7) for all integers m.
