### Step-by-Step Proof Sketch

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to show that if an integer \( n \) is both a perfect square and a perfect cube (i.e., \( n = a^2 = b^3 \) for some integers \( a, b \)), then \( n \) must be congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 7.

2. **Key Insight**: Since \( n \) is both a square and a cube, it must be a perfect sixth power (because the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6). So, \( n = c^6 \) for some integer \( c \).

3. **Modulo 7 Analysis**: Consider the possible residues of \( c \) modulo 7. The integers modulo 7 are \( \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \). Compute \( c^6 \mod 7 \) for each residue:
   - \( 0^6 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 1^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 2^6 = 64 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 3^6 = 729 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 4^6 = (4^3)^2 = 64^2 \equiv 1^2 = 1 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 5^6 = (5^2)^3 = 25^3 \equiv 4^3 = 64 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 6^6 = (-1)^6 = 1 \mod 7 \)

4. **Conclusion**: For any integer \( c \), \( c^6 \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \mod 7 \). Therefore, \( n = c^6 \) must be of the form \( 7k \) or \( 7k + 1 \).

### Output in Normal Language
If an integer is both a square and a cube (like \(64 = 8^2 = 4^3\)), then it must be a sixth power (\(n = c^6\)). For any integer \(c\), \(c^6\) modulo 7 is always 0 or 1. Therefore, \(n\) is either a multiple of 7 or one more than a multiple of 7, i.e., of the form \(7k\) or \(7k + 1\).
