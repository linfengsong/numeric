Let \( a \) be an odd integer. We want to show that the expression
\[
S = a^2 + (a+2)^2 + (a+4)^2 + 1
\]
is divisible by 12.

First, expand each term:
\[
a^2 = a^2
\]
\[
(a+2)^2 = a^2 + 4a + 4
\]
\[
(a+4)^2 = a^2 + 8a + 16
\]
So,
\[
S = a^2 + (a^2 + 4a + 4) + (a^2 + 8a + 16) + 1 = 3a^2 + 12a + 21
\]

Now, factor out 3:
\[
S = 3(a^2 + 4a + 7)
\]
So, \( S \) is divisible by 3. To show divisibility by 12, we need to show that \( S \) is also divisible by 4 (since \(12 = 3 \times 4\)).

Now, since \( a \) is odd, let \( a = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). Substitute:
\[
a^2 + 4a + 7 = (2k+1)^2 + 4(2k+1) + 7 = (4k^2 + 4k + 1) + (8k + 4) + 7 = 4k^2 + 12k + 12
\]
So,
\[
S = 3(4k^2 + 12k + 12) = 12(k^2 + 3k + 3)
\]
This is clearly divisible by 12.

Therefore, \( S \) is divisible by 12.

**Lean Statement:**
```lean
theorem odd_square_sum_divisible_by_12 (a : ℤ) (ha : a % 2 = 1) :
    12 ∣ (a^2 + (a + 2)^2 + (a + 4)^2 + 1) := by

```

**Output in Normal Language:**
Given an odd integer \( a \), the expression \( a^2 + (a+2)^2 + (a+4)^2 + 1 \) simplifies to \( 12(k^2 + 3k + 3) \) where \( a = 2k + 1 \), which is clearly divisible by 12. Therefore, the statement holds.
