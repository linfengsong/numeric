I'll find the least common multiple (LCM) for each pair of numbers.

**1. lcm(143, 227)**

First, let's check if these numbers are coprime:
- 143 = 11 × 13
- 227 is a prime number

Since they have no common factors, lcm(143, 227) = 143 × 227 = 32,461

**2. lcm(306, 657)**

Let's find the prime factors:
- 306 = 2 × 3² × 17
- 657 = 3² × 73

The highest powers are: 2¹, 3², 17¹, 73¹
lcm(306, 657) = 2 × 3² × 17 × 73 = 2 × 9 × 17 × 73 = 2 × 9 = 18, 18 × 17 = 306, 306 × 73 = 22,338

**3. lcm(272, 1479)**

Let's find the prime factors:
- 272 = 2⁴ × 17
- 1479 = 3 × 17 × 29

The highest powers are: 2⁴, 3¹, 17¹, 29¹
lcm(272, 1479) = 2⁴ × 3 × 17 × 29 = 16 × 3 × 17 × 29 = 16 × 3 = 48, 48 × 17 = 816, 816 × 29 = 23,664

**Final Answers:**
- lcm(143, 227) = 32,461
- lcm(306, 657) = 22,338
- lcm(272, 1479) = 23,664
