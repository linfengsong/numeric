I'll prove this statement using Lean and then explain it in natural language.

### Lean Proof
```lean
theorem one_of_a_a2_a4_divisible_by_3 (a : ℤ) : ∃ (x : ℤ), (x = a ∨ x = a + 2 ∨ x = a + 4) ∧ 3 ∣ x := by
  have h : a % 3 = 0 ∨ a % 3 = 1 ∨ a % 3 = 2 := by
    have := Int.emod_lt a (by norm_num : 0 < 3)
    omega
    
  rcases h with (h | h | h)
  · refine ⟨a, Or.inl rfl, ?_⟩
    rw [← Int.emod_eq_zero_of_dvd]
    exact h
  · refine ⟨a + 2, Or.inr (Or.inl rfl), ?_⟩
    rw [Int.dvd_iff_emod_eq_zero, show (a + 2) % 3 = 0 from ?_]
    rw [Int.add_emod, h]
    norm_num
  · refine ⟨a + 4, Or.inr (Or.inr rfl), ?_⟩
    rw [Int.dvd_iff_emod_eq_zero, show (a + 4) % 3 = 0 from ?_]
    rw [Int.add_emod, h]
    norm_num
```

### Natural Language Explanation

**Proof:** For any integer a, when we divide it by 3, the remainder must be 0, 1, or 2 (by the division algorithm).

- **Case 1:** If a ≡ 0 mod 3, then a is divisible by 3
- **Case 2:** If a ≡ 1 mod 3, then a + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 ≡ 3 ≡ 0 mod 3, so a + 2 is divisible by 3
- **Case 3:** If a ≡ 2 mod 3, then a + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 ≡ 6 ≡ 0 mod 3, so a + 4 is divisible by 3

Since these three cases cover all possibilities, at least one of the numbers a, a+2, or a+4 must be divisible by 3 for any integer a.

**Example:** 
- If a = 5 (remainder 2), then a+4 = 9 is divisible by 3
- If a = 7 (remainder 1), then a+2 = 9 is divisible by 3  
- If a = 9 (remainder 0), then a itself is divisible by 3

The Lean proof formalizes this reasoning using modular arithmetic properties.
