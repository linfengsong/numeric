### Step-by-Step Proof and Examples

#### (a) Proof that if \( t_n \) is a perfect square, then \( t_{4n(n+1)} \) is also a square

**Triangular Number Definition:**
The \( k \)-th triangular number is given by:
\[
t_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
\]

**Given:**
\( t_n \) is a perfect square, so there exists an integer \( m \) such that:
\[
\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = m^2
\]

**Goal:**
Show that \( t_{4n(n+1)} \) is a perfect square.

Let \( N = 4n(n+1) \). Then:
\[
t_N = \frac{N(N+1)}{2} = \frac{4n(n+1) \cdot (4n(n+1) + 1)}{2}
\]

Now, compute \( N+1 \):
\[
N + 1 = 4n(n+1) + 1
\]

So,
\[
t_N = \frac{4n(n+1) \cdot (4n(n+1) + 1)}{2}
\]

We aim to express \( t_N \) as a perfect square. Notice from the given:
\[
n(n+1) = 2m^2
\]
Substitute this into \( t_N \):

First, \( N = 4n(n+1) = 4 \cdot 2m^2 = 8m^2 \)

Next, \( N + 1 = 8m^2 + 1 \)

Thus,
\[
t_N = \frac{8m^2 \cdot (8m^2 + 1)}{2} = 4m^2 \cdot (8m^2 + 1)
\]

This does not immediately appear as a square. Let's try a different approach.

**Alternate Approach:**
We know:
\[
t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = m^2
\implies n(n+1) = 2m^2
\]

Now consider \( t_{4n(n+1)} = t_{4 \cdot 2m^2} = t_{8m^2} \):
\[
t_{8m^2} = \frac{8m^2 \cdot (8m^2 + 1)}{2} = 4m^2 (8m^2 + 1)
\]

We need to show this is a perfect square. Notice:
\[
4m^2 (8m^2 + 1) = (2m)^2 \cdot (8m^2 + 1)
\]

But \( 8m^2 + 1 \) is not necessarily a square. However, wait: there is a known identity.

Actually, from the given condition, we can derive:
\[
t_{4n(n+1)} = \left(2m(2n+1)\right)^2
\]

Let's verify:
\[
t_{4n(n+1)} = \frac{4n(n+1) \cdot (4n(n+1) + 1)}{2}
\]

But \( n(n+1) = 2m^2 \), so:
\[
4n(n+1) = 8m^2
\]
\[
4n(n+1) + 1 = 8m^2 + 1
\]

So,
\[
t_{4n(n+1)} = \frac{8m^2 \cdot (8m^2 + 1)}{2} = 4m^2 (8m^2 + 1)
\]

Now, we claim:
\[
4m^2 (8m^2 + 1) = [2m(2n+1)]^2
\]

But \( n(n+1) = 2m^2 \), and \( (2n+1)^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = 4n(n+1) + 1 = 8m^2 + 1 \).

Therefore,
\[
[2m(2n+1)]^2 = 4m^2 (2n+1)^2 = 4m^2 (8m^2 + 1)
\]

Exactly matches \( t_{4n(n+1)} \). So,
\[
t_{4n(n+1)} = [2m(2n+1)]^2
\]
which is a perfect square.

**Conclusion:**
If \( t_n = m^2 \) is a perfect square, then \( t_{4n(n+1)} = [2m(2n+1)]^2 \) is also a perfect square.

#### (b) Find three examples of squares that are also triangular numbers

We know \( t_1 = 1 = 1^2 \) is both triangular and square.

Using part (a), if \( t_n \) is a square, then \( t_{4n(n+1)} \) is also a square.

Start with \( n = 1 \):
- \( t_1 = 1 \) (square)
- Then \( t_{4 \cdot 1 \cdot (1+1)} = t_8 \)
\[
t_8 = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 = 6^2
\]
So, 36 is both triangular and square.

Now take \( n = 8 \):
- \( t_8 = 36 \) (square)
- Then \( t_{4 \cdot 8 \cdot (8+1)} = t_{4 \cdot 8 \cdot 9} = t_{288} \)
\[
t_{288} = \frac{288 \cdot 289}{2} = 144 \cdot 289 = (12^2) \cdot (17^2) = (12 \cdot 17)^2 = 204^2 = 41616
\]
So, 41616 is both triangular and square.

Next, take \( n = 288 \):
- \( t_{288} = 41616 \) (square)
- Then \( t_{4 \cdot 288 \cdot (288+1)} = t_{4 \cdot 288 \cdot 289} = t_{332928} \)
\[
t_{332928} = \frac{332928 \cdot 332929}{2}
\]
But we know it is a square by the proof. Actually, we can compute the square root using the formula:
From the proof, if \( t_n = m^2 \), then \( t_{4n(n+1)} = [2m(2n+1)]^2 \).

For \( n = 288 \), \( t_{288} = 41616 = 204^2 \), so \( m = 204 \).
Then \( 2n+1 = 2 \cdot 288 + 1 = 577 \)
So, \( t_{4n(n+1)} = [2 \cdot 204 \cdot 577]^2 = [408 \cdot 577]^2 \)

Compute \( 408 \cdot 577 \):
\( 400 \cdot 577 = 230800 \)
\( 8 \cdot 577 = 4616 \)
Total: \( 230800 + 4616 = 235416 \)
So, \( t_{332928} = 235416^2 \)

We can verify:
\[
t_{332928} = \frac{332928 \cdot 332929}{2} = 235416^2
\]
Indeed, it is a perfect square.

**Three examples:**
1. \( t_1 = 1 = 1^2 \)
2. \( t_8 = 36 = 6^2 \)
3. \( t_{288} = 41616 = 204^2 \)

(We also have \( t_{332928} = 235416^2 \), but three are sufficient.)

---

### Final Answer:
**(a)** If \( t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = m^2 \) is a perfect square, then \( t_{4n(n+1)} = [2m(2n+1)]^2 \) is also a perfect square.

**(b)** Three examples of triangular numbers that are also squares:
- \( t_1 = 1 = 1^2 \)
- \( t_8 = 36 = 6^2 \)
- \( t_{288} = 41616 = 204^2 \)
