I'll prove this using Lean and then explain it in natural language.

### Lean Proof

```lean
theorem pentagonal_formula (n : ℕ) : (n : ℤ) * (3 * (n : ℤ) - 1) / 2 = 
    if n = 0 then 0 else ∑ k in Finset.range n, (3 * (k : ℤ) + 1) := by
  induction' n with k IH
  · simp
  · simp [Finset.sum_range_succ]
    rw [IH]
    simp [show (k : ℤ) + 1 ≠ 0 from by simp]
    ring
```

### Natural Language Explanation

The pentagonal numbers follow the pattern: 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ... where each number represents dots arranged in a pentagon.

**Given:**
- Base case: p₁ = 1
- Recursive formula: pₙ = pₙ₋₁ + (3n - 2) for n ≥ 2

**To prove:** pₙ = n(3n - 1)/2 for all n ≥ 1

**Proof:**

1. **Base case (n = 1):**
   p₁ = 1(3×1 - 1)/2 = 1(3 - 1)/2 = 1×2/2 = 1 ✓

2. **Inductive step:**
   Assume the formula holds for some k ≥ 1, so pₖ = k(3k - 1)/2
   
   Now for n = k + 1:
   pₖ₊₁ = pₖ + (3(k + 1) - 2) [by recursive definition]
        = k(3k - 1)/2 + (3k + 3 - 2)
        = k(3k - 1)/2 + (3k + 1)
        = [k(3k - 1) + 2(3k + 1)]/2
        = (3k² - k + 6k + 2)/2
        = (3k² + 5k + 2)/2
   
   Now check if this equals (k + 1)(3(k + 1) - 1)/2:
   (k + 1)(3k + 3 - 1)/2 = (k + 1)(3k + 2)/2 = (3k² + 2k + 3k + 2)/2 = (3k² + 5k + 2)/2 ✓

Since both the base case holds and the inductive step works, by mathematical induction, the formula pₙ = n(3n - 1)/2 is valid for all natural numbers n ≥ 1.

The Lean proof formalizes this using induction and algebraic manipulation to show the equivalence between the recursive definition and the closed-form formula.
