I will prove that the expression $\frac{(3n)!}{(3!)^n}$ is an integer for all $n \geq 0$.

**Step 1: Base case (n = 0)**
$\frac{(3 \cdot 0)!}{(3!)^0} = \frac{0!}{1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1$, which is an integer.

**Step 2: Combinatorial interpretation**
This expression counts the number of ways to partition $3n$ distinct objects into $n$ groups of 3 objects each (where the order of groups doesn't matter).

We can construct such partitions as follows:
- Choose 3 objects from $3n$ for the first group: $\binom{3n}{3}$ ways
- Choose 3 objects from remaining $3n-3$ for the second group: $\binom{3n-3}{3}$ ways
- Continue this process...

The total number of such partitions is:
$\binom{3n}{3} \cdot \binom{3n-3}{3} \cdot \binom{3n-6}{3} \cdots \binom{3}{3}$

**Step 3: Show this equals our expression**
Let's expand the product:
$\frac{(3n)!}{3!(3n-3)!} \cdot \frac{(3n-3)!}{3!(3n-6)!} \cdot \frac{(3n-6)!}{3!(3n-9)!} \cdots \frac{3!}{3!0!}$

Notice the telescoping cancellation:
$= \frac{(3n)!}{(3!)^n \cdot 0!} = \frac{(3n)!}{(3!)^n}$

Since this counts a number of partitions, it must be an integer.

**Step 4: Alternative approach (induction)**
Base case: n = 0 gives 1 (integer)
Inductive step: Assume $\frac{(3k)!}{(3!)^k}$ is integer
For n = k+1:
$\frac{(3(k+1))!}{(3!)^{k+1}} = \frac{(3k+3)!}{(3!)^{k+1}} = \frac{(3k+3)(3k+2)(3k+1)(3k)!}{6 \cdot (3!)^k}$

$= \frac{(3k+3)(3k+2)(3k+1)}{6} \cdot \frac{(3k)!}{(3!)^k}$

Since $\frac{(3k)!}{(3!)^k}$ is integer by induction hypothesis, and $\frac{(3k+3)(3k+2)(3k+1)}{6}$ is the binomial coefficient $\binom{3k+3}{3}$ which is also an integer, their product is an integer.

**Conclusion:**
Therefore, $\frac{(3n)!}{(3!)^n}$ is an integer for all $n \geq 0$.

**Normal language output:**
The expression $(3n)!/(3!)^n$ represents an integer for all non-negative integers n. This can be understood combinatorially as counting the number of ways to divide 3n distinct objects into n unordered groups of 3 objects each. Since this counts a valid combinatorial arrangement, the result must be a whole number. The expression also satisfies mathematical induction, confirming it produces integer values for all n â‰¥ 0.
