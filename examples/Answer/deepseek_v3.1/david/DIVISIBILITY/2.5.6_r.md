Let's denote:
- \( c \) = number of calves
- \( l \) = number of lambs
- \( p \) = number of piglets

Given:
1. Total animals: \( c + l + p = 100 \)
2. Total cost: \( 120c + 50l + 25p = 4000 \)
3. At least one of each: \( c \geq 1 \), \( l \geq 1 \), \( p \geq 1 \)

We can simplify the cost equation by dividing by 5:
\( 24c + 10l + 5p = 800 \)

Now, express \( p \) from the total animals: \( p = 100 - c - l \)

Substitute into the cost equation:
\( 24c + 10l + 5(100 - c - l) = 800 \)
\( 24c + 10l + 500 - 5c - 5l = 800 \)
\( (24c - 5c) + (10l - 5l) + 500 = 800 \)
\( 19c + 5l + 500 = 800 \)
\( 19c + 5l = 300 \)

Now, solve for \( l \):
\( 5l = 300 - 19c \)
\( l = \frac{300 - 19c}{5} \)

Since \( l \) must be an integer, \( 300 - 19c \) must be divisible by 5. So, \( 300 - 19c \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \).
Note: \( 300 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), so \( -19c \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \). Since \( 19 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), we have \( -4c \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), which implies \( 4c \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \). Therefore, \( c \) must be a multiple of 5.

Let \( c = 5k \), where \( k \) is a positive integer (since \( c \geq 1 \)).

Then:
\( l = \frac{300 - 19(5k)}{5} = \frac{300 - 95k}{5} = 60 - 19k \)

Now, \( l \geq 1 \), so \( 60 - 19k \geq 1 \) => \( 19k \leq 59 \) => \( k \leq \frac{59}{19} \approx 3.105 \), so \( k \leq 3 \).

Also, \( p = 100 - c - l = 100 - 5k - (60 - 19k) = 100 - 5k - 60 + 19k = 40 + 14k \)

And \( p \geq 1 \), which is always true for \( k \geq 0 \).

Now, \( k \) must be a positive integer such that \( l \geq 1 \) and \( c \geq 1 \). So \( k = 1, 2, 3 \).

Check each:

1. \( k = 1 \):
   \( c = 5 \)
   \( l = 60 - 19(1) = 41 \)
   \( p = 40 + 14(1) = 54 \)
   Check cost: \( 120*5 + 50*41 + 25*54 = 600 + 2050 + 1350 = 4000 \) ✔️

2. \( k = 2 \):
   \( c = 10 \)
   \( l = 60 - 19(2) = 60 - 38 = 22 \)
   \( p = 40 + 14(2) = 40 + 28 = 68 \)
   Check cost: \( 120*10 + 50*22 + 25*68 = 1200 + 1100 + 1700 = 4000 \) ✔️

3. \( k = 3 \):
   \( c = 15 \)
   \( l = 60 - 19(3) = 60 - 57 = 3 \)
   \( p = 40 + 14(3) = 40 + 42 = 82 \)
   Check cost: \( 120*15 + 50*3 + 25*82 = 1800 + 150 + 2050 = 4000 \) ✔️

All three cases satisfy the conditions. However, the problem asks for "how many of each did he buy?" implying a unique solution. But we have three possibilities. Let's check if all are valid with "at least one of each": all have \( c \geq 1, l \geq 1, p \geq 1 \).

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the solution where all types are purchased, which all do. But maybe there is additional constraint? The problem says "obtained at least one animal of each type", which is satisfied.

But typically, such problems have a unique solution. Perhaps I missed that the number must be positive integers, which they are.

Maybe the problem has a unique answer if we assume that the farmer bought all three types, which we did.

But here we have three solutions. However, looking back at the cost: calves are expensive, so if he buys more calves, he buys fewer lambs and more piglets. All are valid.

But perhaps the problem is from a context where only one solution is expected. Let me see the prices: calves $120, lambs $50, piglets $25.

Another way: we have \( 19c + 5l = 300 \). This is a linear Diophantine equation.

We found c must be multiple of 5. So c=5,10,15.

c=20: l = (300-380)/5 = -16, not valid.

So only three solutions.

But the problem says "how many of each did he buy?" which might imply a unique answer. Perhaps I need to see if all are possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo or I missed something.

Another thought: "purchased 100 head of livestock" and "obtained at least one of each", which we have.

But let's list the solutions:
1. 5 calves, 41 lambs, 54 piglets
2. 10 calves, 22 lambs, 68 piglets
3. 15 calves, 3 lambs, 82 piglets

All are valid.

However, perhaps the problem expects the one with the most calves? Or least? But no.

Perhaps there is an additional constraint like "he bought more lambs than calves" or something, but not stated.

Wait, maybe the problem is from a puzzle where the answer is unique.

Let me check the cost again: total cost $4000.

If he buys one of each: cost 120+50+25=195, and 97 more animals. But not helpful.

Perhaps I can reduce the equations.

From \( 19c + 5l = 300 \), and c,l >=1.

The general solution: c=5,10,15 as above.

So there are three possible purchases.

But perhaps the problem has a mistake, or I need to output all.

However, looking online, I recall a similar problem: "A farmer bought 100 animals for $100, etc." but here it's $4000.

Wait, let me see the numbers: 120,50,25 and 4000.

Notice that 4000/100=40, average price $40.

Calves are above average, lambs and piglets below.

So he must have more piglets and lambs.

In our solutions, indeed.

But still three.

Perhaps the problem is to find the number, and it has multiple answers.

But the way it is phrased: "how many of each did he buy?" suggests unique.

Another idea: perhaps "obtained at least one animal of each type" and also perhaps he bought them in such a way that the number is determined.

Wait, let's see the difference between the solutions.

Perhaps there is an additional constraint like "he bought more than one of each", but not stated.

Or "he bought at least one of each", which is satisfied.

Perhaps the problem is from a source where only one solution is valid due to context.

But in this case, all are valid.

However, let's check the number of lambs: in solution 3, only 3 lambs, which is at least one.

So all good.

Perhaps the answer is expected to be the one with the most calves or something.

But I think for the purpose of this, since the problem asks "how many of each", and there are three, but perhaps I can choose one.

Wait, let's see the lean statement.

The user said "write output as normal language".

So perhaps we can state that there are three possibilities.

But typically, such problems have a unique solution.

Let me double-check the cost for c=5: 5*120=600, then 41*50=2050, 54*25=1350, total 600+2050=2650+1350=4000.

Similarly others.

So indeed three.

Perhaps the problem has a typo in the prices.

Another thought: perhaps "calves, $120 each" etc., and total $4000.

Maybe the farmer obtained exactly one of each type? But it says "at least one".

So not.

Perhaps I can assume that he bought more than one of each, which all do.

So I think there are three solutions.

But to answer, since the problem asks "how many of each", perhaps it's the one with the middle number.

But let's see the lean code.

Perhaps for lean, we need to state the answer.

Since the user said "confirm result", and "write output as normal language", I'll provide one.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that l must be integer, and we have.

Another idea: from \( l = 60 - 19k \), and l>=1, so k<=3, and also c>=1, so k>=1.

So k=1,2,3.

So three.

Perhaps the problem is to find all, but the output should be the one with the most animals of one type.

But I think for the sake of this, I'll take k=2: 10 calves, 22 lambs, 68 piglets.

Or perhaps the problem has a unique solution if we consider that he bought at least one of each, and the number is unique.

But it's not.

Let's try to see if there is another constraint.

Perhaps "head of livestock" implies that they are all of the same type? But no, it says three types.

I think I have to accept that there are three answers.

But for the response, I'll provide one.

Perhaps the intended answer is 5 calves, 41 lambs, 54 piglets.

Or 10,22,68.

But let's see the lean code.

Since the user said "write lean statement", perhaps we can write a lean proof that there are three solutions.

But for output, I'll say there are three possibilities.

So in normal language:

The farmer could have bought:
- 5 calves, 41 lambs, and 54 piglets, or
- 10 calves, 22 lambs, and 68 piglets, or
- 15 calves, 3 lambs, and 82 piglets.

All satisfy the conditions.

So the answer is not unique.

Therefore, the farmer could have purchased any one of these combinations.

So for the lean statement, we can state the existence.

But since the user asked "how many of each", perhaps it's to list them.

So I'll go with that.

Final answer: There are three possible combinations:
1. 5 calves, 41 lambs, 54 piglets
2. 10 calves, 22 lambs, 68 piglets
3. 15 calves, 3 lambs, 82 piglets

All satisfy the conditions of purchasing 100 animals for $4000 with at least one of each type.

\boxed{(5,41,54)} \quad \boxed{(10,22,68)} \quad \boxed{(15,3,82)}
