Of course. Here is the proof written in a structured, Lean-like style, followed by a plain English explanation.

### Lean-like Proof

  -- Prove -a ∣ -b by showing -b = (-a) * k

    use k
    calc
      -b = -(a * k) := by rw [hk]
        _ = (-a) * k := by ring

  -- Combine the three proofs into the required conjunction
  exact ⟨h1, h2, h3⟩
```

### Plain Language Explanation

The statement "a | b" means there exists some integer `k` such that `b = a * k`.

1.  **Proving (-a) | b:**
    We need to find an integer `m` such that `b = (-a) * m`.
    Starting from `b = a * k`, we can write:
    `b = a * k = -(-(a * k)) = - (a * (-(-k))) = (-a) * (-k)`.
    Letting `m = -k`, which is an integer, we have `b = (-a) * m`. Therefore, `(-a)` divides `b`.

2.  **Proving a | (-b):**
    We need to find an integer `n` such that `-b = a * n`.
    Starting from `b = a * k`, we can multiply both sides by `-1`:
    `-b = -(a * k) = a * (-k)`.
    Letting `n = -k`, which is an integer, we have `-b = a * n`. Therefore, `a` divides `-b`.

3.  **Proving (-a) | (-b):**
    We need to find an integer `p` such that `-b = (-a) * p`.
    Starting from `b = a * k`, we can multiply both sides by `-1`:
    `-b = -(a * k) = (-a) * k`.
    Letting `p = k`, which is an integer, we have `-b = (-a) * p`. Therefore, `(-a)` divides `-b`.

In all three cases, the existence of the original multiplier `k` (from `a | b`) allows us to directly construct the new multiplier needed for the new divisibility relationship, confirming that all three statements are true.
