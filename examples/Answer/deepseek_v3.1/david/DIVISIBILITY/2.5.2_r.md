Let's solve each Diophantine equation step by step. We are looking for integer solutions \( (x, y) \).

### (a) \(56x + 72y = 40\)

First, simplify by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 56, 72, and 40.

- gcd(56, 72) = 8, and 40 is divisible by 8? Yes, 40/8=5.
So divide the entire equation by 8:
\(7x + 9y = 5\).

Now, solve \(7x + 9y = 5\).

Find a particular solution. Notice that \(7(-1) + 9(1) = -7 + 9 = 2\), not 5.
We need to scale: if \(7(-1) + 9(1) = 2\), then for 5, multiply by \(k\) such that \(2k=5\)? Not integer.
Alternatively, find integers such that \(7x + 9y = 5\).

Try \(x = 2\): \(14 + 9y = 5 \Rightarrow 9y = -9 \Rightarrow y = -1\). So particular solution: \(x_0 = 2, y_0 = -1\).

The general solution is:
\(x = x_0 + \frac{b}{d}t = 2 + 9t\)
\(y = y_0 - \frac{a}{d}t = -1 - 7t\)
where \(d = \gcd(7,9)=1\).

So all integer solutions:
\[
x = 2 + 9t, \quad y = -1 - 7t, \quad t \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]

### (b) \(24x + 138y = 18\)

Simplify by dividing by gcd(24,138,18).

First, gcd(24,138):
24 factors: 2^3 * 3
138 factors: 2 * 3 * 23
gcd = 2 * 3 = 6.
18 is divisible by 6? Yes, 18/6=3.
Divide entire equation by 6:
\(4x + 23y = 3\).

Now solve \(4x + 23y = 3\).

Find a particular solution. Notice that \(4(6) + 23(-1) = 24 - 23 = 1\).
To get 3, multiply by 3: \(4(18) + 23(-3) = 72 - 69 = 3\).
So \(x_0 = 18, y_0 = -3\).

General solution:
\(x = x_0 + \frac{b}{d}t = 18 + 23t\)
\(y = y_0 - \frac{a}{d}t = -3 - 4t\)
where \(d = \gcd(4,23)=1\).

So all integer solutions:
\[
x = 18 + 23t, \quad y = -3 - 4t, \quad t \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]

### (c) \(221x + 35y = 11\)

First, check gcd(221,35):
221 factors: 13*17
35 factors: 5*7
gcd=1, so solutions exist.

Solve \(221x + 35y = 11\).

Use Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a particular solution.

Compute gcd(221,35):
221 = 6*35 + 11
35 = 3*11 + 2
11 = 5*2 + 1
2 = 2*1 + 0, so gcd=1.

Back substitution:
1 = 11 - 5*2
But 2 = 35 - 3*11, so:
1 = 11 - 5*(35 - 3*11) = 11 - 5*35 + 15*11 = 16*11 - 5*35
Now 11 = 221 - 6*35, so:
1 = 16*(221 - 6*35) - 5*35 = 16*221 - 96*35 - 5*35 = 16*221 - 101*35.
So \(221(16) + 35(-101) = 1\).

To get 11, multiply by 11:
\(221(176) + 35(-1111) = 11\).

So particular solution: \(x_0 = 176, y_0 = -1111\).

General solution:
\(x = x_0 + \frac{b}{d}t = 176 + 35t\)
\(y = y_0 - \frac{a}{d}t = -1111 - 221t\)
where \(d=1\).

So all integer solutions:
\[
x = 176 + 35t, \quad y = -1111 - 221t, \quad t \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]

### Summary of Solutions:

(a) \(x = 2 + 9t\), \(y = -1 - 7t\), \(t \in \mathbb{Z}\).

(b) \(x = 18 + 23t\), \(y = -3 - 4t\), \(t \in \mathbb{Z}\).

(c) \(x = 176 + 35t\), \(y = -1111 - 221t\), \(t \in \mathbb{Z}\).

### Lean Statement:

In Lean, we can state these solutions as:

```lean
-- For (a)
example : ∀ (x y : ℤ), 56*x + 72*y = 40 ↔ ∃ (t : ℤ), x = 2 + 9*t ∧ y = -1 - 7*t := by
  intro x y
  constructor
  · intro h
    have h1 : 7*x + 9*y = 5 := by
      have : 56*x + 72*y = 40 := h
      linarith [show (56*x + 72*y) / 8 = 40 / 8 by ring] -- Actually, better to use divisibility
    -- Alternatively, use the general solution method
    sorry -- Detailed proof would involve Euclidean algorithm and parametrization
  · rintro ⟨t, rfl, rfl⟩
    ring

-- Similarly for (b) and (c)
```

But since the detailed proof in Lean might be lengthy, we typically use the existence of the general solution form.

### Output in Normal Language:

The integer solutions for each equation are:

(a) \(x = 2 + 9k\), \(y = -1 - 7k\) for any integer \(k\).

(b) \(x = 18 + 23k\), \(y = -3 - 4k\) for any integer \(k\).

(c) \(x = 176 + 35k\), \(y = -1111 - 221k\) for any integer \(k\).

These represent all integer solutions to the respective equations.
