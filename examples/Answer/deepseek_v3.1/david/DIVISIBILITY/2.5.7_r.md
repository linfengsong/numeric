Let's denote:
- Let \( d \) be the number of dollars originally.
- Let \( c \) be the number of cents originally.

So, the original amount is \( 100d + c \) cents.

The teller gave:
- Number of cents as dollars: so \( c \) dollars.
- Number of dollars as cents: so \( d \) cents.

Thus, the amount given by the teller is \( 100c + d \) cents.

Mr. Smith spent 68 cents, so he has \( (100c + d) - 68 \) cents left.

This remaining amount is twice the original check:
\[
(100c + d) - 68 = 2(100d + c)
\]

Simplify:
\[
100c + d - 68 = 200d + 2c
\]
\[
100c + d - 68 - 200d - 2c = 0
\]
\[
98c - 199d - 68 = 0
\]
\[
98c - 199d = 68
\]

We need to find non-negative integers \( d \) and \( c \) with \( 0 \leq c \leq 99 \) (since cents are from 0 to 99) and \( d \geq 0 \).

So, solve:
\[
98c - 199d = 68
\]

This is a linear Diophantine equation. We can solve for \( c \) in terms of \( d \):
\[
98c = 199d + 68
\]
\[
c = \frac{199d + 68}{98}
\]

Since \( c \) must be an integer, \( 199d + 68 \) must be divisible by 98.

Let’s reduce modulo 98:

Note:
\( 199 \mod 98 \):
\( 98 \times 2 = 196 \), so \( 199 - 196 = 3 \), so \( 199 \equiv 3 \pmod{98} \).
\( 68 \mod 98 \) is 68.

So:
\[
199d + 68 \equiv 3d + 68 \pmod{98}
\]
We need \( 3d + 68 \equiv 0 \pmod{98} \), i.e.,
\[
3d \equiv -68 \pmod{98}
\]
\( -68 \mod 98 \) is \( 98 - 68 = 30 \) (since -68 + 98 = 30), so:
\[
3d \equiv 30 \pmod{98}
\]
Divide both sides by gcd(3,98)=1 (so we can divide):
\[
d \equiv 10 \pmod{98}
\]
So \( d = 10 + 98k \) for some integer \( k \geq 0 \).

Now substitute back:
\[
c = \frac{199(10 + 98k) + 68}{98} = \frac{1990 + 199 \cdot 98k + 68}{98} = \frac{2058 + 199 \cdot 98k}{98}
\]
Simplify:
\( 199 \cdot 98k / 98 = 199k \), and \( 2058 / 98 = 21 \) (since \( 98 \times 21 = 2058 \)), so:
\[
c = 21 + 199k
\]

But \( c \) must be between 0 and 99. So:
\[
0 \leq 21 + 199k \leq 99
\]
For \( k=0 \): \( c=21 \), which is between 0 and 99.
For \( k=1 \): \( c=21+199=220 \), which is >99, not allowed.

So only \( k=0 \) is valid.

Thus:
\( d = 10 + 98 \cdot 0 = 10 \)
\( c = 21 \)

Original check: \( 10 \) dollars and \( 21 \) cents, i.e., $10.21.

Verify:
Teller gave: number of cents as dollars: 21 dollars, and number of dollars as cents: 10 cents, so $21.10 (which is 2110 cents).
Spent 68 cents: left with \( 2110 - 68 = 2042 \) cents.
Twice original: original is \( 100*10 + 21 = 1021 \) cents, twice is 2042 cents. Matches.

Thus the smallest value is $10.21.

**Lean Statement:**
```lean

  refine ⟨10, 21, rfl, rfl, by simp, by simp, by norm_num⟩
```

**Output in Normal Language:**
The smallest value for which the check could have been written is $10.21. This means the original check was for 10 dollars and 21 cents. The teller mistakenly gave 21 dollars and 10 cents (i.e., $21.10). After spending 68 cents, Mr. Smith had $20.42 left, which is exactly twice the original amount of $10.21.
