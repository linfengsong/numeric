Here is a Lean 4 statement of the Division Algorithm with the specified remainder condition, followed by an explanation in normal language:

```lean
theorem division_algorithm_symmetric (a b : ℤ) (hb : b ≠ 0) :
    ∃! (q r : ℤ), a = q * b + r ∧ -(|b|/2) < r ∧ r ≤ |b|/2 := by
  -- Proof would go here, typically using:
  -- 1. The standard division algorithm to get q₀ and r₀ with 0 ≤ r₀ < |b|
  -- 2. Adjusting q and r based on whether r₀ ≤ |b|/2 or r₀ > |b|/2
  -- 3. Proving uniqueness by showing any two solutions must be equal
  sorry
```

**Note:** The exact formulation above uses `|b|/2` which works for integers since Lean 4's integer division rounds toward zero. For a more precise version that uses the condition `-((|b| - 1)/2) ≤ r ≤ |b|/2` (which gives the symmetric remainder range), the statement would need adjustment.

**Normal language explanation:**

The Division Algorithm with symmetric remainder states that for any integers a and b where b ≠ 0, there exist unique integers q (quotient) and r (remainder) such that:

a = q × b + r

with the remainder r satisfying: -|b|/2 < r ≤ |b|/2

This means the remainder r falls in the symmetric interval centered around zero. For example:
- If b = 5, then r ∈ {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} (since -2.5 < r ≤ 2.5)
- If b = 6, then r ∈ {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3} (since -3 < r ≤ 3)

This version minimizes the absolute value of the remainder and is particularly useful in number theory and computer algebra systems where symmetric remainders are often preferred.

The uniqueness ensures that for each pair (a,b), there is exactly one pair (q,r) satisfying these conditions.
