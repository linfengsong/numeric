I will prove these properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd) for a nonzero integer \(a\).

**Proof:**

1. **gcd(a, 0) = |a|**
   - The divisors of 0 are all integers (except 0 cannot be divided by 0)
   - The divisors of \(a\) are the integers that divide \(a\)
   - The common divisors are exactly the divisors of \(|a|\) (since sign doesn't matter for divisibility)
   - The largest common divisor is therefore \(|a|\)
   - Thus, gcd(a, 0) = |a|

2. **gcd(a, a) = |a|**
   - The divisors of \(a\) are the integers that divide \(a\)
   - The common divisors of \(a\) and \(a\) are exactly the divisors of \(|a|\)
   - The largest common divisor is \(|a|\)
   - Thus, gcd(a, a) = |a|

3. **gcd(a, 1) = 1**
   - The divisors of 1 are only ±1
   - The common divisors of \(a\) and 1 are therefore only ±1
   - The largest common divisor is 1
   - Thus, gcd(a, 1) = 1

**In normal language:**
For any nonzero integer a:
- The greatest common divisor of a and 0 is the absolute value of a
- The greatest common divisor of a and itself is the absolute value of a  
- The greatest common divisor of a and 1 is always 1

These results follow directly from the definition of the greatest common divisor and the divisibility properties of integers.
