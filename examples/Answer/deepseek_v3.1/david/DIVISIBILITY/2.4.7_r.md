### Proof Sketch

We aim to show the equivalence of the following statements for nonzero integers \(a\) and \(b\):
1. \(a \mid b\)
2. \(\gcd(a, b) = |a|\)
3. \(\operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = |b|\)

**Step 1: Show (a) ⇒ (b)**
- Assume \(a \mid b\). Then \(b = ka\) for some integer \(k\).
- The gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) is \(|a|\) because \(a\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), and any common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) must divide \(a\).

**Step 2: Show (b) ⇒ (c)**
- Assume \(\gcd(a, b) = |a|\). Use the identity \(\gcd(a, b) \cdot \operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = |ab|\).
- Substitute to get \(|a| \cdot \operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = |ab|\), so \(\operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = |b|\).

**Step 3: Show (c) ⇒ (a)**
- Assume \(\operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = |b|\). By definition, \(a \mid \operatorname{lcm}(a, b)\), so \(a \mid |b|\).
- Since \(b \neq 0\), \(|b|\) is a positive multiple of \(a\), hence \(a \mid b\).

**Conclusion**: The three conditions are equivalent.

### Output in Natural Language:
For nonzero integers \(a\) and \(b\), the conditions (a) \(a\) divides \(b\), (b) the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) is \(|a|\), and (c) the least common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\) is \(|b|\) are all equivalent. This means that if any one of these conditions holds, the other two must also hold. The proof uses fundamental properties of gcd and lcm, including the relationship \(\gcd(a, b) \cdot \operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = |ab|\).
