I'll prove these properties of the least common multiple (lcm) for nonzero integers.

### (a) gcd(a, b) = lcm(a, b) if and only if a = ±b

**Proof:**
Let d = gcd(a, b) and L = lcm(a, b).

(⇒) If gcd(a, b) = lcm(a, b), then d = L.
Since d divides both a and b, and L is a multiple of both a and b, we have:
d | a and a | L = d, so a | d
d | b and b | L = d, so b | d

Thus d divides both a and b, and both a and b divide d. This means d = ±a and d = ±b, so a = ±b.

(⇐) If a = ±b, then gcd(a, b) = |a| and lcm(a, b) = |a|, so gcd(a, b) = lcm(a, b).

### (b) If k > 0, then lcm(ka, kb) = k lcm(a, b)

**Proof:**
Let L = lcm(a, b). Then:
1. kL is a multiple of ka (since a | L ⇒ ka | kL)
2. kL is a multiple of kb (since b | L ⇒ kb | kL)

Now suppose m is any common multiple of ka and kb. Then m/k is a common multiple of a and b (since ka | m ⇒ a | m/k, and kb | m ⇒ b | m/k). Since L is the least common multiple of a and b, we have L | m/k, so kL | m.

Thus kL is the least common multiple of ka and kb.

### (c) If m is any common multiple of a and b, then lcm(a, b) | m

**Proof:**
Let L = lcm(a, b). Consider the division algorithm: m = qL + r where 0 ≤ r < L.

Since a | m and a | L, we have a | r.
Since b | m and b | L, we have b | r.

Thus r is a common multiple of a and b that is less than L. Since L is the least positive common multiple, we must have r = 0. Therefore L | m.

### Normal Language Output

The three properties of least common multiples for nonzero integers are:

1. **gcd equals lcm if and only if numbers are equal up to sign**: The greatest common divisor equals the least common multiple exactly when the two numbers are either equal or negatives of each other.

2. **Scaling property**: Multiplying both numbers by a positive constant k scales their lcm by the same factor k.

3. **Divisibility property**: The lcm divides every common multiple of the two numbers, making it the "least" common multiple in the divisibility sense.

These properties show that the lcm is well-behaved under scaling and serves as the minimal common multiple that divides all other common multiples.
