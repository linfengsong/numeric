Let's address each part step by step:

### (a) Two triangular numbers whose sum and difference are also triangular numbers.

Triangular numbers are given by \( T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

We need \( T_a \) and \( T_b \) (with \( a > b \)) such that:
- \( T_a + T_b = T_c \)
- \( T_a - T_b = T_d \)

Let \( T_a = \frac{a(a+1)}{2} \), \( T_b = \frac{b(b+1)}{2} \).

Then:
1. \( T_a + T_b = \frac{a(a+1) + b(b+1)}{2} = \frac{c(c+1)}{2} \)
   => \( a(a+1) + b(b+1) = c(c+1) \)
2. \( T_a - T_b = \frac{a(a+1) - b(b+1)}{2} = \frac{d(d+1)}{2} \)
   => \( a(a+1) - b(b+1) = d(d+1) \)

We can look for small pairs by testing.

Known pair: \( T_6 = 21 \), \( T_5 = 15 \)
Sum = 21 + 15 = 36 = \( T_8 \) (since 36 is triangular, \( T_8 = 36 \))
Difference = 21 - 15 = 6 = \( T_3 \) (since 6 is triangular, \( T_3 = 6 \))

So \( (a, b) = (6, 5) \) works.

Thus, the two triangular numbers are \( T_6 = 21 \) and \( T_5 = 15 \).

**Answer (a):**  
The triangular numbers are 21 and 15. Their sum is 36 (which is \( T_8 \)) and difference is 6 (which is \( T_3 \)).

### (b) Three successive triangular numbers whose product is a perfect square.

Let the three successive triangular numbers be:
\( T_{n-1} = \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \), \( T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), \( T_{n+1} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \).

Product:
\[
P = T_{n-1} \cdot T_n \cdot T_{n+1} = \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \cdot \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} = \frac{(n-1) \cdot n^2 \cdot (n+1)^2 \cdot (n+2)}{8}
\]

We need \( P \) to be a perfect square.

Let’s test small values of \( n \):

- \( n=1 \): \( T_0=0, T_1=1, T_2=3 \), product=0 (not positive, skip)
- \( n=2 \): \( T_1=1, T_2=3, T_3=6 \), product=18 (not square)
- \( n=3 \): \( T_2=3, T_3=6, T_4=10 \), product=180 (not square)
- \( n=4 \): \( T_3=6, T_4=10, T_5=15 \), product=900 (which is \( 30^2 \))

So \( n=4 \) works: \( T_3=6 \), \( T_4=10 \), \( T_5=15 \), product=900 = \( 30^2 \).

**Answer (b):**  
The three successive triangular numbers are 6, 10, and 15. Their product is 900, which is a perfect square (30²).

---

### (c) Three successive triangular numbers whose sum is a perfect square.

Let the three successive triangular numbers be:
\( T_{n-1} = \frac{(n-1)n}{2} \), \( T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), \( T_{n+1} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \).

Sum:
\[
S = T_{n-1} + T_n + T_{n+1} = \frac{(n-1)n}{2} + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left[ (n-1)n + n(n+1) + (n+1)(n+2) \right]
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left[ n^2 - n + n^2 + n + n^2 + 3n + 2 \right]
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left[ 3n^2 + 3n + 2 \right]
\]

We need \( S = k^2 \) for some integer \( k \).

So:
\[
\frac{3n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} = k^2 \implies 3n^2 + 3n + 2 = 2k^2
\]

This is a Diophantine equation. Let's test small \( n \):

- \( n=1 \): \( T_0=0, T_1=1, T_2=3 \), sum=4 = \( 2^2 \) (perfect square!)
But \( T_0=0 \) is often included, but sometimes triangular numbers start from \( T_1 \). However, \( T_0=0 \) is defined.

So \( n=1 \): \( T_0=0 \), \( T_1=1 \), \( T_2=3 \) sum=4=2².

Check \( n=2 \): \( T_1=1, T_2=3, T_3=6 \), sum=10 (not square)
\( n=3 \): \( T_2=3, T_3=6, T_4=10 \), sum=19 (not square)
\( n=4 \): \( T_3=6, T_4=10, T_5=15 \), sum=31 (not square)
\( n=5 \): \( T_4=10, T_5=15, T_6=21 \), sum=46 (not square)
\( n=6 \): \( T_5=15, T_6=21, T_7=28 \), sum=64=8² (perfect square!)

So \( n=6 \) gives \( T_5=15 \), \( T_6=21 \), \( T_7=28 \), sum=64=8².

Also \( n=1 \) gives \( T_0=0 \), \( T_1=1 \), \( T_2=3 \), sum=4=2².

So we have two examples.

**Answer (c):**  
Three successive triangular numbers whose sum is a perfect square are:
- \( T_0=0 \), \( T_1=1 \), \( T_2=3 \) (sum=4=2²)
- \( T_5=15 \), \( T_6=21 \), \( T_7=28 \) (sum=64=8²)

---

### Final Answers:

(a) The triangular numbers are 15 (\(T_5\)) and 21 (\(T_6\)). Their sum is 36 (\(T_8\)) and difference is 6 (\(T_3\)).

(b) The three successive triangular numbers are 6 (\(T_3\)), 10 (\(T_4\)), and 15 (\(T_5\)). Their product is 900, which is \(30^2\).

(c) Two sets:
   - \(T_0=0\), \(T_1=1\), \(T_2=3\) with sum 4 = \(2^2\)
   - \(T_5=15\), \(T_6=21\), \(T_7=28\) with sum 64 = \(8^2\)

(Note: \(T_0=0\) is a triangular number, but if you prefer positive ones, use the second set.)
