Let's analyze the statement step by step.

**Given:**  
Any integer of the form \(6k + 5\) (where \(k\) is an integer) is also of the form \(3j + 2\), but not conversely.

---

### 1. Show that \(6k + 5\) is of the form \(3j + 2\):
Let \(n = 6k + 5\).  
We can rewrite \(n\) as:
\[
n = 6k + 5 = 3(2k) + 5 = 3(2k) + 3 + 2 = 3(2k + 1) + 2.
\]
Let \(j = 2k + 1\), which is an integer (since \(k\) is an integer). Then:
\[
n = 3j + 2.
\]
So, indeed, every integer of the form \(6k + 5\) is also of the form \(3j + 2\).

---

### 2. Show that the converse is not true:
That is, not every integer of the form \(3j + 2\) is of the form \(6k + 5\).

Consider an integer of the form \(3j + 2\).  
We want to see if it can always be written as \(6k + 5\).

Let \(m = 3j + 2\).  
We need to check if \(m \equiv 5 \pmod{6}\).

But note: \(3j + 2 \mod 6\) can take different values depending on \(j \mod 2\):
- If \(j\) is even, say \(j = 2t\), then \(m = 3(2t) + 2 = 6t + 2 \equiv 2 \pmod{6}\).
- If \(j\) is odd, say \(j = 2t + 1\), then \(m = 3(2t + 1) + 2 = 6t + 3 + 2 = 6t + 5 \equiv 5 \pmod{6}\).

So, integers of the form \(3j + 2\) are congruent to either \(2 \pmod{6}\) or \(5 \pmod{6}\). Specifically:
- When \(j\) is even, \(m = 6t + 2\) (which is not of the form \(6k + 5\)).
- When \(j\) is odd, \(m = 6t + 5\) (which is of the form \(6k + 5\)).

Therefore, not every integer of the form \(3j + 2\) is of the form \(6k + 5\). For example, take \(j = 0\): \(m = 3(0) + 2 = 2\). But \(2\) cannot be written as \(6k + 5\) for any integer \(k\), because \(6k + 5 \geq 5\) for \(k \geq 0\) and \(6k + 5 \leq -1\) for \(k \leq -1\). So \(2\) is not of the form \(6k + 5\).

### 3. Lean Statement:
In Lean, we can state and prove this as follows:

```lean
theorem form_equiv : (∀ k : ℤ, ∃ j : ℤ, 6*k + 5 = 3*j + 2) ∧ 
                     ¬(∀ j : ℤ, ∃ k : ℤ, 3*j + 2 = 6*k + 5) := by
  constructor
  · intro k
    use 2*k + 1
    ring
  · intro h
    have h1 := h 0
    rcases h1 with ⟨k, hk⟩
    linarith [hk]  -- This will show a contradiction since 3*0+2=2 ≠ 6*k+5 for any integer k.
```

**Explanation of the Lean code:**
- The first part shows that for every integer \(k\), there exists an integer \(j\) (specifically \(j = 2k + 1\)) such that \(6k + 5 = 3j + 2\).
- The second part assumes the converse (that for every \(j\) there exists \(k\) such that \(3j + 2 = 6k + 5\)) and derives a contradiction for \(j = 0\): \(3*0 + 2 = 2\) must equal \(6k + 5\), but \(6k + 5 = 2\) implies \(6k = -3\), so \(k = -1/2\), which is not an integer. Hence, the converse fails.

---

### 4. Output in Normal Language:
We have shown:
- Every integer of the form \(6k + 5\) can be expressed as \(3j + 2\) by taking \(j = 2k + 1\).
- However, not every integer of the form \(3j + 2\) is of the form \(6k + 5\). For example, when \(j = 0\), we get \(2\), which cannot be written as \(6k + 5\) for any integer \(k\).

Thus, the statement is proven: any integer of the form \(6k + 5\) is also of the form \(3j + 2\), but the converse does not hold.
