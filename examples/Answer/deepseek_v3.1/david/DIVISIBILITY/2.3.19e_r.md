### Step 1: Factor the Expression

We want to show that \(360 \mid a^2(a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4)\).

First, observe that:
\[
a^2(a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4) = a^2 (a-1)(a+1)(a-2)(a+2).
\]

### Step 2: Factorize 360

\[
360 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5.
\]
So we need to show that \(a^2(a-1)(a+1)(a-2)(a+2)\) is divisible by \(8\), \(9\), and \(5\).

---

### Step 3: Prove Divisibility by 5

Consider the integer \(a\) modulo 5. The possible residues are \(0, 1, 2, 3, 4\).

- If \(a \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\), then \(a^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\).
- If \(a \equiv 1 \pmod{5}\), then \(a-1 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\).
- If \(a \equiv 2 \pmod{5}\), then \(a-2 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\).
- If \(a \equiv 3 \pmod{5}\), then \(a+2 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\) (since \(3+2=5\)).
- If \(a \equiv 4 \pmod{5}\), then \(a+1 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\) (since \(4+1=5\)).

In every case, one of the factors is divisible by 5. Hence, the product is divisible by 5.

---

### Step 4: Prove Divisibility by 9

We need to show that the product is divisible by \(3^2 = 9\).

Consider \(a\) modulo 3. The residues are \(0, 1, 2\).

- If \(a \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\), then \(a^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\), so \(a^2\) is divisible by 9 if \(a\) is divisible by 3 (but we only need one factor of 3 from \(a^2\), and another from somewhere else? Actually, we need two factors of 3).

Better: Look at the three consecutive integers among \(a-2, a-1, a, a+1, a+2\). In any set of three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3. But we have five consecutive integers? Actually, \(a-2, a-1, a, a+1, a+2\) are five consecutive integers. Among any three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3. Here we have five, so at least one is divisible by 3, but we need two.

Actually, since the numbers are symmetric, we can check:

- If \(a \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\), then \(a\) is divisible by 3, and also \(a^2\) is divisible by 9.
- If \(a \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\), then \(a-1 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\) and \(a+2 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\) (since \(1+2=3\)), so both are divisible by 3.
- If \(a \equiv 2 \pmod{3}\), then \(a+1 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\) and \(a-2 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\) (since \(2-2=0\)), so both are divisible by 3.

In all cases, we have at least two factors of 3. Hence, the product is divisible by 9.

---

### Step 5: Prove Divisibility by 8

We need to show that the product is divisible by \(2^3 = 8\).

Consider the parity of \(a\):

#### Case 1: \(a\) is even
Let \(a = 2k\).
Then \(a^2 = 4k^2\), which is divisible by 4.
Also, among \(a-2, a-1, a+1, a+2\), we have two even numbers (since \(a\) is even, \(a-2\) and \(a+2\) are even). So we have at least three factors of 2: one from \(a^2\) (which gives at least 2) and one from another even number. So divisible by 8.

More formally:
- \(a^2\) contributes at least \(2^2\).
- \(a-2\) and \(a+2\) are even, so one of them contributes at least another 2 (since they are multiples of 2 but not necessarily 4). But actually, since \(a\) is even, \(a-2\) and \(a+2\) are also even. So we have three even numbers: \(a\), \(a-2\), \(a+2\). So the product has at least \(2^3\).

#### Case 2: \(a\) is odd
Let \(a = 2k+1\).
Then \(a-1\) and \(a+1\) are even. So we have two even numbers. Also, \(a^2\) is odd, but \((a-1)(a+1) = (2k)(2k+2) = 4k(k+1)\), and \(k(k+1)\) is even (since consecutive integers), so \(4k(k+1)\) is divisible by 8.
Hence, the product is divisible by 8.

---

### Step 6: Conclusion

Since \(a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)\) is divisible by 8, 9, and 5, and these are coprime, it is divisible by \(8 \cdot 9 \cdot 5 = 360\).

Therefore,
\[
360 \mid a^2(a^2 - 1)(a^2 - 4).
\]

### Output in Normal Language

We have shown that for any integer \(a\), the expression \(a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)\) is always divisible by 360. This is because:

- It is divisible by 5 (as one of the numbers \(a, a-1, a-2, a+1, a+2\) is a multiple of 5).
- It is divisible by 9 (as either \(a\) is a multiple of 3 (making \(a^2\) divisible by 9) or two of the other factors are multiples of 3).
- It is divisible by 8 (by considering whether \(a\) is even or odd; in both cases, the product contains at least three factors of 2).

Since 360 = 8 × 9 × 5 and these numbers are coprime, the divisibility by each implies divisibility by their product. Hence, \(360 \mid a^2(a^2-1)(a^2-4)\).
