Let's analyze the statement:

**We are given:** Integers \( a \) and \( b \) with \( b \neq 0 \).
**We need to prove:** There exist unique integers \( q \) and \( r \) such that:
\[
a = qb + r \quad \text{with} \quad 2b \leq r < 3b.
\]

Wait: Note the condition \( 2b \leq r < 3b \). This is unusual because typically the division algorithm gives \( 0 \leq r < |b| \). Here the remainder is constrained to lie in an interval of length \( |b| \), but shifted by \( 2b \).

Let's rewrite the condition without absolute values for clarity. Since \( b \) can be positive or negative, we should consider cases.

But observe: The condition \( 2b \leq r < 3b \) is written without absolute values. This implies that the meaning depends on the sign of \( b \).

Case 1: \( b > 0 \).
Then \( 2b \leq r < 3b \) is a well-defined interval of length \( b \).

Case 2: \( b < 0 \).
Then \( 2b \leq r < 3b \). Since \( b \) is negative, \( 2b \) is more negative than \( 3b \). For example, if \( b = -5 \), then \( 2b = -10 \), \( 3b = -15 \), and the inequality becomes \( -10 \leq r < -15 \), which is impossible because \( -10 \) is greater than \( -15 \). So we must interpret the inequalities correctly when \( b < 0 \).

Actually, the statement says \( 2b \leq r < 3b \). If \( b < 0 \), then \( 3b < 2b \) (since multiplying by a negative number reverses inequalities). So for \( b < 0 \), the condition should be understood as \( 3b < r \leq 2b \) (to have a non-empty interval). But the statement as written is \( 2b \leq r < 3b \), which for negative \( b \) gives an empty set. Therefore, it seems the statement is intended for \( b > 0 \).

Perhaps the problem assumes \( b > 0 \). Let's check: "with b ≠ 0". It doesn't say positive, but the condition \( 2b \leq r < 3b \) only makes sense if \( b > 0 \). Otherwise, if \( b < 0 \), we would need to have \( 3b \leq r < 2b \) (which is an interval of length \( |b| \)). So to avoid confusion, we assume \( b > 0 \).

**Assume \( b > 0 \).**

We want to show existence and uniqueness of integers \( q \) and \( r \) such that:
\[
a = qb + r, \quad \text{with} \quad 2b \leq r < 3b.
\]

Note that this is similar to the division algorithm, but with a different range for the remainder.

Let's relate this to the standard division algorithm. By the division algorithm, there exist unique integers \( q' \) and \( r' \) such that:
\[
a = q' b + r', \quad \text{with} \quad 0 \leq r' < b.
\]
But we want \( r \) in \( [2b, 3b) \). Notice that if we let \( q = q' - 2 \), then:
\[
a = (q' - 2)b + (r' + 2b) = qb + r, \quad \text{where} \quad r = r' + 2b.
\]
Now, since \( 0 \leq r' < b \), we have \( 2b \leq r' + 2b < 3b \), i.e., \( 2b \leq r < 3b \).

So, define:
\[
q = q' - 2, \quad r = r' + 2b.
\]
Then \( a = qb + r \) with \( 2b \leq r < 3b \).

This gives existence.

For uniqueness: Suppose we have two representations:
\[
a = q_1 b + r_1 = q_2 b + r_2, \quad \text{with} \quad 2b \leq r_1, r_2 < 3b.
\]
Then \( (q_1 - q_2)b = r_2 - r_1 \).
Since \( r_1, r_2 \in [2b, 3b) \), the difference \( r_2 - r_1 \) is in \( (-b, b) \). But the left side is a multiple of \( b \). The only multiple of \( b \) in \( (-b, b) \) is 0. So \( q_1 = q_2 \), and then \( r_1 = r_2 \).

Therefore, the representation is unique.

**So, for \( b > 0 \), the statement holds.**

Now, what if \( b < 0 \)? As noted, the condition \( 2b \leq r < 3b \) is problematic. But if we interpret it as \( 3b < r \leq 2b \) (which is the correct non-empty interval when \( b < 0 \)), then we can do a similar shift.

Let \( b < 0 \). Write \( b = -|b| \). Then we want \( r \) such that \( 2b \leq r < 3b \). Since \( b \) is negative, this is equivalent to \( 3b < r \leq 2b \) (because multiplying by negative reverses inequalities). Actually, careful: The original is \( 2b \leq r < 3b \). For \( b < 0 \), \( 2b > 3b \) (e.g., \( b=-5: 2b=-10, 3b=-15 \), and \(-10 > -15\)). So the inequality \( 2b \leq r < 3b \) means \( r \) is both \( \geq -10 \) and \( < -15 \), which is impossible. Therefore, the statement is only meaningful for \( b > 0 \).

Thus, we assume \( b > 0 \).

**Lean Statement:**

We'll prove the theorem for \( b > 0 \).

**Output in normal language:**

We prove that for any integers \( a \) and \( b \) with \( b > 0 \), there exist unique integers \( q \) and \( r \) such that \( a = qb + r \) and \( 2b \leq r < 3b \).

**Existence:** By the division algorithm, there exist unique integers \( q' \) and \( r' \) with \( 0 \leq r' < b \) such that \( a = q'b + r' \). Define \( q = q' - 2 \) and \( r = r' + 2b \). Then \( a = (q' - 2)b + (r' + 2b) = qb + r \), and since \( 0 \leq r' < b \), we have \( 2b \leq r' + 2b < 3b \), so \( 2b \leq r < 3b \).

**Uniqueness:** Suppose \( a = q_1 b + r_1 = q_2 b + r_2 \) with \( 2b \leq r_1, r_2 < 3b \). Then \( (q_1 - q_2)b = r_2 - r_1 \). The right side satisfies \( -b < r_2 - r_1 < b \) because both \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) are in \([2b, 3b)\). The left side is an integer multiple of \( b \). The only multiple of \( b \) in \( (-b, b) \) is 0. Thus \( q_1 = q_2 \), and then \( r_1 = r_2 \).

Therefore, the representation is unique.

Note: The statement assumes \( b > 0 \). For \( b < 0 \), the condition \( 2b \leq r < 3b \) is not meaningful (as it defines an empty set), so we restrict to \( b > 0 \).
