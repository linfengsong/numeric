Let's analyze the statement:

We are given integers \( a \) and \( b \) with \( b \neq 0 \). We want to prove that there exist unique integers \( q \) and \( r \) such that:
\[ a = qb + r \quad \text{with} \quad 2b \leq r < 3b. \]

This is a variation of the division algorithm. Normally, the division algorithm gives \( 0 \leq r < |b| \). Here, the remainder \( r \) is constrained to lie in the interval \([2b, 3b)\).

**Observation:**
The condition \( 2b \leq r < 3b \) can be rewritten by shifting. Let \( r' = r - 2b \). Then:
\[ 0 \leq r' < b. \]
So we have:
\[ a = qb + r = qb + (r' + 2b) = (q+2)b + r', \quad \text{with} \quad 0 \leq r' < |b|. \]

But note: the standard division algorithm gives:
\[ a = q_0 b + r_0, \quad \text{with} \quad 0 \leq r_0 < |b|. \]
Then we can set:
\[ q = q_0 - 2, \quad r = r_0 + 2b. \]
Then:
\[ a = (q_0 - 2)b + (r_0 + 2b) = q_0 b + r_0, \]
and the condition becomes:
\[ 2b \leq r = r_0 + 2b < 2b + |b|. \]
But we need \( r < 3b \), so we require \( |b| = b \), meaning \( b > 0 \). Actually, the problem states \( b \neq 0 \), but does not specify positive. However, the inequality \( 2b \leq r < 3b \) only makes sense if \( b > 0 \) (because if \( b < 0 \), then \( 2b > 3b \), so the interval is empty). Therefore, we must assume \( b > 0 \).

So assume \( b > 0 \). Then the standard division algorithm gives:
\[ a = q_0 b + r_0, \quad 0 \leq r_0 < b. \]
Define:
\[ q = q_0 - 2, \quad r = r_0 + 2b. \]
Then:
\[ a = (q_0 - 2)b + (r_0 + 2b) = q_0 b + r_0, \]
and:
\[ 2b \leq r = r_0 + 2b < b + 2b = 3b. \]
So indeed \( 2b \leq r < 3b \).

Uniqueness: Suppose also \( a = q_1 b + r_1 \) with \( 2b \leq r_1 < 3b \). Then:
\[ qb + r = q_1 b + r_1 \implies (q - q_1)b = r_1 - r. \]
Since \( 2b \leq r, r_1 < 3b \), we have \( -b < r_1 - r < b \). So \( |r_1 - r| < b \). But \( r_1 - r \) is a multiple of \( b \). The only multiple of \( b \) with absolute value less than \( b \) is 0. So \( r_1 = r \), and then \( q = q_1 \).

Therefore, for \( b > 0 \), the representation exists and is unique.

But what if \( b < 0 \)? Then the condition \( 2b \leq r < 3b \) is problematic because \( 2b > 3b \) (e.g., if \( b = -1 \), then \( -2 \leq r < -3 \), which is impossible). So the statement should assume \( b > 0 \).

So we restate: Let \( a \) and \( b \) be integers with \( b > 0 \). Then there exist unique integers \( q \) and \( r \) such that:
\[ a = qb + r, \quad \text{with} \quad 2b \leq r < 3b. \]

**Proof:**
By the division algorithm, there exist unique \( q_0, r_0 \) with:
\[ a = q_0 b + r_0, \quad 0 \leq r_0 < b. \]
Define \( q = q_0 - 2 \) and \( r = r_0 + 2b \). Then:
\[ a = (q_0 - 2)b + (r_0 + 2b) = q_0 b + r_0, \]
and:
\[ 2b \leq r_0 + 2b < b + 2b = 3b, \]
so \( 2b \leq r < 3b \).

Uniqueness: As argued above.

Thus, the statement holds for \( b > 0 \).

In Lean, we can state this as:

```lean
theorem exists_unique_q_r (a : ℤ) (b : ℤ) (h : b > 0) :
    ∃! (q : ℤ) (r : ℤ), a = q * b + r ∧ 2 * b ≤ r ∧ r < 3 * b := by

  have hab : a = q0 * b + r0 := by rw [hq0_def, hr0_def]; exact Int.ediv_add_emod a b

    have : 0 ≤ r' - 2 * b := by linarith
    have hdiv_unique := Int.div_mod_unique (h : b ≠ 0) (by linear_combination ha - (q' * b + r' - a))? 
    -- Actually, we need to show that q' = q0 - 2 and r' = r0 + 2*b.
    -- Alternatively, from a = q' * b + r' and a = (q0-2)*b + (r0+2*b), we get:
    -- (q' - (q0-2)) * b = (r0+2*b) - r'
    -- So the difference is a multiple of b, but bounded: |(r0+2*b) - r'| < b (since both in [2b,3b))
    -- So must be zero.
    have hdiff : (q' - (q0 - 2)) * b = (r0 + 2 * b) - r' := by linear_combination ha - hab
    have hbound : -b < (r0 + 2 * b) - r' < b := by
      constructor
      · linarith [hr0.2, hr2]
      · linarith [hr0.1, hr1]
    -- Since it is a multiple of b, and strictly between -b and b, it must be 0.
    have hmult : b ∣ (r0 + 2 * b) - r' := by
      rw [← hdiff]
      exact ⟨q' - (q0 - 2), by ring⟩
    have : (r0 + 2 * b) - r' = 0 := by
      apply Int.eq_zero_of_dvd_of_abs_lt_abs hmult

    have : q' = q0 - 2 := by
      linear_combination hdiff + (r0 + 2 * b - r')
    constructor <;> assumption
```

But note: The above Lean proof might need some adjustments. Actually, we can use:

Since \( (q' - (q_0 - 2)) * b = (r_0 + 2b) - r' \), and \( |(r_0 + 2b) - r'| < b \), the only integer multiple of \( b \) with absolute value less than \( b \) is 0. So \( (r_0 + 2b) - r' = 0 \) and \( q' - (q_0 - 2) = 0 \).

In Lean, we can use:

```lean
have h1 : |(r0 + 2 * b) - r'| < |b| := by
  have : |(r0 + 2 * b) - r'| < b := by
    rw [abs_lt]
    constructor
    · linarith [hr0.2, hr2]  -- (r0+2b) - r' > -b
    · linarith [hr0.1, hr1]   -- (r0+2b) - r' < b
  exact by exact?
```

Then use `Int.eq_zero_of_dvd_of_abs_lt_abs`:

```lean
have hdiv : b ∣ (r0 + 2 * b) - r' := by
  rw [← hdiff]
  exact exists_eq_mul_right.mp (by use q' - (q0 - 2))
have heq : (r0 + 2 * b) - r' = 0 :=
  Int.eq_zero_of_dvd_of_abs_lt_abs hdiv h1
```

Then conclude.

So the full Lean code:

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Int.Basic

theorem exists_unique_q_r (a : ℤ) (b : ℤ) (h : b > 0) :
    ∃! (q : ℤ) (r : ℤ), a = q * b + r ∧ 2 * b ≤ r ∧ r < 3 * b := by

  have hab : a = q0 * b + r0 := by
    rw [hq0_def, hr0_def]
    exact Int.ediv_add_emod a b
  refine ⟨q0 - 2, r0 + 2 * b, ⟨?_, by linarith [hr0.1], by linarith [hr0.2]⟩, ?_⟩
  · linear_combination hab
  intro q' r' ⟨ha, hr1, hr2⟩
  have hdiff : (q' - (q0 - 2)) * b = (r0 + 2 * b) - r' := by
    linear_combination ha - hab
  have h1 : |(r0 + 2 * b) - r'| < |b| := by
    rw [abs_of_pos h]
    have : -b < (r0 + 2 * b) - r' ∧ (r0 + 2 * b) - r' < b := by
      constructor <;> linarith
    exact abs_lt.mpr this
  have hdiv : b ∣ (r0 + 2 * b) - r' := by
    rw [← hdiff]
    exact ⟨q' - (q0 - 2), by ring⟩
  have heq : (r0 + 2 * b) - r' = 0 :=
    Int.eq_zero_of_dvd_of_abs_lt_abs hdiv h1
  have hr_eq : r' = r0 + 2 * b := by linarith
  have hq_eq : q' = q0 - 2 := by
    linear_combination hdiff + heq
  exact ⟨hq_eq, hr_eq⟩
```

This should work.

**Output in normal language:**

We prove that for integers \( a \) and \( b \) with \( b > 0 \), there exist unique integers \( q \) and \( r \) such that \( a = qb + r \) and \( 2b \leq r < 3b \).

Proof: By the standard division algorithm, there exist unique integers \( q_0 \) and \( r_0 \) with \( a = q_0 b + r_0 \) and \( 0 \leq r_0 < b \). Define \( q = q_0 - 2 \) and \( r = r_0 + 2b \). Then:
\[ a = (q_0 - 2)b + (r_0 + 2b) = q_0 b + r_0, \]
and \( 2b \leq r_0 + 2b < 3b \), so the existence is shown.

For uniqueness, suppose \( a = q'b + r' \) with \( 2b \leq r' < 3b \). Then subtracting from \( a = (q_0-2)b + (r_0+2b) \) gives:
\[ (q' - (q_0-2))b = (r_0+2b) - r'. \]
The right-hand side has absolute value less than \( b \) (since both \( r' \) and \( r_0+2b \) are in \([2b, 3b)\)), so it must be zero. Hence \( r' = r_0+2b \) and \( q' = q_0-2 \), proving uniqueness.

Thus the statement holds. Note that \( b \) must be positive for the interval \([2b, 3b)\) to be non-empty.
