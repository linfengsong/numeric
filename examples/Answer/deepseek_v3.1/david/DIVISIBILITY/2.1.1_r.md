### Step-by-Step Proofs

#### (a) A number is triangular if and only if it is of the form \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \) for some \( n \geq 1 \). (Pythagoras)

**Proof:**
- A triangular number \( T_k \) is defined as the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers:
  \[
  T_k = 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}.
  \]
  This is the well-known formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
- Conversely, if a number \( m \) can be written as \( m = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) for some integer \( n \geq 1 \), then by definition it is the sum of the first \( n \) integers and hence triangular.

**Conclusion:**  
A number is triangular if and only if it equals \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) for some integer \( n \geq 1 \).

#### (b) The integer \( n \) is a triangular number if and only if \( 8n + 1 \) is a perfect square. (Plutarch)

**Proof:**
- If \( n \) is triangular, then \( n = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) for some \( k \). Then:
  \[
  8n + 1 = 8 \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + 1 = 4k(k+1) + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = (2k + 1)^2,
  \]
  which is a perfect square.
- Conversely, suppose \( 8n + 1 = m^2 \) for some integer \( m \). Since \( 8n + 1 \) is odd, \( m \) is odd. Let \( m = 2k + 1 \). Then:
  \[
  (2k + 1)^2 = 8n + 1 \implies 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 8n + 1 \implies 4k(k+1) = 8n \implies n = \frac{k(k+1)}{2},
  \]
  so \( n \) is triangular.

**Conclusion:**  
\( n \) is triangular if and only if \( 8n + 1 \) is a perfect square.

#### (c) The sum of any two consecutive triangular numbers is a perfect square. (Nicomachus)

**Proof:**
- Let \( T_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) and \( T_{k+1} = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} \). Then:
  \[
  T_k + T_{k+1} = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} = \frac{(k+1)(k + k + 2)}{2} = \frac{(k+1)(2k + 2)}{2} = \frac{2(k+1)^2}{2} = (k+1)^2,
  \]
  which is a perfect square.

**Conclusion:**  
The sum of two consecutive triangular numbers is always a perfect square.

#### (d) If \( n \) is a triangular number, then so are \( 9n + 1 \), \( 25n + 3 \), and \( 49n + 6 \). (Euler)

**Proof:**
Let \( n = T_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).

1. **For \( 9n + 1 \):**
   \[
   9n + 1 = 9 \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + 1 = \frac{9k(k+1) + 2}{2}.
   \]
   We want to show this equals \( T_m = \frac{m(m+1)}{2} \) for some \( m \). Observe:
   \[
   \frac{9k(k+1) + 2}{2} = \frac{(3k+1)(3k+2)}{2} = T_{3k+1},
   \]
   since \( (3k+1)(3k+2) = 9k^2 + 9k + 2 \). So \( 9n + 1 = T_{3k+1} \).

2. **For \( 25n + 3 \):**
   \[
   25n + 3 = 25 \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + 3 = \frac{25k(k+1) + 6}{2}.
   \]
   Note:
   \[
   (5k+2)(5k+3) = 25k^2 + 25k + 6,
   \]
   so:
   \[
   \frac{25k(k+1) + 6}{2} = \frac{(5k+2)(5k+3)}{2} = T_{5k+2}.
   \]

3. **For \( 49n + 6 \):**
   \[
   49n + 6 = 49 \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + 6 = \frac{49k(k+1) + 12}{2}.
   \]
   Note:
   \[
   (7k+3)(7k+4) = 49k^2 + 49k + 12,
   \]
   so:
   \[
   \frac{49k(k+1) + 12}{2} = \frac{(7k+3)(7k+4)}{2} = T_{7k+3}.
   \]

**Conclusion:**  
If \( n = T_k \), then:
- \( 9n + 1 = T_{3k+1} \),
- \( 25n + 3 = T_{5k+2} \),
- \( 49n + 6 = T_{7k+3} \),
all of which are triangular.

- (c) The sum of consecutive triangular numbers is a square.
- (d) The closure properties under linear transformations \( 9n+1 \), \( 25n+3 \), and \( 49n+6 \).
