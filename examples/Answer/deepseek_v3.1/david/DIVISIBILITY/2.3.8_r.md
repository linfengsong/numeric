Let's prove each statement step by step.

### (a) The sum of the squares of two odd integers cannot be a perfect square.

**Proof:**
Let the two odd integers be \( a = 2m + 1 \) and \( b = 2n + 1 \), where \( m, n \in \mathbb{Z} \).
Then,
\[
a^2 + b^2 = (2m+1)^2 + (2n+1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 + 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = 4(m^2 + m + n^2 + n) + 2.
\]
So, \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \).

Now, consider a perfect square modulo 4. For any integer \( k \):
- If \( k \) is even, \( k = 2t \), then \( k^2 = 4t^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \).
- If \( k \) is odd, \( k = 2t+1 \), then \( k^2 = 4t^2 + 4t + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).

Thus, a perfect square is always congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. However, \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \), which is not possible for a perfect square. Therefore, the sum of the squares of two odd integers cannot be a perfect square.

**Conclusion:** The statement is true.

### (b) The product of four consecutive integers is 1 less than a perfect square.

**Proof:**
Let the four consecutive integers be \( n, n+1, n+2, n+3 \), where \( n \in \mathbb{Z} \).
Consider their product:
\[
P = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3).
\]
Group the terms:
\[
P = [n(n+3)] \cdot [(n+1)(n+2)] = (n^2 + 3n)(n^2 + 3n + 2).
\]
Let \( k = n^2 + 3n \). Then,
\[
P = k(k+2) = k^2 + 2k.
\]
Now, observe:
\[
(k+1)^2 = k^2 + 2k + 1 = P + 1.
\]
So,
\[
P = (k+1)^2 - 1,
\]
which is exactly 1 less than the perfect square \( (k+1)^2 \).

Therefore, the product of four consecutive integers is always 1 less than a perfect square.

**Conclusion:** The statement is true.

### Summary:
- (a) The sum of the squares of two odd integers is congruent to 2 modulo 4, while perfect squares are only 0 or 1 modulo 4. Hence, it cannot be a perfect square.
- (b) For any integer \( n \), the product \( n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) = (n^2 + 3n + 1)^2 - 1 \), which is 1 less than a perfect square.

Both statements are proven.
