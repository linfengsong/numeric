Let \( a \) be an integer. We want to show that \( 3a^2 - 1 \) is never a perfect square.

Assume for contradiction that \( 3a^2 - 1 = k^2 \) for some integer \( k \). Then:
\[
3a^2 - k^2 = 1.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
k^2 = 3a^2 - 1.
\]
Consider modulo 3:
- Any integer squared modulo 3 is either 0 or 1 (since \(0^2 \equiv 0\), \(1^2 \equiv 1\), \(2^2 \equiv 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\)).
- So \( k^2 \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \pmod{3} \).
- Also, \( 3a^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), so \( 3a^2 - 1 \equiv -1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).

Therefore:
\[
k^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}.
\]
But \( k^2 \) modulo 3 can only be 0 or 1, never 2. This is a contradiction.

Hence, \( 3a^2 - 1 \) cannot be a perfect square for any integer \( a \).

**Output in Normal Language:**
We proved that for any integer \( a \), the expression \( 3a^2 - 1 \) is never a perfect square. This is because if it were equal to some integer \( k \) squared, then \( k^2 \) would be congruent to 2 modulo 3. However, squares modulo 3 can only be 0 or 1, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, no such \( k \) exists.
