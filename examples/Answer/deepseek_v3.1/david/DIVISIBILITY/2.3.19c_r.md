### Explanation in Normal Language

**Proof that if a and b are odd integers, then 8 divides (a² - b²):**

Since a and b are odd integers, we can write them as:
- a = 2k + 1 for some integer k
- b = 2l + 1 for some integer l

We then compute:
a² - b² = (2k + 1)² - (2l + 1)² = (4k² + 4k + 1) - (4l² + 4l + 1) = 4(k² + k - l² - l)

This simplifies to: 4[(k² + k) - (l² + l)] = 4[k(k + 1) - l(l + 1)]

Now, note that for any integer n, the product n(n + 1) is always even (since one of two consecutive integers must be even). Therefore:
- k(k + 1) is divisible by 2
- l(l + 1) is divisible by 2

Thus, k(k + 1) - l(l + 1) is also divisible by 2, meaning we can write:
k(k + 1) - l(l + 1) = 2m for some integer m

Substituting back:
a² - b² = 4 × 2m = 8m

This shows that a² - b² is divisible by 8, completing the proof.

**Conclusion:** For any odd integers a and b, the difference of their squares (a² - b²) is always divisible by 8.
