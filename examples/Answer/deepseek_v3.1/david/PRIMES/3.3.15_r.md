I'll solve this step by step.

First, let's define what we're looking for: sets of five consecutive odd integers where exactly four are prime numbers.

Let the five consecutive odd integers be: n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8

We need exactly four of these to be prime.

Let me find the first few examples:

**Set 1:** 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
- Primes: 3, 5, 7, 11 (4 primes)
- Composite: 9

**Set 2:** 5, 7, 9, 11, 13  
- Primes: 5, 7, 11, 13 (4 primes)
- Composite: 9

**Set 3:** 7, 9, 11, 13, 15
- Primes: 7, 11, 13 (only 3 primes)
- Composites: 9, 15

**Set 4:** 11, 13, 15, 17, 19
- Primes: 11, 13, 17, 19 (4 primes)
- Composite: 15

**Set 5:** 13, 15, 17, 19, 21
- Primes: 13, 17, 19 (only 3 primes)
- Composites: 15, 21

**Set 6:** 17, 19, 21, 23, 25
- Primes: 17, 19, 23 (only 3 primes)
- Composites: 21, 25

**Set 7:** 19, 21, 23, 25, 27
- Primes: 19, 23 (only 2 primes)
- Composites: 21, 25, 27

**Set 8:** 23, 25, 27, 29, 31
- Primes: 23, 29, 31 (only 3 primes)
- Composites: 25, 27

**Set 9:** 29, 31, 33, 35, 37
- Primes: 29, 31, 37 (only 3 primes)
- Composites: 33, 35

**Set 10:** 31, 33, 35, 37, 39
- Primes: 31, 37 (only 2 primes)
- Composites: 33, 35, 39

**Set 11:** 41, 43, 45, 47, 49
- Primes: 41, 43, 47 (only 3 primes)
- Composites: 45, 49

**Set 12:** 101, 103, 105, 107, 109
- Primes: 101, 103, 107, 109 (4 primes)
- Composite: 105

So I've found five sets:
1. {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}
2. {5, 7, 9, 11, 13}
3. {11, 13, 15, 17, 19}
4. {101, 103, 105, 107, 109}
5. {107, 109, 111, 113, 115} (primes: 107, 109, 113; composite: 111, 115) - only 3 primes

Let me find one more:
**Set 13:** {191, 193, 195, 197, 199}
- Primes: 191, 193, 197, 199 (4 primes)
- Composite: 195

Now I have five valid sets:
1. {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}
2. {5, 7, 9, 11, 13} 
3. {11, 13, 15, 17, 19}
4. {101, 103, 105, 107, 109}
5. {191, 193, 195, 197, 199}

Let me verify each:
1. 3✓, 5✓, 7✓, 9×, 11✓ (4 primes)
2. 5✓, 7✓, 9×, 11✓, 13✓ (4 primes) 
3. 11✓, 13✓, 15×, 17✓, 19✓ (4 primes)
4. 101✓, 103✓, 105×, 107✓, 109✓ (4 primes)
5. 191✓, 193✓, 195×, 197✓, 199✓ (4 primes)

Perfect! Here are five sets of five consecutive odd integers where exactly four are prime numbers.

**Five sets:**
1. {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}
2. {5, 7, 9, 11, 13}
3. {11, 13, 15, 17, 19} 
4. {101, 103, 105, 107, 109}
5. {191, 193, 195, 197, 199}

The question about whether there exist infinitely many such sets remains an open problem in number theory, related to prime constellations and prime k-tuples conjectures.
