I can provide five solutions to the equation \(d_n = d_{n+1}\), where \(d_n = p_{n+1} - p_n\):

1. \(n = 2\): \(d_2 = p_3 - p_2 = 5 - 3 = 2\), \(d_3 = p_4 - p_3 = 7 - 5 = 2\)
2. \(n = 5\): \(d_5 = p_6 - p_5 = 13 - 11 = 2\), \(d_6 = p_7 - p_6 = 17 - 13 = 4\) ❌
   Correction: Actually \(d_5 = p_6 - p_5 = 13 - 11 = 2\), \(d_6 = p_7 - p_6 = 17 - 13 = 4\) - this doesn't work.

Let me find actual solutions:

1. \(n = 2\): \(p_2=3, p_3=5, p_4=7\) → \(d_2=2, d_3=2\)
2. \(n = 3\): \(p_3=5, p_4=7, p_5=11\) → \(d_3=2, d_4=4\) ❌
3. \(n = 5\): \(p_5=11, p_6=13, p_7=17\) → \(d_5=2, d_6=4\) ❌

Let me find consecutive prime gaps that are equal:

1. \(n = 2\): \(3,5,7\) → gaps: \(2,2\)
2. \(n = 4\): \(7,11,13\) → gaps: \(4,2\) ❌
3. \(n = 6\): \(13,17,19\) → gaps: \(4,2\) ❌

Actually, let me find the correct solutions:

1. \(n = 2\): \(d_2 = p_3 - p_2 = 5 - 3 = 2\), \(d_3 = p_4 - p_3 = 7 - 5 = 2\)
2. \(n = 3\): \(d_3 = p_4 - p_3 = 7 - 5 = 2\), \(d_4 = p_5 - p_4 = 11 - 7 = 4\) ❌
3. \(n = 5\): \(d_5 = p_6 - p_5 = 13 - 11 = 2\), \(d_6 = p_7 - p_6 = 17 - 13 = 4\) ❌

Let me look for consecutive equal gaps:

1. \(n = 2\): gaps \(2,2\) (primes: 3,5,7)
2. \(n = 8\): \(p_8=19, p_9=23, p_{10}=29\) → gaps: \(4,6\) ❌
3. \(n = 10\): \(p_{10}=29, p_{11}=31, p_{12}=37\) → gaps: \(2,6\) ❌

Actually, let me find the known solutions:

1. \(n = 2\): \(d_2 = d_3 = 2\)
2. \(n = 15\): \(p_{15}=47, p_{16}=53, p_{17}=59\) → \(d_{15}=6, d_{16}=6\)
3. \(n = 36\): \(p_{36}=151, p_{37}=157, p_{38}=163\) → \(d_{36}=6, d_{37}=6\)
4. \(n = 39\): \(p_{39}=167, p_{40}=173, p_{41}=179\) → \(d_{39}=6, d_{40}=6\)
5. \(n = 46\): \(p_{46}=199, p_{47}=211, p_{48}=223\) → \(d_{46}=12, d_{47}=12\)

Here are five actual solutions:

1. \(n = 2\): \(d_2 = d_3 = 2\) (primes: 3, 5, 7)
2. \(n = 15\): \(d_{15} = d_{16} = 6\) (primes: 47, 53, 59)
3. \(n = 36\): \(d_{36} = d_{37} = 6\) (primes: 151, 157, 163)
4. \(n = 39\): \(d_{39} = d_{40} = 6\) (primes: 167, 173, 179)
5. \(n = 46\): \(d_{46} = d_{47} = 12\) (primes: 199, 211, 223)

These are five instances where consecutive prime gaps are equal: \(d_n = d_{n+1}\).

```

Five solutions to the equation \(d_n = d_{n+1}\) (where \(d_n = p_{n+1} - p_n\)) are:
- At \(n=2\): \(d_2 = d_3 = 2\) (primes: 3, 5, 7)
- At \(n=15\): \(d_{15} = d_{16} = 6\) (primes: 47, 53, 59)
- At \(n=36\): \(d_{36} = d_{37} = 6\) (primes: 151, 157, 163)
- At \(n=39\): \(d_{39} = d_{40} = 6\) (primes: 167, 173, 179)
- At \(n=46\): \(d_{46} = d_{47} = 12\) (primes: 199, 211, 223)

These are specific instances where consecutive prime gaps are equal, though it remains an open question whether there are infinitely many such occurrences.
