Let's verify the claim for the integers 509 and 877.

### For 509:
We need to check if there exists a prime \( p \) and a nonnegative integer \( k \) such that:
\[ 509 = p + 2^k \]
This implies \( p = 509 - 2^k \). We need \( p \) to be prime and positive.

We test powers of 2 less than 509:
- \( 2^0 = 1 \): \( 509 - 1 = 508 \) (not prime, divisible by 2)
- \( 2^1 = 2 \): \( 509 - 2 = 507 \) (not prime, divisible by 3)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \): \( 509 - 4 = 505 \) (not prime, divisible by 5)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \): \( 509 - 8 = 501 \) (not prime, divisible by 3)
- \( 2^4 = 16 \): \( 509 - 16 = 493 \) (not prime, divisible by 17: \(493 ÷ 17 = 29\))
- \( 2^5 = 32 \): \( 509 - 32 = 477 \) (not prime, divisible by 3)
- \( 2^6 = 64 \): \( 509 - 64 = 445 \) (not prime, divisible by 5)
- \( 2^7 = 128 \): \( 509 - 128 = 381 \) (not prime, divisible by 3)
- \( 2^8 = 256 \): \( 509 - 256 = 253 \) (not prime, divisible by 11: \(253 ÷ 11 = 23\))
- \( 2^9 = 512 \): \( 509 - 512 = -3 \) (negative, not prime)

None of these yield a prime. Therefore, 509 cannot be expressed as the sum of a prime and a power of 2.

### For 877:
Similarly, we need \( p = 877 - 2^k \) to be prime.

Test powers of 2 less than 877:
- \( 2^0 = 1 \): \( 877 - 1 = 876 \) (not prime, even)
- \( 2^1 = 2 \): \( 877 - 2 = 875 \) (not prime, divisible by 5)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \): \( 877 - 4 = 873 \) (not prime, divisible by 3)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \): \( 877 - 8 = 869 \) (check if prime: divisible by 11? \(11 \times 79 = 869\), so not prime)
- \( 2^4 = 16 \): \( 877 - 16 = 861 \) (divisible by 3: \(8+6+1=15\), divisible by 3)
- \( 2^5 = 32 \): \( 877 - 32 = 845 \) (divisible by 5)
- \( 2^6 = 64 \): \( 877 - 64 = 813 \) (divisible by 3: \(8+1+3=12\))
- \( 2^7 = 128 \): \( 877 - 128 = 749 \) (check: divisible by 7? \(7 \times 107 = 749\), not prime)
- \( 2^8 = 256 \): \( 877 - 256 = 621 \) (divisible by 3: \(6+2+1=9\))
- \( 2^9 = 512 \): \( 877 - 512 = 365 \) (divisible by 5)
- \( 2^{10} = 1024 \): \( 877 - 1024 = -147 \) (negative)

None yield a prime. Therefore, 877 also cannot be expressed as the sum of a prime and a power of 2.

### Conclusion:
Both 509 and 877 are counterexamples to de Polignac's claim that every odd integer is the sum of a prime and a power of 2.

### Lean Statement:
```lean
theorem counterexample_509 : ¬ ∃ (p : ℕ) (k : ℕ), p.prime ∧ 509 = p + 2^k := by
  native_decide

theorem counterexample_877 : ¬ ∃ (p : ℕ) (k : ℕ), p.prime ∧ 877 = p + 2^k := by
  native_decide
```

### Output in Normal Language:
The integers 509 and 877 cannot be written as the sum of a prime and a power of 2. This disproves de Polignac's claim that every odd integer has such a representation.
