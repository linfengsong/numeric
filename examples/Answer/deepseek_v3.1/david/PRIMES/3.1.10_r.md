### Step 1. Understand the Problem

We are given an odd prime \( p \neq 5 \). We need to show that at least one of \( p^2 - 1 \) or \( p^2 + 1 \) is divisible by 10.

Since 10 = 2 × 5, and we already know \( p \) is odd (so not divisible by 2), we focus on divisibility by 5.

### Step 2. Consider \( p \) Modulo 5

Because \( p \neq 5 \) is prime, \( p \) is not divisible by 5. So \( p \mod 5 \) can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We compute \( p^2 \mod 5 \) for each case:

- If \( p \equiv 1 \mod 5 \), then \( p^2 \equiv 1 \mod 5 \).
- If \( p \equiv 2 \mod 5 \), then \( p^2 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \).
- If \( p \equiv 3 \mod 5 \), then \( p^2 \equiv 9 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \).
- If \( p \equiv 4 \mod 5 \), then \( p^2 \equiv 16 \equiv 1 \mod 5 \).

So, \( p^2 \mod 5 \) is either 1 or 4.

### Step 3. Check \( p^2 - 1 \) and \( p^2 + 1 \) Modulo 5

- If \( p^2 \equiv 1 \mod 5 \), then \( p^2 - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 5 \).
- If \( p^2 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \), then \( p^2 + 1 \equiv 4 + 1 = 5 \equiv 0 \mod 5 \).

Therefore, in every case, either \( p^2 - 1 \) or \( p^2 + 1 \) is divisible by 5.

### Step 4. Check Divisibility by 2

Since \( p \) is odd, \( p^2 \) is odd. Then:
- \( p^2 - 1 \) is even (odd minus odd is even).
- \( p^2 + 1 \) is even (odd plus odd is even).

So both \( p^2 - 1 \) and \( p^2 + 1 \) are divisible by 2.

### Step 5. Conclusion

Since both numbers are divisible by 2, and one of them is divisible by 5, that one is divisible by 10 (because 2 and 5 are coprime).

Hence, for any odd prime \( p \neq 5 \), either \( p^2 - 1 \) or \( p^2 + 1 \) is divisible by 10.

**Note:** The Lean proof above is a sketch. It requires filling in some details (like proving `p` is odd from `hodd` and `hp`). The key idea is to use the fact that `p mod 5` is in {1,2,3,4} and then case analysis. Also, we use that 2 and 5 are coprime to combine the divisibility.

### Output in Normal Language

We have shown that for any odd prime \( p \neq 5 \), the square \( p^2 \) modulo 5 is either 1 or 4. If \( p^2 \equiv 1 \mod 5 \), then \( p^2 - 1 \) is divisible by 5. If \( p^2 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \), then \( p^2 + 1 \) is divisible by 5. Additionally, since \( p \) is odd, both \( p^2 - 1 \) and \( p^2 + 1 \) are even. Therefore, one of them is divisible by both 2 and 5, hence by 10. This completes the proof.
