I will confirm Lagrange's conjecture for all odd integers from 7 through 75 by checking each number can be written as p₁ + 2p₂ where p₁ and p₂ are primes.

**Verification:**

7 = 3 + 2×2 ✓
9 = 5 + 2×2 ✓
11 = 5 + 2×3 ✓
13 = 7 + 2×3 ✓
15 = 5 + 2×5 ✓
17 = 7 + 2×5 ✓
19 = 5 + 2×7 ✓
21 = 7 + 2×7 ✓
23 = 13 + 2×5 ✓
25 = 19 + 2×3 ✓
27 = 13 + 2×7 ✓
29 = 19 + 2×5 ✓
31 = 17 + 2×7 ✓
33 = 19 + 2×7 ✓
35 = 29 + 2×3 ✓
37 = 31 + 2×3 ✓
39 = 29 + 2×5 ✓
41 = 31 + 2×5 ✓
43 = 37 + 2×3 ✓
45 = 31 + 2×7 ✓
47 = 41 + 2×3 ✓
49 = 43 + 2×3 ✓
51 = 37 + 2×7 ✓
53 = 47 + 2×3 ✓
55 = 41 + 2×7 ✓
57 = 43 + 2×7 ✓
59 = 53 + 2×3 ✓
61 = 47 + 2×7 ✓
63 = 53 + 2×5 ✓
65 = 59 + 2×3 ✓
67 = 61 + 2×3 ✓
69 = 59 + 2×5 ✓
71 = 61 + 2×5 ✓
73 = 67 + 2×3 ✓
75 = 61 + 2×7 ✓

**Conclusion:** Lagrange's conjecture holds true for all odd integers from 7 through 75. Each odd number in this range can indeed be expressed as the sum p₁ + 2p₂ where p₁ and p₂ are prime numbers.
