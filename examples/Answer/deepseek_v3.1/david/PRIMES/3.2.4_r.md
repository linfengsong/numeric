### (a) $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational for any prime $p$.

**Proof:**  
Assume, for contradiction, that $\sqrt{p}$ is rational. Then $\sqrt{p} = \frac{a}{b}$ for some coprime integers $a, b$ with $b \neq 0$. Squaring both sides gives $p = \frac{a^2}{b^2}$, so $a^2 = p b^2$. This implies $p \mid a^2$, and since $p$ is prime, $p \mid a$. Write $a = p k$ for some integer $k$. Then substituting, we get $(p k)^2 = p b^2$ ⇒ $p^2 k^2 = p b^2$ ⇒ $p k^2 = b^2$. Thus $p \mid b^2$, and again since $p$ is prime, $p \mid b$. But then $p$ divides both $a$ and $b$, contradicting that $a$ and $b$ are coprime. Hence, $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational. ∎

### (b) If $a$ is a positive integer and $\sqrt[n]{a}$ is rational, then $\sqrt[n]{a}$ must be an integer.

**Proof:**  
Let $\sqrt[n]{a} = \frac{p}{q}$ in lowest terms, with $q > 0$. Then $a = \frac{p^n}{q^n}$, so $p^n = a q^n$. This implies $q^n \mid p^n$. Since $\gcd(p, q) = 1$, we must have $q = 1$ (otherwise a prime dividing $q$ would divide $p$, contradiction). Thus $\sqrt[n]{a} = p$, an integer. ∎

### (c) For $n \geq 2$, $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is irrational.

**Proof:**  
Assume $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is rational. By part (b), since $n$ is a positive integer, $\sqrt[n]{n}$ must be an integer, say $k$. Then $k^n = n$. For $n \geq 2$, if $k = 1$, then $1^n = 1 \neq n$ (unless $n=1$, but $n \geq 2$). If $k \geq 2$, then $k^n \geq 2^n > n$ for $n \geq 2$ (since $2^2 = 4 > 2$, and $2^n$ grows faster than $n$). Thus no integer $k$ satisfies $k^n = n$ for $n \geq 2$. Contradiction. Hence, $\sqrt[n]{n}$ is irrational. ∎

### Lean Statement Confirmation

In Lean, these results can be formalized using the library of irrationality proofs. For example:

```lean
import data.real.irrational

-- (a) √p is irrational for prime p
lemma irrational_sqrt_prime (p : ℕ) [prime p] : irrational (real.sqrt p) :=
by exact irrational_sqrt_of_prime p

-- (b) If ⁿ√a is rational and a is a positive integer, then it is an integer.
-- This is a consequence of the rational root theorem or properties of integers.
lemma nth_root_rational_implies_integer (a n : ℕ) (ha : a > 0) (h : ∃ (r : ℚ), (r : ℝ)^n = a) :
  ∃ (k : ℕ), (k : ℝ)^n = a :=
...  -- Proof details omitted, but relies on the fact that if (p/q)^n = a then q=1.

-- (c) For n ≥ 2, ⁿ√n is irrational.
lemma irrational_nth_root_n (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 2) : irrational (n : ℝ)^(1/(n : ℝ)) :=
by
  intro h
  have := nth_root_rational_implies_integer n n (by linarith) h
  rcases this with ⟨k, hk⟩
  -- Then k^n = n, but for n≥2, k=1 gives 1 ≠ n, and k≥2 gives k^n ≥ 2^n > n.
  ...  -- Contradiction
```

The exact Lean code may vary based on the library, but the mathematical reasoning is as above.

### Output in Normal Language

- **(a)** The square root of any prime number is irrational. This is proven by assuming it is rational and deriving a contradiction (that the prime would divide both numerator and denominator, violating coprimality).
  
- **(b)** If the $n$-th root of a positive integer $a$ is rational, then it must actually be an integer. This is because if written in lowest terms, the denominator must be 1.

- **(c)** For every integer $n \geq 2$, the $n$-th root of $n$ is irrational. If it were rational, it would have to be an integer by (b), but no integer $k$ satisfies $k^n = n$ for $n \geq 2$ (since $1^n = 1 \neq n$ and $k^n$ for $k \geq 2$ is too large).
