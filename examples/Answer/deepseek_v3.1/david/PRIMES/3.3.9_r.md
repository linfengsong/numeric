### (a) For \( n \ne 3 \), show that the integers \( n, n + 2, n + 4 \) cannot all be prime.

**Proof:**
Consider the integers modulo 3. Every integer \( n \) satisfies exactly one of:
- \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \)
- \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
- \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)

Now analyze each case:
1. If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), then \( n \) is divisible by 3. Since \( n \ne 3 \), \( n \) is composite (unless \( n = 3 \), which is excluded). So not all are prime.
2. If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), then \( n + 2 \equiv 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \). So \( n + 2 \) is divisible by 3. If \( n + 2 = 3 \), then \( n = 1 \) (not prime). Otherwise, \( n + 2 > 3 \) and composite. So not all prime.
3. If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 = 6 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \). So \( n + 4 \) is divisible by 3. If \( n + 4 = 3 \), then \( n = -1 \) (not prime). Otherwise, \( n + 4 > 3 \) and composite. So not all prime.

In every case, at least one of \( n, n+2, n+4 \) is divisible by 3 and greater than 3 (since \( n \ne 3 \)), hence composite. Therefore, they cannot all be prime. ∎

### (b) Three integers \( p, p + 2, p + 6 \), which are all prime, are called a prime-triplet. Find five sets of prime-triplets.

Here are five prime-triplets (with \( p, p+2, p+6 \) all prime):

1. \( p = 5 \):  
   \( 5, 7, 11 \) are all prime.

2. \( p = 11 \):  
   \( 11, 13, 17 \) are all prime.

3. \( p = 17 \):  
   \( 17, 19, 23 \) are all prime.

4. \( p = 41 \):  
   \( 41, 43, 47 \) are all prime.

5. \( p = 101 \):  
   \( 101, 103, 107 \) are all prime.

These are five examples of prime-triplets.

*Note: The Lean proof above is a sketch. A complete formalization would require more details, especially handling the primality conditions and the case distinctions properly. The above code outlines the modulo argument and the contradictions in each case.*
