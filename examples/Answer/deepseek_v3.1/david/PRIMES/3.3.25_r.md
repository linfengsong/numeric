I need to prove that for n > 3, the nth prime is less than the sum of all previous primes.

Let me denote:
- p₁ = 2 (first prime)
- p₂ = 3 (second prime)
- p₃ = 5 (third prime)
- p₄ = 7 (fourth prime)
- etc.

The inequality to prove is: pₙ < p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₙ₋₁ for n > 3

Let me test this for n = 4:
p₄ = 7
Sum of previous primes: p₁ + p₂ + p₃ = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10
7 < 10 ✓

n = 5:
p₅ = 11
Sum: 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17
11 < 17 ✓

n = 6:
p₆ = 13
Sum: 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 28
13 < 28 ✓

The pattern seems to hold. Now I need a general proof.

I recall Bertrand's Postulate (proven by Chebyshev): For any integer n > 1, there exists at least one prime between n and 2n.

This might be useful. Let me think about the growth rate of primes vs their sums.

The sum of first k primes grows roughly like k²/2 log k (by the prime number theorem), while pₙ grows like n log n.

For large n, n log n grows slower than n²/2 log n, so asymptotically the inequality should hold.

But I need a rigorous proof. Let me try induction.

Base case: n = 4, we already verified p₄ = 7 < 2 + 3 + 5 = 10

Inductive step: Assume pₖ < p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₖ₋₁ for some k ≥ 4

Now consider pₖ₊₁. By Bertrand's Postulate, there's a prime between pₖ and 2pₖ.

But pₖ₊₁ is the next prime after pₖ, so pₖ₊₁ < 2pₖ

Now look at the sum: p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₖ
By inductive hypothesis, pₖ < p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₖ₋₁
So p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₖ = (p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₖ₋₁) + pₖ > pₖ + pₖ = 2pₖ

Therefore p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₖ > 2pₖ > pₖ₊₁

So pₖ₊₁ < p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₖ

This completes the induction.

Let me write this more formally:

**Proof by induction:**

Base case (n = 4): p₄ = 7, p₁ + p₂ + p₃ = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10, and 7 < 10.

Inductive step: Assume for some k ≥ 4, pₖ < p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₖ₋₁

We want to show pₖ₊₁ < p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₖ

By Bertrand's Postulate, there exists a prime between pₖ and 2pₖ. Since pₖ₊₁ is the next prime after pₖ, we have:
pₖ₊₁ < 2pₖ

From the inductive hypothesis:
p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₖ = (p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₖ₋₁) + pₖ > pₖ + pₖ = 2pₖ

Therefore:
pₖ₊₁ < 2pₖ < p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₖ

This completes the induction.

Thus, for all n > 3, pₙ < p₁ + p₂ + ... + pₙ₋₁

∎

The proof is complete and valid. The key steps are:
1. Verification of base case n=4
2. Use of Bertrand's Postulate to bound pₖ₊₁ < 2pₖ
3. Inductive hypothesis gives sum > 2pₖ
4. Combining these gives the desired inequality

**Lean statement:**
```lean
theorem prime_lt_sum_previous_primes (n : ℕ) (h : n > 3) : nat.prime (p n) → p n < (finset.range n).sum (λ i, p i) :=
```

**Normal language output:**
For any integer n greater than 3, the nth prime number is always less than the sum of all prime numbers that come before it. This can be proven using mathematical induction and Bertrand's Postulate, which guarantees that there's always a prime number between any number and its double. The base case n=4 holds (7 < 2+3+5=10), and the inductive step shows that if the statement holds for some k, it must also hold for k+1.
