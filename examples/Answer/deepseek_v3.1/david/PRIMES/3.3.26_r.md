I'll verify each of these statements:

(a) **True**. This follows from Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, which states that if a and d are coprime positive integers, then the arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ... contains infinitely many primes. Here, numbers ending in 33 are those congruent to 33 mod 100, and since gcd(33,100) = 1, there are infinitely many primes in this progression.

(b) **True**. While the twin prime conjecture (that there are infinitely many twin primes) remains unproven, it's known that most primes are not twin primes. In fact, the sum of reciprocals of twin primes converges (Brun's theorem), while the sum of reciprocals of all primes diverges, showing that twin primes are relatively sparse among all primes.

(c) **True**. This is a consequence of Dirichlet's theorem. For any number of consecutive 1's (say n ones), we can consider numbers ending with that pattern. These numbers are congruent to some number a mod 10^n where gcd(a,10^n) = 1 (since the number ends with 1), so there are infinitely many primes with this ending pattern.

(d) **True**. We can construct such primes using Dirichlet's theorem. Consider numbers of the form 123456789X where X is some digit string that makes the number prime. Since there are infinitely many primes (by Dirichlet) that contain the block 123456789 but have different endings, and only finitely many could potentially end with exactly 123456789, there must be infinitely many that contain but do not end with this block.

All four statements are mathematically valid and can be verified using established number theory results, particularly Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions.
