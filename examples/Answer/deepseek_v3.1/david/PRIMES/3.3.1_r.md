To verify that 1949 and 1951 are twin primes, we need to check that both are prime numbers and that they differ by 2.

First, check if 1949 is prime:
- 1949 is not even, so not divisible by 2.
- Sum of digits: 1+9+4+9=23, not divisible by 3.
- Check divisibility by primes up to sqrt(1949) ≈ 44.1.
Primes to check: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43.
- 1949 ÷ 5 = 389.8, not integer.
- 1949 ÷ 7 = 278.428..., not integer.
- 1949 ÷ 11 = 177.181..., not integer.
- 1949 ÷ 13 = 149.923..., not integer.
- 1949 ÷ 17 = 114.647..., not integer.
- 1949 ÷ 19 = 102.578..., not integer.
- 1949 ÷ 23 = 84.739..., not integer.
- 1949 ÷ 29 = 67.206..., not integer.
- 1949 ÷ 31 = 62.870..., not integer.
- 1949 ÷ 37 = 52.675..., not integer.
- 1949 ÷ 41 = 47.536..., not integer.
- 1949 ÷ 43 = 45.325..., not integer.
So, 1949 is prime.

Next, check if 1951 is prime:
- 1951 is not even.
- Sum of digits: 1+9+5+1=16, not divisible by 3.
- Check primes up to sqrt(1951) ≈ 44.17 (same primes as above).
- 1951 ÷ 5 = 390.2, not integer.
- 1951 ÷ 7 = 278.714..., not integer.
- 1951 ÷ 11 = 177.363..., not integer.
- 1951 ÷ 13 = 150.076..., not integer.
- 1951 ÷ 17 = 114.764..., not integer.
- 1951 ÷ 19 = 102.684..., not integer.
- 1951 ÷ 23 = 84.826..., not integer.
- 1951 ÷ 29 = 67.275..., not integer.
- 1951 ÷ 31 = 62.935..., not integer.
- 1951 ÷ 37 = 52.729..., not integer.
- 1951 ÷ 41 = 47.585..., not integer.
- 1951 ÷ 43 = 45.372..., not integer.
So, 1951 is prime.

Since both 1949 and 1951 are prime and differ by 2, they are twin primes.

Lean statement:
```lean
example : Nat.Prime 1949 ∧ Nat.Prime 1951 ∧ |1949 - 1951| = 2 := by
  native_decide
```

Output in normal language:
The integers 1949 and 1951 are both prime numbers and their difference is 2. Therefore, they are twin primes.
