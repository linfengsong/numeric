Here is a modification of Euclid's proof using factorial instead of the product of primes:

**Proof by Contradiction:**

1. **Assume** there is a largest prime number, call it p.
2. **Construct** the number N = p! + 1, where p! (p factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to p.
3. **Observe** that N is greater than p (since p! ≥ p and we're adding 1).
4. **Consider** what primes divide N:
   - For any prime q ≤ p, we have q divides p! (since q is one of the factors).
   - Therefore, q cannot divide N = p! + 1 (since dividing both p! and N would require q to divide their difference, which is 1).
   - So no prime ≤ p divides N.
5. **Conclude**:
   - Since N > 1, it must have at least one prime divisor (by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).
   - But we've shown that no prime ≤ p divides N.
   - Therefore, any prime divisor of N must be greater than p.
6. **Contradiction**: We found a prime larger than p, contradicting our assumption that p is the largest prime.

**Therefore**, our initial assumption is false, and there must be infinitely many primes.

**Output in Normal Language:**
This proof shows that for any natural number n, there exists a prime number p that is greater than or equal to n. The Lean code formalizes this by:
1. Taking an arbitrary n
2. Considering the number N = n! + 1
3. Showing N has a prime factor p
4. Proving that this prime p must be greater than n (since any prime ≤ n would divide n! but not n! + 1)
5. Concluding that p ≥ n and is prime

The proof demonstrates that no matter how large n is, we can always find a prime at least as large as n, establishing the infinitude of primes.
