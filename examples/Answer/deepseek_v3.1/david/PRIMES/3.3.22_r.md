Let \( n \) be an integer. Consider two successive integers of the form \( n^2 + 3 \) and \( (n+1)^2 + 3 \). We are to show that 13 is the largest prime that can divide both.

Let \( p \) be a prime that divides both \( n^2 + 3 \) and \( (n+1)^2 + 3 \). Then:
\[
p \mid n^2 + 3 \quad \text{and} \quad p \mid (n+1)^2 + 3 = n^2 + 2n + 1 + 3 = n^2 + 2n + 4.
\]
Since \( p \) divides both, it also divides their difference:
\[
p \mid \left[ (n^2 + 2n + 4) - (n^2 + 3) \right] = 2n + 1.
\]
So \( p \mid 2n + 1 \).

Now, since \( p \mid n^2 + 3 \) and \( p \mid 2n + 1 \), we can express \( n \) in terms of \( p \). From \( 2n + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \), we have \( n \equiv -\frac{1}{2} \pmod{p} \) (assuming \( p \neq 2 \), which we check separately).

Substitute \( n \equiv -\frac{1}{2} \) into \( n^2 + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \):
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \implies \frac{1}{4} + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \implies \frac{1 + 12}{4} \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \implies \frac{13}{4} \equiv 0 \pmod{p}.
\]
This implies \( 13 \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \), so \( p = 13 \).

Now check \( p = 2 \):
If \( p = 2 \), then \( n^2 + 3 \) and \( (n+1)^2 + 3 \) are both even. But \( n^2 + 3 \) is even if \( n \) is odd, and \( (n+1)^2 + 3 \) is even if \( n+1 \) is odd, i.e., \( n \) is even. So they cannot both be even for the same \( n \). Thus \( p \neq 2 \).

Therefore, the only prime that can divide both is \( p = 13 \). Hence, 13 is the largest (and only) prime that divides two successive integers of the form \( n^2 + 3 \).

To confirm with an example:
Let \( n = 5 \), then \( n^2 + 3 = 28 \) and \( (n+1)^2 + 3 = 39 \). Both divisible by 13.
Let \( n = 18 \), then \( n^2 + 3 = 327 \) and \( (n+1)^2 + 3 = 364 \), both divisible by 13.

Thus, 13 is the largest prime that can divide two successive integers of the form \( n^2 + 3 \).

**Output in normal language:**
We have shown that if a prime \( p \) divides both \( n^2 + 3 \) and \( (n+1)^2 + 3 \), then \( p \) must be 13. Additionally, 13 itself does divide such pairs (e.g., \( n=5 \) gives 28 and 39). No prime larger than 13 can divide two successive integers of this form, as 13 is the only possibility. Thus, 13 is the largest prime with this property.
