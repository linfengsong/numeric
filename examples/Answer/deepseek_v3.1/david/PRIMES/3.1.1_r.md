Let's find five primes of the form \( n^2 - 2 \):

1. For \( n = 2 \): \( 2^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 \), which is prime.
2. For \( n = 3 \): \( 3^2 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \), which is prime.
3. For \( n = 4 \): \( 4^2 - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14 \), not prime.
4. For \( n = 5 \): \( 5^2 - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \), which is prime.
5. For \( n = 6 \): \( 6^2 - 2 = 36 - 2 = 34 \), not prime.
6. For \( n = 7 \): \( 7^2 - 2 = 49 - 2 = 47 \), which is prime.
7. For \( n = 9 \): \( 9^2 - 2 = 81 - 2 = 79 \), which is prime.

So, five such primes are: 2, 7, 23, 47, 79.

Now, writing this in Lean:

```lean
example : ∃ (n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 : ℕ), nat.prime (n1^2 - 2) ∧ nat.prime (n2^2 - 2) ∧ nat.prime (n3^2 - 2) ∧ nat.prime (n4^2 - 2) ∧ nat.prime (n5^2 - 2) ∧
  n1^2 - 2 = 2 ∧ n2^2 - 2 = 7 ∧ n3^2 - 2 = 23 ∧ n4^2 - 2 = 47 ∧ n5^2 - 2 = 79 :=
begin
  refine ⟨2, 3, 5, 7, 9, _, _, _, _, _, rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl⟩,
  all_goals { simp [nat.prime] }
end
```

However, note that in Lean, subtraction on naturals is capped at 0 (so if \(a < b\), \(a - b = 0\)), but in our cases, \(n^2 \geq 2\) for \(n \geq 2\), so it's safe. Also, we need to provide proofs that these numbers are prime. Alternatively, we can use `norm_num` to compute and prove primality:

```lean
example : ∃ (n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 : ℕ), nat.prime (n1^2 - 2) ∧ nat.prime (n2^2 - 2) ∧ nat.prime (n3^2 - 2) ∧ nat.prime (n4^2 - 2) ∧ nat.prime (n5^2 - 2) ∧
  n1^2 - 2 = 2 ∧ n2^2 - 2 = 7 ∧ n3^2 - 2 = 23 ∧ n4^2 - 2 = 47 ∧ n5^2 - 2 = 79 :=
begin
  refine ⟨2, 3, 5, 7, 9, _, _, _, _, _, rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl⟩,
  all_goals { exact by norm_num }
end
```

But `norm_num` might not directly prove `nat.prime` for these numbers. We can use `dec_trivial` or specific lemmas. Actually, `norm_num` can handle small primes:

```lean
example : nat.prime 2 := by norm_num
example : nat.prime 7 := by norm_num
example : nat.prime 23 := by norm_num
example : nat.prime 47 := by norm_num
example : nat.prime 79 := by norm_num
```

So the full code:

```lean
example : ∃ (n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 : ℕ), nat.prime (n1^2 - 2) ∧ nat.prime (n2^2 - 2) ∧ nat.prime (n3^2 - 2) ∧ nat.prime (n4^2 - 2) ∧ nat.prime (n5^2 - 2) ∧
  n1^2 - 2 = 2 ∧ n2^2 - 2 = 7 ∧ n3^2 - 2 = 23 ∧ n4^2 - 2 = 47 ∧ n5^2 - 2 = 79 :=
begin
  refine ⟨2, 3, 5, 7, 9, by norm_num, by norm_num, by norm_num, by norm_num, by norm_num, rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl⟩,
end
```

This proves that for \(n=2,3,5,7,9\), the values \(n^2-2\) are the primes 2,7,23,47,79 respectively.

**Output in normal language:**
Five primes of the form \(n^2 - 2\) are 2 (from \(n=2\)), 7 (from \(n=3\)), 23 (from \(n=5\)), 47 (from \(n=7\)), and 79 (from \(n=9\)).
