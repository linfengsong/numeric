I'll find the prime factorization of each integer step by step.

### 1. Prime factorization of 1234

Let's factor 1234:
- 1234 ÷ 2 = 617 (1234 is even, so divisible by 2)
- 617 is a prime number (no smaller primes divide it)

Therefore, 1234 = 2 × 617

### 2. Prime factorization of 10140

Let's factor 10140:
- 10140 ÷ 2 = 5070 (even)
- 5070 ÷ 2 = 2535 (even)
- 2535 ÷ 3 = 845 (sum of digits 2+5+3+5=15, divisible by 3)
- 845 ÷ 5 = 169 (ends with 5, divisible by 5)
- 169 ÷ 13 = 13 (13² = 169)
- 13 is prime

Therefore, 10140 = 2² × 3 × 5 × 13²

### 3. Prime factorization of 36000

Let's factor 36000:
- 36000 ÷ 2 = 18000 (even)
- 18000 ÷ 2 = 9000 (even)
- 9000 ÷ 2 = 4500 (even)
- 4500 ÷ 2 = 2250 (even)
- 2250 ÷ 2 = 1125 (even)
- 1125 ÷ 3 = 375 (sum of digits 1+1+2+5=9, divisible by 3)
- 375 ÷ 3 = 125 (sum of digits 3+7+5=15, divisible by 3)
- 125 ÷ 5 = 25 (ends with 5, divisible by 5)
- 25 ÷ 5 = 5 (ends with 5, divisible by 5)
- 5 is prime

Therefore, 36000 = 2⁵ × 3² × 5³

### Summary:
- 1234 = 2 × 617
- 10140 = 2² × 3 × 5 × 13²
- 36000 = 2⁵ × 3² × 5³
