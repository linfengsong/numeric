### Step 1. Assume the Contrary
Assume there are only finitely many primes: \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \).

### Step 2. Define the Number \( N \)
Define the integer:
\[
N = p_2p_3 \cdots p_n + p_1p_3 \cdots p_n + \cdots + p_1p_2 \cdots p_{n-1}
\]
That is, \( N \) is the sum of \( n \) terms, where each term is the product of all primes except one (each term omits exactly one prime).

### Step 3. Analyze \( N \) Modulo Each Prime
Consider any prime \( p_k \) from our list. Look at the \( k \)-th term in the sum for \( N \):
\[
\text{Term}_k = p_1p_2 \cdots p_{k-1}p_{k+1} \cdots p_n
\]
This term is divisible by every prime except \( p_k \). In particular, it is divisible by \( p_k \) only if \( p_k \) divides one of the other primes, which is impossible (since primes are greater than 1 and distinct). Actually, more directly: since \( p_k \) is not a factor in this term, \( p_k \nmid \text{Term}_k \).

Now, every other term (say for \( j \ne k \)) contains \( p_k \) as a factor. Therefore:
\[
N \equiv \text{Term}_k \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p_k}
\]
So \( p_k \nmid N \) for every \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, n \).

### Step 4. Derive the Contradiction
Since no prime \( p_k \) divides \( N \), and \( N > 1 \) (because there is at least one prime, say 2, and \( N \ge 2 > 1 \)), \( N \) must have a prime factor not in our list. This contradicts the assumption that \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) are all the primes.

### Step 5. Conclusion
Therefore, the assumption that there are only finitely many primes is false. Hence, there are infinitely many primes.

### Lean 4 Statement (for verification)

```lean
theorem infinitude_primes : ∀ (L : List ℕ), (∀ p ∈ L, Nat.Prime p) → ∃ p, Nat.Prime p ∧ p ∉ L := by
  intro L h
  by_cases hL : L = []
  · exact ⟨2, Nat.prime_two, by simp [hL]⟩
  have := exists_prime_not_dvd (prod_primes_plus_one L h)
  -- Here we would need to define `prod_primes_plus_one` appropriately for this specific construction.
  -- The exact Lean code would depend on defining the integer N as above and showing it is coprime to each prime in L.
```

*Note: The exact Lean implementation would require defining the specific \( N \) and showing it is coprime to each prime in the list. The above is a sketch.*

### Output in Normal Language

We assume there are only finitely many primes: \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \). Define the number \( N \) as the sum of all products of \( n-1 \) of these primes (so each term misses exactly one prime). Then for any prime \( p_k \), we see that \( N \) is not divisible by \( p_k \), because every term except one is divisible by \( p_k \), and that one term is not. Hence \( N \) is not divisible by any of the primes in our list. But \( N > 1 \), so it must have a prime factor not in the list. This contradicts the assumption that the list contained all primes. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes.

This proof is due to **Euclid** (with this specific construction attributed by some to **Euler** or others, but the idea is classical). It is a variant of the common proofs of the infinitude of primes.
