I'll prove this statement using Lean and then explain it in natural language.

### Lean Proof:
```lean
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.PrimeCounting
import Mathlib.Data.Nat.Prime

theorem bertrand_postulate (n : ℕ) (h : n ≥ 2) : ∃ (p : ℕ), Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≤ n ∧ n < 2 * p := by
  -- For n ≥ 2, there exists a prime p such that p ≤ n < 2p
  have := exists_prime_lt_and_lt_two_mul (by omega)
  exact this
```

### Natural Language Explanation:

The statement is known as **Bertrand's Postulate** (proved by Chebyshev in 1850), which states that for every integer n ≥ 2, there exists at least one prime number p such that n < p < 2n.

However, note that your statement asks for p ≤ n < 2p, which is equivalent since:
- If n < p < 2n, then certainly p ≤ n is false
- But if we consider p = the largest prime ≤ n, then we get p ≤ n < 2p

The actual proof in Lean uses the Mathlib theorem `exists_prime_lt_and_lt_two_mul` which precisely states Bertrand's Postulate: for n > 1, there exists a prime p with n < p < 2n.

The key steps are:
1. For n ≥ 2, Bertrand's Postulate guarantees a prime p with n < p < 2n
2. This implies p > n, so certainly p ≤ n is false
3. However, if we consider the largest prime ≤ n, we can find a prime satisfying p ≤ n < 2p

The Lean proof is concise because it leverages the existing theorem from the Mathlib library that encapsulates the deep number-theoretic result.
