Let's analyze the conjecture: "Every positive integer can be written in the form \( p + a^2 \), where \( p \) is either a prime or 1, and \( a \geq 0 \)."

We need to find a counterexample, i.e., a positive integer \( n \) such that for every nonnegative integer \( a \), \( n - a^2 \) is neither prime nor 1.

Let's test small integers:

- \( n = 1 \): \( a = 0 \Rightarrow 1 - 0 = 1 \) (which is allowed since \( p \) can be 1). So 1 works.
- \( n = 2 \): \( a = 0 \Rightarrow 2 - 0 = 2 \) (prime). So 2 works.
- \( n = 3 \): \( a = 0 \Rightarrow 3 \) (prime); \( a=1 \Rightarrow 3-1=2 \) (prime). So 3 works.
- \( n = 4 \): \( a=0 \Rightarrow 4 \) (not prime or 1); \( a=1 \Rightarrow 3 \) (prime). So 4 works.
- \( n = 5 \): \( a=0 \Rightarrow 5 \) (prime); \( a=1 \Rightarrow 4 \) (not); \( a=2 \Rightarrow 1 \) (allowed). So 5 works.
- \( n = 6 \): \( a=0 \Rightarrow 6 \) (not); \( a=1 \Rightarrow 5 \) (prime). So 6 works.
- \( n = 7 \): \( a=0 \Rightarrow 7 \) (prime); \( a=1 \Rightarrow 6 \) (not); \( a=2 \Rightarrow 3 \) (prime). So 7 works.
- \( n = 8 \): \( a=0 \Rightarrow 8 \) (not); \( a=1 \Rightarrow 7 \) (prime). So 8 works.
- \( n = 9 \): \( a=0 \Rightarrow 9 \) (not); \( a=1 \Rightarrow 8 \) (not); \( a=2 \Rightarrow 5 \) (prime). So 9 works.
- \( n = 10 \): \( a=0 \Rightarrow 10 \) (not); \( a=1 \Rightarrow 9 \) (not); \( a=2 \Rightarrow 6 \) (not); \( a=3 \Rightarrow 1 \) (allowed). So 10 works.

Now let's try \( n = 25 \):
- \( a=0 \Rightarrow 25 \) (not prime or 1)
- \( a=1 \Rightarrow 24 \) (not)
- \( a=2 \Rightarrow 21 \) (not)
- \( a=3 \Rightarrow 16 \) (not)
- \( a=4 \Rightarrow 9 \) (not)
- \( a=5 \Rightarrow 0 \) (not allowed since \( p \) must be prime or 1, and 0 is neither)

So 25 does not work.

We can check \( n = 34 \):
- \( a=0 \Rightarrow 34 \) (not)
- \( a=1 \Rightarrow 33 \) (not)
- \( a=2 \Rightarrow 30 \) (not)
- \( a=3 \Rightarrow 25 \) (not)
- \( a=4 \Rightarrow 18 \) (not)
- \( a=5 \Rightarrow 9 \) (not)
- \( a=6 \Rightarrow -2 \) (invalid)

So 34 also does not work.

But 25 is smaller. Let's confirm 25 is indeed a counterexample:
For \( a = 0 \): \( 25 - 0 = 25 \) (not prime or 1)
\( a = 1 \): \( 25 - 1 = 24 \) (composite)
\( a = 2 \): \( 25 - 4 = 21 \) (composite)
\( a = 3 \): \( 25 - 9 = 16 \) (composite)
\( a = 4 \): \( 25 - 16 = 9 \) (composite)
\( a = 5 \): \( 25 - 25 = 0 \) (not allowed)

No nonnegative integer \( a \) gives \( p = 25 - a^2 \) that is prime or 1. Therefore, 25 is a counterexample.

Another known counterexample is 121, but 25 is smaller.

Thus, the integer 25 cannot be written in the form \( p + a^2 \) with \( p \) prime or 1 and \( a \geq 0 \).

Therefore, the conjecture is false.

In Lean, we can state this as:

```lean
example : ¬ (∀ n : ℕ, n > 0 → ∃ (a : ℕ) (p : ℕ), (p = 1 ∨ Nat.Prime p) ∧ n = p + a * a) := by
  intro h
  have h25 := h 25 (by decide)
  rcases h25 with ⟨a, p, ⟨hp, he⟩⟩
  have : p + a * a = 25 := by rw [he]
  -- Now we check all possible a from 0 to 5
  have : a ≤ 5 := by
    have : a * a ≤ 25 := by linarith
    omega
  interval_cases a
  · -- a = 0
    simp at he
    have : p = 25 := by linarith

    have : p = 21 := by linarith
    have : ¬ (Nat.Prime 21 ∨ 21 = 1) := by norm_num
    cases hp
    · linarith
    · exact this (hp this)
  · -- a = 3
    simp at he
    have : p = 16 := by linarith
    have : ¬ (Nat.Prime 16 ∨ 16 = 1) := by norm_num
    cases hp
    · linarith
    · exact this (hp this)
  · -- a = 4
    simp at he
    have : p = 9 := by linarith
    have : ¬ (Nat.Prime 9 ∨ 9 = 1) := by norm_num
    cases hp
    · linarith
    · exact this (hp this)
  · -- a = 5
    simp at he
    have : p = 0 := by linarith
    have : ¬ (0 = 1 ∨ Nat.Prime 0) := by norm_num
    cases hp
    · exact this (Or.inl ‹0 = 1›)
    · exact this (Or.inr (hp ‹p = 0›))
```
Note: This Lean code uses `interval_cases` to break into cases for `a` from 0 to 5. We need to show that for each `a`, `p` is neither 1 nor prime. Also, we need the fact that 25 is not prime (which is true). The actual Lean proof might require more detailed primality checks, but the idea is clear.

Output in normal language:
The conjecture that every positive integer can be expressed as \( p + a^2 \), where \( p \) is either prime or 1 and \( a \geq 0 \), is false. A counterexample is 25. For all nonnegative integers \( a \):
- If \( a = 0 \), \( 25 - 0 = 25 \) (not prime or 1).
- If \( a = 1 \), \( 25 - 1 = 24 \) (composite).
- If \( a = 2 \), \( 25 - 4 = 21 \) (composite).
- If \( a = 3 \), \( 25 - 9 = 16 \) (composite).
- If \( a = 4 \), \( 25 - 16 = 9 \) (composite).
- If \( a = 5 \), \( 25 - 25 = 0 \) (not prime or 1).
No value of \( a \) yields a valid \( p \). Therefore, 25 cannot be written in the required form.
