Here is a Lean 4 statement confirming that there are infinitely many primes of the form 6n + 5, followed by an explanation in normal language:

**Output in normal language:**

This proof follows the same method as Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes, adapted for primes of the form 6n + 5.

1. **Assume the contrary**: Suppose there are only finitely many primes of the form 6n + 5. Let M be the largest such prime.

2. **Construct a special number**: Consider N = 6×(M! + 1) - 1 = 6×M! + 5. This number is:
   - Clearly greater than 1
   - Congruent to 5 modulo 6 (since 6×M! ≡ 0 mod 6, so 6×M! + 5 ≡ 5 mod 6)

3. **Analyze prime factors**: Any prime factor p of N must satisfy p ≡ 1 or 5 mod 6 because:
   - Primes cannot be 2 or 3 (they would divide 6 but not N)
   - The only possible residues mod 6 are 0,1,2,3,4,5
   - Residues 0,2,3,4 are impossible for prime divisors of N

4. **Eliminate small primes**: For any prime p ≤ M:
   - If p ≡ 1 or 5 mod 6, then p divides M! (since p ≤ M)
   - Therefore p divides both 6×M! and 6×(M! + 1) - 1 = N
   - This would imply p divides 1 (the difference), which is impossible

5. **Find contradiction**: Therefore, N must have a prime factor p > M that is ≡ 5 mod 6. But this contradicts our assumption that M was the largest such prime.

Thus, our initial assumption was false, and there must be infinitely many primes of the form 6n + 5.

This proof works because numbers of the form 6n + 5 avoid being divisible by 2 and 3, forcing any prime factors to be of the forms we want, while the factorial construction ensures we get a prime larger than any we assumed existed.
