The Goldbach conjecture (every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes) is equivalent to the statement that every integer greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes.

**Proof:**

**(⇒) Assume Goldbach's conjecture holds.** Let m > 5 be any integer. We consider two cases:

1. **If m is even:** Then m-2 is even and greater than 2. By Goldbach's conjecture, m-2 = p+q where p and q are primes. Thus m = 2 + p + q, and since 2 is prime, m is the sum of three primes.

2. **If m is odd:** Then m-3 is even and greater than 2 (since m ≥ 7). By Goldbach's conjecture, m-3 = p+q where p and q are primes. Thus m = 3 + p + q, and since 3 is prime, m is the sum of three primes.

**(⇐) Assume every integer > 5 is the sum of three primes.** Let n be an even integer > 2. Then n+2 > 5, so by assumption, n+2 = p+q+r where p, q, r are primes. Since n+2 is even and the sum of three primes, at least one of these primes must be even (i.e., equal to 2), because the sum of three odd primes would be odd. Without loss of generality, suppose p=2. Then n = q + r, showing that n is the sum of two primes.

Thus the two statements are equivalent.

This proof shows that if we can represent all even numbers >2 as sums of two primes, then we can represent all numbers >5 as sums of three primes, and vice versa.
