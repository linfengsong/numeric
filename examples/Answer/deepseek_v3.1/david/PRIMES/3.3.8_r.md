I'll confirm these representations by listing all the ways each number can be written as the sum of two primes.

**For 60:**
1. 7 + 53 = 60 ✓
2. 13 + 47 = 60 ✓
3. 17 + 43 = 60 ✓
4. 19 + 41 = 60 ✓
5. 23 + 37 = 60 ✓
6. 29 + 31 = 60 ✓

**For 78:**
1. 5 + 73 = 78 ✓
2. 7 + 71 = 78 ✓
3. 11 + 67 = 78 ✓
4. 17 + 61 = 78 ✓
5. 19 + 59 = 78 ✓
6. 31 + 47 = 78 ✓
7. 37 + 41 = 78 ✓

**For 84:**
1. 5 + 79 = 84 ✓
2. 11 + 73 = 84 ✓
3. 13 + 71 = 84 ✓
4. 17 + 67 = 84 ✓
5. 23 + 61 = 84 ✓
6. 31 + 53 = 84 ✓
7. 37 + 47 = 84 ✓
8. 41 + 43 = 84 ✓

**Confirmation:**
- 60 can be written as the sum of two primes in **6** different ways ✓
- 78 can be written as the sum of two primes in **7** different ways ✓
- 84 can be written as the sum of two primes in **8** different ways ✓

All three numbers are even integers that satisfy the given conditions, demonstrating that for n = 6, 7, and 8, there exist even integers representable as the sum of two odd primes in exactly n different ways.
