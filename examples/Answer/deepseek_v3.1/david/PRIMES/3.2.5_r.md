### Step 1: Understand the Problem

We want to show that any composite three-digit number (i.e., from 100 to 999) has a prime factor ≤ 31.

### Step 2: Reasoning

Let \( n \) be a composite three-digit number. Then \( n \) has a factor \( d \) with \( 1 < d \leq \sqrt{n} \). Since \( n \leq 999 \), we have:
\[
\sqrt{n} \leq \sqrt{999} \approx 31.6
\]
So any factor \( d \) (which is at least 2) must be ≤ 31.6. But since \( d \) is an integer, \( d \leq 31 \). Now, \( d \) might not be prime, but it has a prime factor \( p \leq d \leq 31 \). Therefore, \( n \) has a prime factor \( p \leq 31 \).

### Step 3: Formal Proof in Lean

We'll state the theorem and then prove it.

```lean
theorem composite_three_digit_has_small_prime_factor (n : ℕ) (h : 100 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 999) (hcomp : ¬ Nat.Prime n) :
    ∃ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≤ 31 ∧ p ∣ n := by
  -- Since n is composite and positive (as n≥100), it has a factor d with 1 < d < n.
  have ⟨d, hd1, hd2⟩ := Nat.exists_prime_and_dvd hcomp (by linarith [h.left])
  have hd3 : d ≤ 31 := by
    have : d * d ≤ n := by
      exact?  -- Actually, we need to show that if d > sqrt(n) then n/d would be a smaller factor.
    -- Alternatively, we can use that the smallest prime factor is ≤ sqrt(n).
    -- But since sqrt(999) ≈ 31.6, and d is integer, d ≤ 31.
    exact Nat.le_sqrt.mp (by exact?)  -- This might not be directly available.
  -- Actually, we can do:
  have : d ≤ Nat.sqrt n := Nat.le_sqrt.2 (by omega)
  have : Nat.sqrt n ≤ 31 := by
    rw [Nat.le_sqrt]  -- Not exactly, we compute: since 31^2=961 ≤ 999, and 32^2=1024>999.
    norm_num
  exact ⟨d, hd1, by omega, hd2⟩
```

However, the above is a bit sketchy. Let's do it more carefully.

We know:
- \( d \) is a prime factor of \( n \), so \( d \mid n \) and \( d \leq n \).
- Since \( d \) is prime and \( n \) is composite, \( d \leq \sqrt{n} \) (because if \( d > \sqrt{n} \), then \( n/d < \sqrt{n} \) and would be a smaller factor, but we already took the smallest prime factor? Actually, we can use that the smallest prime factor \( p \) satisfies \( p \leq \sqrt{n} \)).

But in Lean, we can avoid that by noting that if \( d > 31 \), then since \( d \mid n \), we have \( n/d \leq n/32 \). But \( n \leq 999 \), so \( n/32 < 31.25 \), so \( n/d < 32 \). But then \( n/d \) has a prime factor \( q \leq 31 \), which also divides \( n \). So we are safe.

Actually, the simplest is to use:

```lean
theorem composite_three_digit_has_small_prime_factor (n : ℕ) (h : 100 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 999) (hcomp : ¬ Nat.Prime n) :
    ∃ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≤ 31 ∧ p ∣ n := by
  -- Get a prime factor p of n (which exists since n≥2)
  have ⟨p, hpp, hpdv⟩ := Nat.exists_prime_and_dvd hcomp (by linarith [h.left])
  have : p ≤ 31 := by
    by_contra! H  -- Assume p > 31, i.e., p ≥ 32
    -- Then since p is prime and p ∣ n, we have n ≥ p ≥ 32.
    -- But also, n has another factor q = n/p.
    have : n / p < p := by
      apply Nat.div_lt_self (by linarith) (by linarith)
    -- But then n/p must be 1 (since p is the smallest prime factor?) but wait, we didn't assume p is the smallest.
    -- Actually, we can show that if p > sqrt(n) then n/p < p, and if n/p had a prime factor, it would be smaller than p.
    -- Alternatively, since n ≤ 999 and p ≥ 32, then n/p ≤ 999/32 < 31.25, so any prime factor of n/p is ≤ 31.
    -- But we already have a prime factor p≥32, contradiction? Not exactly.

  -- Better: Since n is composite, it has a factor d with 1 < d ≤ sqrt(n).
  -- But sqrt(999) ≈ 31.6, so d ≤ 31.
  -- Then any prime factor of d is ≤ 31 and divides n.

  -- So we should instead not use `exists_prime_and_dvd` but get the smallest prime factor.

  -- Actually, we can use:
  have := Nat.minFac_prime hcomp (by linarith)
  let p := n.minFac
  have hpp : Nat.Prime p := this
  have hpdv : p ∣ n := Nat.minFac_dvd n
  have : p ≤ Nat.sqrt n := Nat.minFac_le_sqrt (by linarith)
  have : Nat.sqrt n ≤ 31 := by
    have : 31^2 = 961 ≤ 999 := by norm_num
    have : 32^2 = 1024 > 999 := by norm_num
    exact Nat.sqrt_le_sqrt (by linarith)
  exact ⟨p, hpp, by omega, hpdv⟩
```

This uses that the smallest prime factor `minFac` of `n` is ≤ √n.

### Step 4: Complete Lean Proof

We'll use `Nat.minFac`.

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Nat.Prime
import Mathlib.Tactic

theorem composite_three_digit_has_small_prime_factor (n : ℕ) (h : 100 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 999) (hcomp : ¬ Nat.Prime n) :
    ∃ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≤ 31 ∧ p ∣ n := by
  have hn : n ≠ 1 := by omega
  have hn' : 2 ≤ n := by omega
  let p := n.minFac
  have hprime : Nat.Prime p := Nat.minFac_prime hcomp hn
  have hdvd : p ∣ n := Nat.minFac_dvd n
  have hle : p ≤ Nat.sqrt n := Nat.minFac_le_sqrt hn'
  have sqrt_bound : Nat.sqrt n ≤ 31 := by
    have : n ≤ 999 := h.right
    have : 31 ^ 2 = 961 ≤ 999 := by norm_num
    have : 32 ^ 2 = 1024 > 999 := by norm_num
    exact Nat.le_sqrt.2 (by omega)
  have : p ≤ 31 := by omega
  exact ⟨p, hprime, this, hdvd⟩
```

### Step 5: Output in Normal Language

**Proof:**  
Let \( n \) be a composite three-digit number (so \( 100 \leq n \leq 999 \)). Since \( n \) is composite and greater than 1, it has a smallest prime factor \( p \). By properties of prime factors, \( p \leq \sqrt{n} \). Because \( n \leq 999 \), we have \( \sqrt{n} \leq \sqrt{999} \approx 31.6 \). Since \( p \) is an integer, \( p \leq 31 \). Therefore, \( n \) has a prime factor \( p \leq 31 \).  
∎

### Final Lean Statement

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Nat.Prime
import Mathlib.Tactic

theorem composite_three_digit_has_small_prime_factor (n : ℕ) (h : 100 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 999) (hcomp : ¬ Nat.Prime n) :
    ∃ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≤ 31 ∧ p ∣ n := by
  have hn : n ≠ 1 := by omega
  have hn' : 2 ≤ n := by omega
  have hprime : Nat.Prime (n.minFac) := Nat.minFac_prime hcomp hn
  have hdvd : n.minFac ∣ n := Nat.minFac_dvd n
  have hle : n.minFac ≤ Nat.sqrt n := Nat.minFac_le_sqrt hn'
  have sqrt_bound : Nat.sqrt n ≤ 31 := by
    have : n ≤ 999 := h.right
    have : 31 ^ 2 ≤ 999 := by norm_num
    have : 32 ^ 2 > 999 := by norm_num
    exact Nat.sqrt_le_sqrt (by omega)
  have : n.minFac ≤ 31 := by omega
  exact ⟨n.minFac, hprime, this, hdvd⟩
```

This completes the proof.
