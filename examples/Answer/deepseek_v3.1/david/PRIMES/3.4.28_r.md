Let's address each part step by step.

### (a) If \( n \geq 1 \), show that \( n! \) is never a perfect square.

**Proof:**
For \( n = 1 \): \( 1! = 1 \), which is \( 1^2 \), a perfect square. So the statement is false for \( n = 1 \). However, typically the statement is meant for \( n \geq 2 \). Let's assume \( n \geq 2 \).

For \( n \geq 2 \), consider the largest prime \( p \) such that \( p \leq n \). By Bertrand's Postulate (or Chebyshev's theorem), there is always a prime between \( n/2 \) and \( n \) for \( n > 1 \). So the largest prime \( p \) appears exactly once in the factorization of \( n! \) (since \( 2p > n \), so no multiple of \( p \) except \( p \) itself is \( \leq n \)). Therefore, the exponent of \( p \) in \( n! \) is 1. For \( n! \) to be a perfect square, every prime in its factorization must have an even exponent. Hence, \( n! \) cannot be a perfect square for \( n \geq 2 \).

But note: for \( n=1 \), \( 1! = 1 \) is a perfect square. So the correct statement should be: "For \( n \geq 2 \), \( n! \) is never a perfect square."

**Lean Statement:**
```lean
theorem factorial_not_square (n : ℕ) (h : n ≥ 2) : ¬ ∃ (k : ℕ), n! = k^2 := by
  intro hk
  rcases hk with ⟨k, hk⟩
  -- Use the fact that the largest prime ≤ n has exponent 1 in n!
  -- This requires more machinery in Lean, such as the existence of a prime in (n/2, n] and the uniqueness in factorization.
  -- Detailed proof in Lean would be longer, using `Nat.factorial` and `Nat.prime` properties.
  sorry  -- Placeholder for the full proof
```

**Output in normal language:**
For \( n \geq 2 \), \( n! \) is never a perfect square because the largest prime \( p \leq n \) appears exactly once (with exponent 1) in the prime factorization of \( n! \), which is odd. Since a perfect square requires all exponents to be even, \( n! \) cannot be a perfect square.

### (b) Find the values of \( n \geq 1 \) for which
\[
n! + (n+1)! + (n+2)!
\]
is a perfect square.

Simplify the expression:
\[
n! + (n+1)! + (n+2)! = n! \left[1 + (n+1) + (n+1)(n+2)\right] = n! \left[1 + n + 1 + (n+1)(n+2)\right]
\]
\[
= n! \left[n + 2 + (n+1)(n+2)\right] = n! (n+2) \left[1 + (n+1)\right] = n! (n+2)(n+2) = n! (n+2)^2
\]

So the expression simplifies to \( n! (n+2)^2 \).

We want this to be a perfect square, say \( k^2 \):
\[
n! (n+2)^2 = k^2 \implies n! = \left(\frac{k}{n+2}\right)^2
\]
So \( n! \) must be a perfect square. But from part (a), for \( n \geq 2 \), \( n! \) is never a perfect square. Therefore, we only need to check \( n = 1 \).

For \( n = 1 \):
\[
1! + 2! + 3! = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 = 3^2
\]
which is a perfect square.

For \( n = 0 \) (though \( n \geq 1 \) is required):
\[
0! + 1! + 2! = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 = 2^2
\]
but \( n \geq 1 \), so we don't consider.

Thus, the only value is \( n = 1 \).

**Lean Statement:**

**Output in normal language:**
The expression simplifies to \( n! (n+2)^2 \). For this to be a perfect square, \( n! \) must be a perfect square. However, for \( n \geq 2 \), \( n! \) is never a perfect square (as shown in part (a)). For \( n = 1 \), we get \( 1! \cdot 3^2 = 1 \cdot 9 = 9 = 3^2 \), which is a perfect square. Therefore, the only value is \( n = 1 \).

**Final answer:**
- (a) For \( n \geq 2 \), \( n! \) is never a perfect square.
- (b) The only value is \( n = 1 \).
