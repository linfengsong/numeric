Let's analyze the problem step by step:

We are to find all twin primes \(p\) and \(q = p + 2\) such that \(pq - 2\) is also prime.

Let \(p\) and \(p+2\) be twin primes. Then:
\[
pq - 2 = p(p+2) - 2 = p^2 + 2p - 2.
\]
We need \(p^2 + 2p - 2\) to be prime.

Let's test for small values of \(p\):

1. \(p = 3\), \(q = 5\):
   \(pq - 2 = 3 \cdot 5 - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13\), which is prime.

2. \(p = 5\), \(q = 7\):
   \(pq - 2 = 5 \cdot 7 - 2 = 35 - 2 = 33\), which is not prime (33 = 3 × 11).

3. \(p = 11\), \(q = 13\):
   \(pq - 2 = 11 \cdot 13 - 2 = 143 - 2 = 141\), which is not prime (141 = 3 × 47).

4. \(p = 17\), \(q = 19\):
   \(pq - 2 = 17 \cdot 19 - 2 = 323 - 2 = 321\), which is not prime (321 = 3 × 107).

5. \(p = 29\), \(q = 31\):
   \(pq - 2 = 29 \cdot 31 - 2 = 899 - 2 = 897\), which is not prime (897 = 3 × 299).

Notice a pattern: for \(p > 3\), \(pq - 2\) seems to be divisible by 3. Let's check:

Since \(p\) and \(p+2\) are primes greater than 3, they must be congruent to \(\pm 1 \pmod{6}\). Consider cases:

- If \(p \equiv 1 \pmod{6}\), then \(q = p+2 \equiv 3 \pmod{6}\), but \(q\) is prime and greater than 3, so it cannot be divisible by 3. So this case is impossible.
- Therefore, \(p \equiv 5 \pmod{6}\), and \(q = p+2 \equiv 1 \pmod{6}\).

So, \(p = 6k-1\), \(q = 6k+1\) for some integer \(k\).

Then:
\[
pq - 2 = (6k-1)(6k+1) - 2 = 36k^2 - 1 - 2 = 36k^2 - 3 = 3(12k^2 - 1).
\]
This is divisible by 3 and greater than 3 for \(k \geq 1\) (i.e., \(p \geq 5\)), so it is composite.

Therefore, the only possibility is when \(p = 3\), which we already found works.

Thus, the only twin primes satisfying the condition are \(p = 3\), \(q = 5\).

**Final Answer:**
The only twin primes \(p\) and \(q = p + 2\) for which \(pq - 2\) is prime are \(p = 3\) and \(q = 5\).

\[
\boxed{(p, q) = (3, 5)}
\]
