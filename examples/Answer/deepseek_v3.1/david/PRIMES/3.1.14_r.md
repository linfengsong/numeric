Let's find 15 pairs of consecutive primes \((p, q)\) such that \(q - p = 10\). We are to list these pairs.

We start by listing consecutive prime pairs with a gap of 10. Note that consecutive primes with a gap of 10 are not extremely rare, but we need 15 such pairs.

Here is a list (the first few are well-known, and we extend to find 15):

1. \(13 - 3 = 10\) â†’ (3, 13) but these are not consecutive primes (primes between: 5,7,11). So skip.
Actually, we need consecutive primes. So we look for primes \(p\) and \(q\) such that \(q = p + 10\) and there are no primes between \(p\) and \(q\).

Let's generate systematically:

We note that for \(q = p + 10\), the gap is 10. The first few pairs:

- (139, 149): 149 - 139 = 10, and no primes between.
- (181, 191): 191 - 181 = 10
- (241, 251): 251 - 241 = 10
- (283, 293): 293 - 283 = 10
- (337, 347): 347 - 337 = 10
- (409, 419): 419 - 409 = 10
- (421, 431): 431 - 421 = 10
- (547, 557): 557 - 547 = 10
- (577, 587): 587 - 577 = 10
- (631, 641): 641 - 631 = 10
- (691, 701): 701 - 691 = 10
- (709, 719): 719 - 709 = 10
- (787, 797): 797 - 787 = 10
- (811, 821): 821 - 811 = 10
- (829, 839): 839 - 829 = 10

We have 15 pairs above. Let's list them clearly:

1. 139 and 149
2. 181 and 191
3. 241 and 251
4. 283 and 293
5. 337 and 347
6. 409 and 419
7. 421 and 431
8. 547 and 557
9. 577 and 587
10. 631 and 641
11. 691 and 701
12. 709 and 719
13. 787 and 797
14. 811 and 821
15. 829 and 839

All these are consecutive primes with difference 10.

Thus, the integer 10 can be expressed as the difference of two consecutive primes in at least these 15 ways.

**Final Answer:**
The integer 10 can be expressed as the difference of two consecutive primes in the following 15 ways:
1. \(149 - 139 = 10\)
2. \(191 - 181 = 10\)
3. \(251 - 241 = 10\)
4. \(293 - 283 = 10\)
5. \(347 - 337 = 10\)
6. \(419 - 409 = 10\)
7. \(431 - 421 = 10\)
8. \(557 - 547 = 10\)
9. \(587 - 577 = 10\)
10. \(641 - 631 = 10\)
11. \(701 - 691 = 10\)
12. \(719 - 709 = 10\)
13. \(797 - 787 = 10\)
14. \(821 - 811 = 10\)
15. \(839 - 829 = 10\)

These are all pairs of consecutive primes with a difference of 10.
