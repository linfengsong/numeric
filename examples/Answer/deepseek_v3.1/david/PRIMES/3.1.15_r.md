### Step 1: Understand the Statement

We want to prove that a positive integer \( a > 1 \) is a perfect square if and only if, in its prime factorization (canonical form), every exponent is even.

---

### Step 2: Prime Factorization (Canonical Form)

Any integer \( a > 1 \) can be written uniquely as:
\[
a = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}
\]
where \( p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k \) are distinct primes and \( e_1, e_2, \dots, e_k \) are positive integers.

---

### Step 3: Proof of "If" Direction (All exponents even ⇒ \( a \) is a square)

Assume each exponent \( e_i \) is even. Write \( e_i = 2f_i \) for some integer \( f_i \geq 1 \). Then:
\[
a = p_1^{2f_1} p_2^{2f_2} \cdots p_k^{2f_k} = (p_1^{f_1} p_2^{f_2} \cdots p_k^{f_k})^2.
\]
So \( a \) is the square of the integer \( n = p_1^{f_1} p_2^{f_2} \cdots p_k^{f_k} \).

---

### Step 4: Proof of "Only If" Direction (\( a \) is a square ⇒ all exponents even)

Assume \( a \) is a perfect square, so \( a = n^2 \) for some integer \( n > 1 \). Write the prime factorization of \( n \):
\[
n = q_1^{g_1} q_2^{g_2} \cdots q_m^{g_m}.
\]
Then:
\[
a = n^2 = (q_1^{g_1} q_2^{g_2} \cdots q_m^{g_m})^2 = q_1^{2g_1} q_2^{2g_2} \cdots q_m^{2g_m}.
\]
This is the prime factorization of \( a \), and every exponent \( 2g_i \) is even.

---

### Step 5: ✅ Conclusion

We have shown both directions:
- If all exponents in the canonical form are even, then \( a \) is a square.
- If \( a \) is a square, then all exponents in its canonical form are even.

Therefore, \( a > 1 \) is a square **if and only if** all exponents in its prime factorization are even.

### Lean 4 Statement

    -- Then a = (∏ p in primes, p^(exponents p)) ^ 2
    -- This part requires more work in Lean to construct the square root.
    -- Alternatively, use that the factorization determines the number.
    -- We might use:
    --   have : a = (∏ p in (Nat.factorization a).support, p ^ (exponents p)) ^ 2
    -- But this is nontrivial to formalize.
    -- For the purpose of this query, we state the theorem and sketch the proof.
    sorry  -- Actual proof requires more Lean machinery.
```

**Note:** The Lean proof above is a sketch. Fully formalizing the "only if" direction requires more details (e.g., constructing the square root from the factorization). However, the logical structure is correct.

### Output in Normal Language

A positive integer \( a > 1 \) is a perfect square if and only if, in its prime factorization, every exponent is an even integer.

**Proof:**
- **If all exponents are even:** Write each exponent as \( 2f_i \). Then \( a = (p_1^{f_1} p_2^{f_2} \cdots p_k^{f_k})^2 \), so \( a \) is a square.
- **If \( a \) is a square:** Let \( a = n^2 \). The prime factorization of \( n^2 \) has each exponent twice that of \( n \), hence all exponents are even.

Thus, the equivalence holds.
