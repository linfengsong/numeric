I will prove this statement and then write a Lean theorem to formalize it.

**Proof:**

Let p ≥ 5 be a prime number. Since p is prime and p ≥ 5, p must be odd (as the only even prime is 2, which is less than 5).

We consider p modulo 3. By the division algorithm, p ≡ 0, 1, or 2 (mod 3).

- If p ≡ 0 (mod 3), then p would be divisible by 3. But p is prime ≥ 5, so p = 3. However, p ≥ 5, so this case is impossible.

- If p ≡ 1 (mod 3), then p² ≡ 1 (mod 3), so p² + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 ≡ 0 (mod 3). Thus 3 divides p² + 2.

- If p ≡ 2 (mod 3), then p² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3), so p² + 2 ≡ 1 + 2 ≡ 0 (mod 3). Thus 3 divides p² + 2.

In both remaining cases, 3 divides p² + 2. Since p ≥ 5, we have p² + 2 ≥ 27, so 3 is a proper divisor (1 < 3 < p² + 2). Therefore, p² + 2 is composite.

**Lean formalization:**

      rw [Nat.mod_eq_zero_of_dvd]
      use (p^2 / 3 + 1)
      have : p^2 + 2 = 3 * (p^2 / 3 + 1) := by
        linarith [Nat.div_add_mod p^2 3]
      linarith
    · -- Case p ≡ 2 mod 3: p^2 ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3, so p^2 + 2 ≡ 0 mod 3
      have : p^2 % 3 = 1 := by
        rw [Nat.pow_mod, show (2:ℕ)^2 = 4 by norm_num, show (4:ℕ) % 3 = 1 by norm_num]
      rw [Nat.mod_eq_zero_of_dvd]
      use (p^2 / 3 + 1)
      have : p^2 + 2 = 3 * (p^2 / 3 + 1) := by
        linarith [Nat.div_add_mod p^2 3]
      linarith
  
  -- Since p ≥ 5, p^2 + 2 ≥ 27 > 3, so 3 is a proper divisor
  have size : p^2 + 2 > 3 := by
    have : p ≥ 5 := h
    nlinarith
  
  -- Therefore p^2 + 2 is not prime
  exact Nat.not_prime_mul (by norm_num) (by norm_num) h3
```

**Normal language output:**

If p is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, then p² + 2 is always divisible by 3. Since p ≥ 5, we have p² + 2 ≥ 27, making 3 a proper divisor (not 1 or the number itself). Therefore, p² + 2 must be a composite number.
