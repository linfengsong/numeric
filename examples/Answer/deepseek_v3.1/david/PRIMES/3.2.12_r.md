I will prove each statement step by step.

### (a) Prove that \( p_n > 2^n - 1 \) for \( n \geq 5 \)

**Proof:**
We proceed by induction.

**Base case (n=5):**
The 5th prime is \( p_5 = 11 \). Then \( 2^5 - 1 = 31 \), and indeed \( 11 > 31 \) is false. Wait, this seems problematic.

Wait, let me check: For n=5, \( 2^5 - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31 \), and \( p_5 = 11 \). But \( 11 > 31 \) is false. So the statement as written might be incorrect.

Perhaps it should be \( p_n < 2^n - 1 \)? But the statement says \( p_n > 2^n - 1 \).

Let me verify with n=6: \( p_6 = 13 \), \( 2^6 - 1 = 63 \), \( 13 > 63 \) false.
n=7: \( p_7 = 17 \), \( 2^7 - 1 = 127 \), false.
n=8: \( p_8 = 19 \), \( 2^8 - 1 = 255 \), false.

This suggests the inequality might be reversed. Actually, there is a known result that \( p_n < 2^n \) for \( n \geq 1 \), but here it's \( 2^n - 1 \).

Perhaps it's a typo and it should be \( p_n < 2^n \). But the statement clearly says \( p_n > 2^n - 1 \).

Wait, for n=1: \( p_1=2 \), \( 2^1-1=1 \), \( 2>1 \) true.
n=2: \( p_2=3 \), \( 2^2-1=3 \), \( 3>3 \) false.
n=3: \( p_3=5 \), \( 2^3-1=7 \), \( 5>7 \) false.
n=4: \( p_4=7 \), \( 2^4-1=15 \), \( 7>15 \) false.

So the inequality fails for n=2,3,4,5,... So it can't be correct as stated.

Perhaps it is \( p_n \geq 2^n - 1 \) for n>=5? But n=5: 11 >= 31 false.

I suspect the intended statement is \( p_n < 2^n \) for n>=1, which is true.

But since the problem says "establish", and it's given as is, I should prove it if true or disprove.

Given that it fails for n=2,3,4,5,..., it is false. So perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, maybe it's \( p_n > 2n - 1 \) or something else.

Given the context, I think there might be a typo. Actually, there is a known result: \( p_n > n \ln n \), and for large n, \( 2^n - 1 \) is much larger.

So I will assume that the statement is actually \( p_n < 2^n - 1 \) for n>=5.

But for n=5: 11 < 31 true.
n=6: 13 < 63 true.
And it is known that \( p_n < 2^n \).

So I will prove \( p_n < 2^n \) for n>=1, which implies \( p_n < 2^n - 1 \) for n>=2 since \( 2^n - 1 < 2^n \).

But to be precise, let's prove \( p_n < 2^n \).

**Proof of \( p_n < 2^n \) for n>=1 by induction:**
Base: n=1, p1=2 < 2^1=2. Actually 2<2 is false, so n=1 is equality.
n=2: p2=3 < 4 true.
Assume for all k<=n, p_k < 2^k.
Consider n+1. By Bertrand's Postulate, there is a prime between n and 2n, so p_{n+1} < 2p_n < 2 * 2^n = 2^{n+1}.
So by induction, p_n < 2^n for n>=2.

Then for n>=5, since 2^n - 1 < 2^n, we have p_n < 2^n - 1? Not necessarily, because p_n < 2^n, but could be greater than 2^n -1.
For n=5: 11 < 31 true.
n=6:13<63 true.
So it holds.

But to prove directly \( p_n < 2^n -1 \) for n>=5.

Since p_n < 2^n, and for n>=5, 2^n -1 > 2^{n-1} *2 -1 = 2^n -1, and since p_n >=11 for n>=5, and 2^n -1 grows faster, it holds.

But given the initial statement is \( p_n > 2^n -1 \), which is false, I think it's a typo.

Given the other parts are non-trivial, I will assume the intended is \( p_n < 2^n -1 \) for n>=5.

But to honor the problem, I will prove the given as is if possible, but it's false.

Perhaps it's \( p_n > 2n -1 \) or something.

After checking, I think it's likely \( p_n < 2^n \), but since it's written as is, I will disprove it.

For part (a), the statement is false. For n=5, p5=11, 2^5-1=31, 11>31 is false.

So I will state that.

**For (a):** The statement is false. Counterexample: n=5, p5=11, 2^5 -1=31, and 11 > 31 is false.

### (b) None of the integers \( P_n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1 \) is a perfect square.

**Proof:**
Assume for contradiction that for some n, \( P_n = k^2 \) for some integer k.

Note that \( P_n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1 \).

For n=1: P1=2+1=3, not a square.
n=2: 2*3+1=7, not a square.
n=3: 2*3*5+1=31, not.
n=4: 2*3*5*7+1=211, not.
So for small n, it holds.

Now, suppose \( P_n = k^2 \).
Then \( k^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{p_i} \) for each prime p_i dividing the product.
So \( p_i \) divides \( k^2 - 1 = (k-1)(k+1) \).

Since \( P_n > p_n \), and it is odd for n>=2, k is odd.

Now, consider modulo 4. For n>=2, P_n is odd, so k is odd.
Also, for n>=3, P_n mod4: the product is 2*3*5*... all odd primes except 2, so product is even times odd = even, so even+1= odd, and mod4: the product is 2*(odd) =2 mod4? Actually, for n>=2, product has 2, so even, and even mod4 can be 2 or 0. But +1 gives 3 or 1 mod4.
But a square mod4 is only 0 or 1. So possible.

Now, suppose \( P_n = k^2 \).
Then \( k^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{p_i} \) for each i, so \( p_i \) divides either k-1 or k+1.

But since the primes are all distinct, and k is between, it's hard.

Another approach: For n>=3, P_n mod3: product has 3, so product is divisible by 3, so P_n = 0+1=1 mod3, and squares mod3 are 0 or 1, so possible.

Better: Consider that P_n is coprime to all primes up to p_n, so if it is a square, its prime factors are all greater than p_n.
So let q be the smallest prime factor of k. Then q > p_n.
But then \( k^2 >= q^2 > p_n^2 \), and P_n = p1...pn +1 < (p_n)^n approximately, so for large n, contradiction.

But not rigorous.

Actually, we can show that P_n is not a square by considering it modulo one of the primes.

A known result: Euclid numbers are not square.

Standard proof: Assume P_n = k^2.
For n>=3, P_n ≡ 1 mod3, so k≡1 or2 mod3.
Also, P_n ≡ 1 mod4 for n>=3? Product is even, so 2 mod4? 2*3*5=30≡2 mod4, +1=3 mod4, and square mod4 is not3. So for n>=3, P_n ≡3 mod4, but a square is only 0 or1 mod4. Contradiction.

For n=3: 31≡3 mod4, not square.
n=4: 211≡3 mod4.
n=5: 2311≡2311 mod4: 2308 divisible by4, so 2311=2308+3≡3 mod4.
In general, for n>=3, the product p1..pn includes2 and at least one odd prime, so product is2 mod4? Actually,2 times odd is2 mod4, so product≡2 mod4, then +1=3 mod4.
And no square is3 mod4. So for all n>=3, P_n ≡3 mod4, hence not a square.

For n=1: P1=3≡3 mod4, not square.
n=2: P2=7≡3 mod4, not square.

So for all n>=1, P_n ≡3 mod4, and since squares are0 or1 mod4, it is never a square.

**Therefore, none of the P_n is a perfect square.**

### (c) The sum \( \frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{p_n} \) is never an integer.

**Proof:**
Let S = sum_{i=1}^n 1/p_i.
Assume S is an integer.

Multiply by M = p1 p2 ... p_n, the product of all primes.
Then M * S = sum_{i=1}^n (M / p_i) = integer.

Each term M/p_i is an integer, and is divisible by all primes except p_i.

In particular, for each i, M/p_i is not divisible by p_i.

Now, consider the term for i=1: M/p1 is not divisible by p1.
Similarly for others.

Now, if S is an integer, say K, then M * K = sum_{i} M/p_i.

Now, look modulo p1. 
M ≡0 mod p1.
Each M/p_j for j≠1 is divisible by p1? Since M has p1, and for j≠1, M/p_j has p1.
So for j≠1, M/p_j ≡0 mod p1.
But M/p1 is not divisible by p1, so M/p1 ≡ a (not0) mod p1.
So the sum ≡ a mod p1, not0.
But left side M*K ≡0 mod p1.
Contradiction.

Therefore, S cannot be an integer.

**Thus, the sum is never an integer.**

### Summary of proofs:
(a) The statement \( p_n > 2^n - 1 \) for \( n \geq 5 \) is false. Counterexample: n=5, p5=11, 2^5-1=31, and 11>31 is false.
(b) For all n, \( P_n \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \), and since no square is 3 mod4, it is never a perfect square.
(c) If the sum were integer, multiplying by the product leads to a contradiction modulo any prime.

### Lean Statement (for parts b and c, since a is false):

For (b):
```lean
theorem no_square : ∀ (n : ℕ), ¬ (∃ (k : ℕ), (primorial n + 1) = k^2) := by
  intro n
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨k, hk⟩
  have : primorial n + 1 ≡ 3 [MOD 4] := by ...  -- proof that it's 3 mod4
  have : k^2 ≢ 3 [MOD 4] := by ...            -- squares are 0 or1 mod4
  contradiction
```

For (c):
```lean
theorem sum_recip_primes_not_int : ∀ (n : ℕ), ¬ (∃ (k : ℕ), (∑ i in finset.range n, 1/(nth_prime i)) = k) := by
  intro n
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨k, hk⟩
  let M := ∏ i in finset.range n, nth_prime i
  have : M * (∑ i, 1/(nth_prime i)) = ∑ i, M / (nth_prime i) := ...
  have : M * k = ∑ i, M / (nth_prime i) := by rw [hk]
  -- Now modulo (nth_prime 0) say p0
  have : M ≡ 0 [MOD p0] := ...
  have : M * k ≡ 0 [MOD p0] := ...
  have : For i≠0, M/(nth_prime i) ≡ 0 [MOD p0] := ...
  have : M/(nth_prime 0) ≡ some non-zero [MOD p0] := ...
  so sum ≡ non-zero mod p0, contradiction.
```

### Output in normal language:
(a) The inequality \( p_n > 2^n - 1 \) for \( n \geq 5 \) is not true. For example, when n=5, the fifth prime is 11 and \( 2^5 - 1 = 31 \), and 11 is not greater than 31.
(b) None of the numbers \( P_n = p_1p_2\cdots p_n + 1 \) is a perfect square because each such number leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, and no perfect square can have that property.
(c) The sum of the reciprocals of the first n primes can never be an integer because if it were, multiplying through by the product of those primes would lead to a contradiction modulo any one of the primes.
