Let's confirm the conjecture for the first five values of \( n \). The conjecture states that for \( P_n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1 \), and \( q_n \) being the smallest prime strictly greater than \( P_n \), the difference \( q_n - (p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n) \) is always prime.

We'll compute for \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \).

### Step 1: Define the first \( n \) primes
Let \( p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3, p_3 = 5, p_4 = 7, p_5 = 11 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( P_n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1 \)
- \( n = 1 \): \( P_1 = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
- \( n = 2 \): \( P_2 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 \)
- \( n = 3 \): \( P_3 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31 \)
- \( n = 4 \): \( P_4 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 + 1 = 210 + 1 = 211 \)
- \( n = 5 \): \( P_5 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 + 1 = 2310 + 1 = 2311 \)

### Step 3: Find \( q_n \), the smallest prime strictly greater than \( P_n \)
- \( n = 1 \): \( P_1 = 3 \). Next prime is 5. So \( q_1 = 5 \).
- \( n = 2 \): \( P_2 = 7 \). Next prime is 11. So \( q_2 = 11 \).
- \( n = 3 \): \( P_3 = 31 \). Next prime is 37. So \( q_3 = 37 \).
- \( n = 4 \): \( P_4 = 211 \). Next prime is 223. So \( q_4 = 223 \).
- \( n = 5 \): \( P_5 = 2311 \). Next prime is 2333. So \( q_5 = 2333 \).

### Step 4: Compute the difference \( d_n = q_n - (p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n) \)
Note: \( p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n = P_n - 1 \).

So \( d_n = q_n - (P_n - 1) = q_n - P_n + 1 \).

Alternatively, we can compute directly:
- \( n = 1 \): \( d_1 = 5 - (2) = 3 \)
- \( n = 2 \): \( d_2 = 11 - (2 \cdot 3) = 11 - 6 = 5 \)
- \( n = 3 \): \( d_3 = 37 - (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5) = 37 - 30 = 7 \)
- \( n = 4 \): \( d_4 = 223 - (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7) = 223 - 210 = 13 \)
- \( n = 5 \): \( d_5 = 2333 - (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11) = 2333 - 2310 = 23 \)

### Step 5: Check if \( d_n \) is prime
- \( d_1 = 3 \) is prime.
- \( d_2 = 5 \) is prime.
- \( d_3 = 7 \) is prime.
- \( d_4 = 13 \) is prime.
- \( d_5 = 23 \) is prime.

All differences are prime.

### Lean Statement:
In Lean, we can define the primorial and then compute the values. However, since the question asks to confirm for the first five values, we can state:

```lean
-- Define the primorial function if needed, but for confirmation we can compute manually.
-- The conjecture holds for n=1 to 5: the differences are 3, 5, 7, 13, 23, all prime.
```

### Output in Normal Language:
For the first five values of \( n \):
- When \( n = 1 \), \( P_1 = 3 \), \( q_1 = 5 \), and the difference \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) is prime.
- When \( n = 2 \), \( P_2 = 7 \), \( q_2 = 11 \), and the difference \( 11 - 6 = 5 \) is prime.
- When \( n = 3 \), \( P_3 = 31 \), \( q_3 = 37 \), and the difference \( 37 - 30 = 7 \) is prime.
- When \( n = 4 \), \( P_4 = 211 \), \( q_4 = 223 \), and the difference \( 223 - 210 = 13 \) is prime.
- When \( n = 5 \), \( P_5 = 2311 \), \( q_5 = 2333 \), and the difference \( 2333 - 2310 = 23 \) is prime.

Thus, the conjecture is confirmed for the first five values of \( n \).
