Let \( n > 1 \). We want to show that every prime divisor \( p \) of \( n! + 1 \) is an odd integer greater than \( n \).

**Step 1: Show that \( p > n \):**
Suppose \( p \) is a prime divisor of \( n! + 1 \). Then \( n! + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \), so \( n! \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \).
If \( p \leq n \), then \( p \) divides \( n! \) (since \( n! \) is the product of all integers from 1 to \( n \), and \( p \) is one of them). But then \( n! \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \), which contradicts \( n! \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \). Therefore, \( p \) cannot be \( \leq n \), so \( p > n \).

**Step 2: Show that \( p \) is odd:**
If \( p = 2 \), then \( n! + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \). But for \( n > 1 \), \( n! \) is even (since it includes 2), so \( n! + 1 \) is odd. Thus \( n! + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \), not 0. So \( p \) cannot be 2. Therefore, \( p \) is odd.

**Conclusion:**
Every prime divisor \( p \) of \( n! + 1 \) (for \( n > 1 \)) is an odd integer greater than \( n \).

**Explanation of Lean Code:**
1. We assume `n > 1` and let `p` be a prime dividing `n! + 1`.
2. For `p > n`: by contradiction, if `p ≤ n`, then `p` divides `n!` (since `p` is prime and ≤ n). Then `p` divides `(n! + 1) - n! = 1`, which is impossible.
3. For `p` odd: if `p = 2`, then `2 ∣ n! + 1`. But `n!` is even (for `n > 1`), so `n! + 1` is odd, contradiction. So `p ≠ 2`, and since `p` is prime, it must be odd (so `p % 2 = 1`).

This proves the result in Lean.
