I'll solve this using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers between 100 and 200.

**Step 1:** Create a list of numbers from 100 to 200
**Step 2:** Start with the smallest prime (2) and eliminate its multiples, but since we're only looking at numbers ≥100, we'll start with primes ≤√200 ≈ 14.14

**Primes ≤14:** 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13

**Eliminate multiples:**
- Multiples of 2: 100, 102, 104, ..., 200
- Multiples of 3: 102, 105, 108, ..., 198
- Multiples of 5: 100, 105, 110, ..., 200
- Multiples of 7: 105, 112, 119, ..., 196
- Multiples of 11: 110, 121, 132, ..., 198
- Multiples of 13: 104, 117, 130, ..., 195

**Remaining primes between 100 and 200:**
101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199

**Verification:** Let me confirm a few:
- 101: not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13 ✓
- 103: not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13 ✓
- 107: not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13 ✓
- 109: not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13 ✓

**Final Answer:** The prime numbers between 100 and 200 are: 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199

There are 21 prime numbers in this range.
