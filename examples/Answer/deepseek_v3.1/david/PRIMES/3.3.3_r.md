Let's find all pairs of primes \((p, q)\) such that \(p - q = 3\).

We are looking for primes \(p\) and \(q\) with \(p = q + 3\). Since \(p\) and \(q\) are primes, and \(p > q\) (because \(p - q = 3 > 0\)), we can iterate over small primes for \(q\) and check if \(q + 3\) is also prime.

List of primes (starting from the smallest):
- \(q = 2\): then \(p = 2 + 3 = 5\), which is prime. So \((p, q) = (5, 2)\) is a solution.
- \(q = 3\): then \(p = 3 + 3 = 6\), which is not prime.
- \(q = 5\): then \(p = 5 + 3 = 8\), which is not prime.
- \(q = 7\): then \(p = 7 + 3 = 10\), not prime.
- \(q = 11\): then \(p = 11 + 3 = 14\), not prime.
- \(q = 13\): then \(p = 13 + 3 = 16\), not prime.
- \(q = 17\): then \(p = 17 + 3 = 20\), not prime.
- \(q = 19\): then \(p = 19 + 3 = 22\), not prime.
- \(q = 23\): then \(p = 23 + 3 = 26\), not prime.
- \(q = 29\): then \(p = 29 + 3 = 32\), not prime.
- \(q = 31\): then \(p = 31 + 3 = 34\), not prime.
- \(q = 37\): then \(p = 37 + 3 = 40\), not prime.
- \(q = 41\): then \(p = 41 + 3 = 44\), not prime.
- \(q = 43\): then \(p = 43 + 3 = 46\), not prime.
- \(q = 47\): then \(p = 47 + 3 = 50\), not prime.
- \(q = 53\): then \(p = 53 + 3 = 56\), not prime.
- \(q = 59\): then \(p = 59 + 3 = 62\), not prime.
- \(q = 61\): then \(p = 61 + 3 = 64\), not prime.
- \(q = 67\): then \(p = 67 + 3 = 70\), not prime.
- \(q = 71\): then \(p = 71 + 3 = 74\), not prime.
- \(q = 73\): then \(p = 73 + 3 = 76\), not prime.
- \(q = 79\): then \(p = 79 + 3 = 82\), not prime.
- \(q = 83\): then \(p = 83 + 3 = 86\), not prime.
- \(q = 89\): then \(p = 89 + 3 = 92\), not prime.
- \(q = 97\): then \(p = 97 + 3 = 100\), not prime.

It seems that beyond \(q=2\), no other primes yield \(q+3\) prime. However, note that if \(q\) is an odd prime (greater than 2), then \(q\) is odd, so \(q + 3\) is even (since odd + odd = even). The only even prime is 2, so \(q + 3\) can only be prime if \(q + 3 = 2\), which implies \(q = -1\), not prime. Therefore, the only possibility is when \(q = 2\) (the only even prime), which gives \(p = 5\).

Thus, the only pair is \((p, q) = (5, 2)\).

**Lean Statement:**
```lean
example : ∃ (p q : ℕ), nat.prime p ∧ nat.prime q ∧ p - q = 3 :=
⟨5, 2, by norm_num [nat.prime], by norm_num [nat.prime], by norm_num⟩
```

**Output in Normal Language:**
The only pair of primes \((p, q)\) satisfying \(p - q = 3\) is \(p = 5\) and \(q = 2\).
