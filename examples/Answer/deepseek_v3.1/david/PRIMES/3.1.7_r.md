Let's find all prime numbers that divide \(50!\) (50 factorial).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
Since \(50! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times \cdots \times 50\), any prime number \(p\) that is less than or equal to 50 will divide \(50!\) because \(p\) appears as a factor in the product. Conversely, if a prime \(p > 50\), it cannot divide \(50!\) because none of the factors from 1 to 50 is divisible by \(p\).

**Step 2: List All Primes ≤ 50**
The prime numbers less than or equal to 50 are:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.

**Step 3: Confirm That Each Prime Divides 50!**
For each prime \(p\) in the list above, since \(p \leq 50\), it is one of the factors in \(50!\). Therefore, \(50!\) is divisible by \(p\).

**Step 4: Conclusion**
The prime numbers that divide \(50!\) are exactly the primes less than or equal to 50.

**Final Answer:**
The prime numbers that divide \(50!\) are:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.

There are 15 such primes.

**Lean Statement (for verification):**
In Lean, we can state that for any prime \(p\), \(p \mid 50!\) if and only if \(p \leq 50\). However, since Lean requires precise definitions, we might express it as:
```lean
theorem primes_dividing_50_factorial (p : ℕ) [hp : Fact p.Prime] : p ∣ 50! ↔ p ≤ 50 := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    contrapose! h
    exact Nat.Prime.dvd_factorial_ne hp.1 h
  · intro h
    exact Nat.dvd_factorial (Nat.Prime.pos hp.1) h
```
This theorem says that a prime \(p\) divides \(50!\) if and only if \(p \leq 50\). The list of primes \(\leq 50\) can be generated separately.

**Output in Normal Language:**
All prime numbers that are less than or equal to 50 divide 50 factorial. These primes are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47.
