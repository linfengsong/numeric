### (a) Proof: An integer \( n > 1 \) is square-free if and only if \( n \) can be factored into a product of distinct primes.

#### (⇒) Suppose \( n \) is square-free. Then by definition, it is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1. Consider the prime factorization of \( n \):
\[
n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}
\]
If any exponent \( a_i \geq 2 \), then \( p_i^2 \mid n \), contradicting that \( n \) is square-free. Hence, each \( a_i = 1 \), so \( n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k \) is a product of distinct primes.

#### (⇐) Suppose \( n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k \) with distinct primes. Then for any integer \( m > 1 \), if \( m^2 \mid n \), then some prime \( p \mid m \) must have \( p^2 \mid n \), but each prime appears only once, contradiction. Hence, \( n \) is square-free.

### (b) Proof: Every integer \( n > 1 \) is the product of a square-free integer and a perfect square.

Let \( n > 1 \) have prime factorization:
\[
n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}
\]
For each exponent \( a_i \), write \( a_i = 2b_i + r_i \) with \( r_i \in \{0,1\} \) (i.e., separate into even and odd parts). Then:
\[
n = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{2b_i + r_i} = \left( \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{b_i} \right)^2 \cdot \left( \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{r_i} \right)
\]
Let \( s = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{b_i} \) (a perfect square) and \( m = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{r_i} \). Since each \( r_i \) is 0 or 1, \( m \) is square-free. Thus, \( n = s^2 \cdot m \), as required.

### Output in Normal Language:
- (a) An integer \( n > 1 \) is square-free exactly when its prime factorization has no repeated primes, i.e., it is a product of distinct primes.
- (b) For any integer \( n > 1 \), we can write \( n = m \cdot s^2 \), where \( m \) is square-free and \( s \) is an integer (so \( s^2 \) is a perfect square). This is achieved by separating the exponents in the prime factorization into even and odd parts.
