### Proof Explanation

**Theorem Statement**: For any integer n > 2, there exists a prime number p such that n < p < n!.

**Proof Strategy**:
1. Consider the number m = n! - 1
2. Since n > 2, we have n! > 2, so m ≥ 1
3. Every integer greater than 1 has at least one prime divisor, so m has a prime factor p
4. Show that p must be greater than n:
   - If p ≤ n, then p would divide n! (since n! contains all numbers ≤ n)
   - But p also divides m = n! - 1
   - Therefore p would divide (n! - (n! - 1)) = 1, which is impossible for a prime
5. Since p divides m = n! - 1, we have p ≤ m < n!
6. Therefore n < p < n!

**Key Observations**:
- The proof uses the number n! - 1 as a constructive way to find the prime
- The argument relies on the fact that no prime ≤ n can divide both n! and n! - 1 simultaneously
- This establishes the existence of at least one prime between n and n! for all n > 2

The proof is constructive in the sense that it shows how to find such a prime (as a divisor of n! - 1), though it doesn't provide an efficient method for actually computing it.
