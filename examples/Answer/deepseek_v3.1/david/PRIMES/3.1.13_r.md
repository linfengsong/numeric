### Natural Language Explanation:

**Theorem**: If n > 1 is an integer not of the form 6k + 3, then n² + 2ⁿ is composite.

**Proof Strategy**: Since n is not of the form 6k + 3, it must be congruent to 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5 modulo 6. We analyze each case:

1. **n ≡ 0 mod 6**: n is even, so both n² and 2ⁿ are even ⇒ n² + 2ⁿ is even and >2 ⇒ composite.

2. **n ≡ 1 mod 6**: n ≡ 1 mod 3 ⇒ n² ≡ 1 mod 3. Also 2ⁿ ≡ 2 mod 3 (by induction). Thus n² + 2ⁿ ≡ 0 mod 3 ⇒ divisible by 3 and >3 ⇒ composite.

3. **n ≡ 2 mod 6**: n is even ⇒ both n² and 2ⁿ are even ⇒ n² + 2ⁿ is even and >2 ⇒ composite.

4. **n ≡ 4 mod 6**: n is even ⇒ both n² and 2ⁿ are even ⇒ n² + 2ⁿ is even and >2 ⇒ composite.

5. **n ≡ 5 mod 6**: n ≡ 2 mod 3 ⇒ n² ≡ 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Also 2ⁿ ≡ 2 mod 3 ⇒ n² + 2ⁿ ≡ 0 mod 3 ⇒ divisible by 3 and >3 ⇒ composite.

In all cases, we find a proper divisor (2 or 3) showing that n² + 2ⁿ cannot be prime, hence it must be composite.

The Lean proof formalizes this case analysis, showing for each residue class modulo 6 that n² + 2ⁿ has a non-trivial divisor.
