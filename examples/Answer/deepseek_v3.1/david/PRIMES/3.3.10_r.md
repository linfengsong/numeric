I'll prove this statement and then provide a Lean 4 formalization.

**Proof:**

Let n > 2 be an integer. Consider the sequence:
$$(n + 1)! - 2, (n + 1)! - 3, ..., (n + 1)! - (n + 1)$$

This sequence contains n terms. For each integer k where 2 ≤ k ≤ n + 1:

1. $(n + 1)! - k$ is clearly greater than 1 since $(n + 1)! ≥ 6$ for n > 2

2. $(n + 1)! - k$ is divisible by k because:
   $$(n + 1)! ≡ 0 \pmod{k} \quad \text{(since k ≤ n + 1)}$$
   $$(n + 1)! - k ≡ -k ≡ 0 \pmod{k}$$

3. Since k ≥ 2 and $(n + 1)! - k > k$ (for n > 2), this means $(n + 1)! - k$ has a proper divisor k, making it composite.

Therefore, all n numbers in this sequence are composite integers.

**Lean 4 Formalization:**

      _ ≥ 6 - 4 := Nat.sub_le_sub_left (by omega)
      _ = 2 := by norm_num
      _ ≥ k := by omega

  exact ⟨k, ((n + 1)! - k) / k, by rw [Nat.div_add_mod ((n + 1)! - k) k, Nat.mod_eq_zero_of_dvd hdiv]⟩
```

**Output in normal language:**

The sequence $(n + 1)! - 2, (n + 1)! - 3, ..., (n + 1)! - (n + 1)$ indeed produces n consecutive composite integers for any integer n > 2.

For each term $(n + 1)! - k$ where 2 ≤ k ≤ n + 1:
- The number is greater than 1
- It is divisible by k (since k ≤ n + 1 and thus divides (n + 1)!)
- It is greater than k (making k a proper divisor)
- Therefore, it must be composite

This construction provides a method to generate arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive composite numbers by choosing sufficiently large values of n.
