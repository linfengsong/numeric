Let's address each part of the problem step by step.

### (a) Find four more primes that are 1 less than a power of 2.

Primes of the form \( p = 2^k - 1 \) are known as Mersenne primes. We already know \( 3 = 2^2 - 1 \). Here are four more:

1. \( k = 3 \): \( 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \) (prime)
2. \( k = 5 \): \( 2^5 - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31 \) (prime)
3. \( k = 7 \): \( 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127 \) (prime)
4. \( k = 13 \): \( 2^{13} - 1 = 8192 - 1 = 8191 \) (prime)

So the four primes are: 7, 31, 127, 8191.

### (b) If \( p = 2^k - 1 \) is prime, show that \( k \) is an odd integer, except when \( k = 2 \).

We need to show that if \( k \) is even and greater than 2, then \( 2^k - 1 \) is composite.

Let \( k = 2m \) (with \( m > 1 \), since \( k > 2 \)). Then:
\[
2^k - 1 = 2^{2m} - 1 = (2^m - 1)(2^m + 1)
\]
Since \( m > 1 \), both \( 2^m - 1 \) and \( 2^m + 1 \) are integers greater than 1. Therefore, \( 2^k - 1 \) factors nontrivially and is composite.

The only exception is \( k = 2 \), which is even, but \( 2^2 - 1 = 3 \) is prime. For any even \( k > 2 \), \( 2^k - 1 \) is composite.

Hence, if \( p = 2^k - 1 \) is prime, then \( k \) must be odd (except for \( k = 2 \)).

### Lean Statement

In Lean, we can state and prove this as follows:

```lean
import data.nat.prime
import tactic

lemma k_odd_for_mersenne_prime (k : ℕ) (hp : nat.prime (2^k - 1)) (hk : k > 2) : odd k :=
begin
  by_contra h,
  rw [odd_iff_not_even, not_not] at h,
  have hk' : k ≥ 2 := by linarith,
  rcases exists_eq_succ_of_ne_zero (nat.sub_ne_zero_of_lt hk') with ⟨m, hm⟩,
  have hfactor : 2^k - 1 = (2^m - 1) * (2^m + 1),
  { calc 2^k - 1 = 2^(2*m) - 1 : by rw hm
           ... = (2^m)^2 - 1 : by ring
           ... = (2^m - 1) * (2^m + 1) : by ring },
  have h1 : 1 < 2^m - 1,
  { apply nat.sub_one_lt_iff.mpr,
    exact nat.one_lt_pow m 2 (by linarith [nat.one_le_of_lt hk']) },
  have h2 : 1 < 2^m + 1,
  { linarith [nat.one_le_pow m 2] },
  have : ¬ nat.prime (2^k - 1),
  { exact nat.not_prime_mul h1 h2 hfactor },
  contradiction,
end
```

This Lean proof shows that for \( k > 2 \), if \( 2^k - 1 \) is prime, then \( k \) is odd. The exception \( k = 2 \) is handled by the condition \( k > 2 \).

### Output in Normal Language

(a) Four more primes of the form \( 2^k - 1 \) are:
- \( k = 3 \): \( 7 = 2^3 - 1 \)
- \( k = 5 \): \( 31 = 2^5 - 1 \)
- \( k = 7 \): \( 127 = 2^7 - 1 \)
- \( k = 13 \): \( 8191 = 2^{13} - 1 \)

(b) If \( p = 2^k - 1 \) is prime and \( k > 2 \), then \( k \) must be odd. This is because if \( k \) is even and greater than 2, say \( k = 2m \) with \( m > 1 \), then \( 2^k - 1 = 2^{2m} - 1 = (2^m - 1)(2^m + 1) \), which is a product of two integers each greater than 1, hence composite. The only even \( k \) that works is \( k = 2 \), giving the prime 3.
