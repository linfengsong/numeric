I'll prove that the expression $\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}$ is an integer for all $n \geq 0$.

**Lean 4 statement:**
```lean
theorem factorial_ratio_is_integer (n : ℕ) : (2 * n)! / (2^n * n!) ∈ ℕ := by
  induction' n with k IH
  · simp
  · have : (2 * (k + 1))! / (2^(k + 1) * (k + 1)!) = 
           (2 * k + 1) * (2 * k)! / (2^k * k!) := by
      simp [Nat.pow_succ, Nat.mul_succ, Nat.factorial_succ]
      ring
    rw [this]
    exact Nat.mul_div_mul_left _ _ (by omega) IH
```

**Normal language proof:**

Let's prove this by mathematical induction:

**Base case (n = 0):**
$\frac{(2×0)!}{2^0 × 0!} = \frac{1}{1 × 1} = 1$, which is an integer ✓

**Inductive step:** Assume $\frac{(2k)!}{2^k k!}$ is an integer for some k ≥ 0.
We need to show $\frac{(2(k+1))!}{2^{k+1} (k+1)!}$ is also an integer.

Observe that:
$(2(k+1))! = (2k+2)! = (2k+2)(2k+1)(2k)!$

And:
$2^{k+1}(k+1)! = 2 × 2^k × (k+1) × k!$

So:
$\frac{(2(k+1))!}{2^{k+1}(k+1)!} = \frac{(2k+2)(2k+1)(2k)!}{2(k+1) × 2^k × k!}
= \frac{(2k+1)(2k)!}{2^k × k!}$

Since $\frac{(2k)!}{2^k k!}$ is an integer by the inductive hypothesis, and $(2k+1)$ is also an integer, their product is an integer.

Therefore, by mathematical induction, $\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}$ is an integer for all n ≥ 0.

**Alternative combinatorial interpretation:** This expression counts the number of ways to pair up 2n distinct objects into n unordered pairs, which must be an integer.

**Output:** The expression $\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}$ is indeed an integer for all non-negative integers n.
