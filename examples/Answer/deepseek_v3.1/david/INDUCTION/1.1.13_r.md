Let's prove that \( a_n < 2^n \) for every positive integer \( n \) using the Second Principle of Finite Induction (strong induction).

**Base Cases:**
We need to verify the inequality for \( n = 1, 2, 3 \):
- \( a_1 = 1 < 2^1 = 2 \)
- \( a_2 = 2 < 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( a_3 = 3 < 2^3 = 8 \)
All base cases hold.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume that for all \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq k \leq m \) (with \( m \geq 3 \)), we have \( a_k < 2^k \). We want to prove that \( a_{m+1} < 2^{m+1} \).

By the recurrence:
\[
a_{m+1} = a_m + a_{m-1} + a_{m-2}
\]
Using the inductive hypothesis:
\[
a_m < 2^m, \quad a_{m-1} < 2^{m-1}, \quad a_{m-2} < 2^{m-2}
\]
So,
\[
a_{m+1} < 2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2}
\]
Now, compute the right-hand side:
\[
2^m + 2^{m-1} + 2^{m-2} = 2^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}\right) = 2^m \cdot \frac{7}{4} = \frac{7}{4} \cdot 2^m
\]
We need to show that this is less than \( 2^{m+1} = 2 \cdot 2^m \). Compare:
\[
\frac{7}{4} \cdot 2^m < 2 \cdot 2^m \quad \text{since} \quad \frac{7}{4} = 1.75 < 2
\]
Therefore,
\[
a_{m+1} < \frac{7}{4} \cdot 2^m < 2 \cdot 2^m = 2^{m+1}
\]
So, \( a_{m+1} < 2^{m+1} \), which completes the inductive step.

By the Second Principle of Finite Induction, \( a_n < 2^n \) for every positive integer \( n \).

**Output in Normal Language:**
We have shown by strong induction that for every positive integer \( n \), \( a_n < 2^n \). The base cases \( n = 1, 2, 3 \) are verified directly, and the inductive step uses the recurrence and the inductive hypothesis to bound \( a_{n+1} \) by a geometric series that is less than \( 2^{n+1} \).
