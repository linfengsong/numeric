The Catalan numbers, defined by
$$ C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{n!(n+1)!} \hspace{20pt} n = 0,1,2,...$$
form the sequence 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, .... They first appeared in 1838 when Eugene Catalan (1814-1894) showed that there are Cn ways of parenthesizing a nonassociative product of n + 1 factors. [For instance, when n = 3 there are five ways: ((ab)c)d, (a(bc))d, a((bc)d), a(b(cd)), (ab)(ac).] For n $\geq{1}$, prove that $C_n$ can be given inductively by
$$C_n = \frac{2(2n-1)}{n+1}C_{n-1}$$
