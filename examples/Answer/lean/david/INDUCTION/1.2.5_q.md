(a) For n $\geq{2}$, prove that
       $$\binom{2}{2} + \binom{3}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \ldots + \binom{n}{2} = \binom{n+1}{3}  $$
(b) From part (a), and the relation $m^2 = 2\binom{m}{2} + m$ form $\geq{2}$, deduce the formula
       $$1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \ldots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$
(c) Apply the formula in part (a) to obtain a proof that
       $$ 1·2 + 2·3 + \ldots + n(n+1) = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{3}$$
