Consider the eight-digit bank identification number $a_1a_2 \ldots a_8$, which is followed by a ninth check digit $a_9$ chosen to satisfy the congruence
$$a_9 = 7a_1 + 3a_2 + 9a_3 + 7a_4 + 3a_5 + 9a_6 + 7a_7 + 3a_8\:(mod\:10)$$
(a) Obtain the check digits that should be appended to the two numbers 55382006 and 81372439.
(b) The bank identification number $237a_418538$ has an illegible fourth digit. Determine the value of the obscured digit.
