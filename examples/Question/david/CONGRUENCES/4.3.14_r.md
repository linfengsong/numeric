 We will prove this by induction.

Base case: $n = 1$

For $n = 1$, we need to show that there exists a prime with at least one of its digits equal to 0. This is true, as the prime number 10 has one digit equal to 0.

Inductive step:

Assume that there exists a prime with at least $n$ of its digits equal to 0 for some $n \geq 1$. We need to show that there exists a prime with at least $n+1$ of its digits equal to 0.

Consider the number $N = 10^{n+1} - 2$. This number has $n+2$ digits, and its last $n+1$ digits are 0. We will show that $N$ is prime.

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $N$ is not prime. Then $N$ must have a prime factor $p$ such that $1 < p < N$. Since $N$ ends in $n+1$ zeros, $p$ must also end in $n+1$ zeros. However, the only primes that end in zeros are 2 and 5, and $N$ is clearly not divisible by 2. Therefore, $p$ must end in exactly $n+1$ zeros.

Now, consider the number $M = N - 10^{n+1}$. We have $M = 10^{n+1} - 2 - 10^{n+1} = -2$. Since $M$ is negative, it cannot have a prime factor $p$ such that $1 < p < N$. Therefore, $N$ must be prime.

Thus, we have shown that there exists a prime with at least $n+1$ of its digits equal to 0, completing the inductive step.

By induction, we have proven that for any $n \geq 1$, there exists a prime with at least $n$ of its digits equal to 0.
