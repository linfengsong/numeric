Prove the following statements:
(a) If gcd(a, n) = 1, then the integers
$$c, c +a, c + 2a, c + 3a, ..., c + (n - l)a$$
form a complete set of residues modulo n for any c.
(b) Any n consecutive integers form a complete set of residues modulo n
(c) The product of any set of n consecutive integers is divisible by n.
