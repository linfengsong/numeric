a) Obtain the following generalization of Theorem 4.6: If the integer N is represented in the base b by 
$$N = a_mb^m + \ldots + a_2b^2 + a_1b + a_0 \hspace{24pt} 0 \leq{a_k} \leq{b-1}$$
then b - 1 | N if and only if $b - 1 | ( a_m + \ldots + a_2 + a_1 + a_0 )$.
(b) Give criteria for the divisibility of N by 3 and 8 that depend on the digits of N when written in the base 9.
(c) Is the integer $(447836)_9$ divisible by 3 and 8?
