Establish the following divisibility criteria:
(a) An integer is divisible by 2 if and only if its units digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
(b) An integer is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
(c) An integer is divisible by 4 if and only if the number formed by its tens and units digits is divisible by 4.
[Hint: $10^k = 0$ (mod 4) for $k \geq{2}$.]
(d) An integer is divisible by 5 if and only if its units digit is 0 or 5.
