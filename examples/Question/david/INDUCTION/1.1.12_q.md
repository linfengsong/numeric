Consider the function defined by
$$T(n) = \begin{cases} \frac{3n + 1}{2}\:for\:n\:odd\\\frac{n}{2}\hspace{14pt}for\:n\:even\end{cases}$$
The 3n + 1 conjecture is the claim that starting from any integer n > 1, the sequence of iterates T(n), T(T(n)), T(T(T(n))), ..., eventually reaches the integer 1 and subseÂ­ quently runs through the values 1 and 2. This has been verified for all n $\leq{10^{16}}$. Confirm the conjecture in the cases n=21 and n=23.
