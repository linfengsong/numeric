Confirm the following properties of the greatest common divisor:
    (a) If gcd(a, b) = 1, and gcd(a, c) = 1, then gcd(a, bc)= 1.
        [Hint: Because 1 = ax + by = au+ cv for some x, y, u, v,
        1 =(ax+ by)(au + cv) = a(aux + cvx + byu) + bc(yv).]
    (b) If gcd(a, b) = 1, and c | a, then gcd(b, c) = 1.
    (c) If gcd(a, b) = 1, then gcd( ac, b) = gcd(c, b).
    (d) If gcd(a, b) = 1, and c | a+ b, then gcd(a, c) = gcd(b, c) = 1.
        [Hint: Let d = gcd(a, c). Then d | a, d | c implies that d | (a+ b) - a, or d | b.]
    (e) If gcd(a, b) = 1, d | ac, and d | be, then d | c.
    (f) If gcd(a, b) = 1, then $gcd(a^2, b^2) = 1$.
        [Hint: First show that $gcd(a, b^2) = gcd(a^2, b) = 1$.]
