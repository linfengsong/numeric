Each of the numbers
$$1=1, 3 = 1+2, 6 = 1+2 +3, 10 = 1+2 +3+4, ...$$
represents the number of dots that can be arranged evenly in an equilateral triangle:
$$
\hspace{86pt} \bullet \\
\hspace{44pt} \bullet \hspace{36pt} \bullet \hspace{6pt} \bullet \\
\hspace{16pt} \bullet \hspace{22pt} \bullet \hspace{6pt} \bullet \hspace{24pt} \bullet \hspace{6pt} \bullet \hspace{6pt} \bullet \\
\bullet \hspace{10pt} \bullet \hspace{6pt} \bullet \hspace{10pt} \bullet \hspace{6pt}\bullet \hspace{6pt} \bullet \hspace{10pt} \bullet \hspace{6pt} \bullet \hspace{6pt} \bullet \hspace{6pt} \bullet\\

This led the ancient Greeks to call a number triangular if it is the sum of consecutive integers, beginning with 1. Prove the following facts concerning triangular numbers:
  (a) A number is triangular if and only if it is of the form n(n + 1)/2 for some $n \leq{1}$. (Pythagoras, circa 550 B.C.)
  (b) The integer n is a triangular number if and only if 8n + 1 is a perfect square. (Plutarch, circa 100 AD.)
  (c) The sum of any two consecutive triangular numbers is a perfect square. (Nicomachus, circa 100 AD.)
  (d) If n is a triangular number, then so are 9n + 1, 25n + 3, and 49n + 6. (Euler, 1775)
