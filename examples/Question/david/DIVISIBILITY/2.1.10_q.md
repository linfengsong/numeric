Each of the numbers
$$1, 5 = 1 + 4, 12 = 1 + 4 + 7, 22 = 1 + 4 + 7 + 10, ...$$
       represents the number of dots that can be arranged evenly in a pentagon:


       The ancient Greeks called these pentagonal numbers. If $p_n$ denotes the nth pentagonal number, where $p_1$ = 1 and $p_n = p_{n-1} + (3n - 2)$ for n $\geq{2}$, prove that
$$p_n = \frac{n(3n-1)}{2} \hspace{24pt} n\geq{1}$$
