Fill in any missing details in this sketch of a proof of the infinitude of primes: Assume that there are only finitely many primes, say $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$. Let A be the product of any r of these primes and put $B = p_lp_2···p_n / A$. Then each $p_k$ divides either A or B, but not both. Because A + B > 1, A + B has a prime divisor different from any of the $p_k$ which is a contradiction.
