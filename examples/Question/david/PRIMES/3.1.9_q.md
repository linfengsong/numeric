(a) An unanswered question is whether there are infinitely many primes that are 1 more than a power of 2, such as $5 = 2^2 + 1$. Find two more of these primes.
(b) A more general conjecture is that there exist infinitely many primes of the form $n^2 + 1$; for example, $257 = 16^2 + 1$. Exhibit five more primes of this type.
