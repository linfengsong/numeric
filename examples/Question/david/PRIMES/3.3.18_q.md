(a) If p is a prime and p | b, prove that in the arithmetic progression
$$a, a + b, a + 2b, a + 3b, ...$$
every pth term is divisible by p.
[Hint: Because gcd(p, b) = 1, there exist integers r ands satisfying pr+ bs = 1.
Put $n_k = k_p -as$ for k= 1, 2, ... and show that $p | (a + n_k b)$.]
(b) From part (a), conclude that if b is an odd integer, then every other term in the indicated progression is even.
