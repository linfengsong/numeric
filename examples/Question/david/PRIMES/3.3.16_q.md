Let the sequence of primes, with 1 adjoined, be denoted by $p_0 = 1, p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3, p_3 = 5, ...$. For each $n \geq{1}$, it is known that there exists a suitable choice of coefficients
$ \varepsilon_{k} = ±1$ such that
$$ p_{2n} = p_{2n-l} + \sum_{k=0}^{2n-2} \varepsilon_{k}p_k \hspace{24pt} p_{2n+1} = 2p_{2n} + \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} \varepsilon_{k}p_k$$
To illustrate:
$$13 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 5 + 7 + 11$$
and
$$17 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 5 + 7 - 11 + 2 · 13$$
Determine similar representations for the primes 23, 29, 31, and 37.
