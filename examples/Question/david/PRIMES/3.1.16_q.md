An integer is said to be square-free if it is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1. Prove the following:
(a) An integer n > 1 is square-free if and only if n can be factored into a product of distinct primes.
(b) Every integer n > 1 is the product of a square-free integer and a perfect square.
