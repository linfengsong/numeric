Establish each of the following statements:
(a) Every integer of the form $n^4 + 4$, with n > 1, is composite.
[Hint: Write $n^4 + 4$ as a product of two quadratic factors.]
(b) If n > 4 is composite, then n divides (n - 1)!.
(c) Any integer of the form $8^n + 1$, where n $\geq{1}$, is composite.
[Hint: $2^n + 1 | 2^{3n} + 1$.]
(d) Each integer n > 11 can be written as the sum of two composite numbers.
[Hint: If n is even, say n = 2k, then n - 6 = 2(k - 3); for n odd, consider the integer n - 9.]
