Question:
Please generate a tactic in lean4 to solve the state.\nHere're some theorems that may be helpful:
{α : Sort u} → (p : α → Prop) → (∃ x, p x) → { x // p x }:=\n choice <| let ⟨x, px⟩ := h; ⟨⟨x, px⟩⟩

Answer:
Looking at your code, I can see you're defining a function that extracts a witness from an existential statement. Here's a tactic-based approach to prove this theorem:

theorem exists_to_subtype {α : Sort u} (p : α → Prop) : (∃ x, p x) → { x // p x } := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | intro x hx =>
    use x
    exact hx

Or alternatively, using the choice approach from your original code:

theorem exists_to_subtype' {α : Sort u} (p : α → Prop) : (∃ x, p x) → { x // p x } := by
  intro h
  let ⟨x, px⟩ := h
  use x
  exact px

If you want to use your existing choice function, you could prove it more directly:

-- Assuming you have choice defined somewhere
axiom choice {α : Sort u} (p : α → Prop) : (∃ x, p x) → { x // p x }

theorem exists_to_subtype_with_choice {α : Sort u} (p : α → Prop) : (∃ x, p x) → { x // p x } := by
  exact choice p

The key tactics used here are:

    intro - introduces hypotheses
    cases or let - destructures the existential
    use - constructs the subtype witness
    exact - applies the proof directly

Which approach fits better with what you're trying to accomplish?
